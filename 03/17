In contrast to monolayer graphene, the\nband structure of untwisted bilayer graphene can be further tuned by a\ndisplacement field, providing an extra degree of freedom to control the flat\nband that should appear when two bilayers are stacked on top of each other.\nHere, we report the discovery and characterization of such displacement-field\ntunable electronic phases in twisted double bilayer graphene.

An alternative computing tool is a state of the art\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, which can be easily implemented in the\nStan software. However, we found both existing methods to be inefficient and\noften impractical for large $p$ problems. Following the general idea of\nRajaratnam et al.

We demonstrate with\nsimulated and real data examples that the Markov chains underlying 2BG's\nconverge much faster than that of 3BG's, and no worse than that of HMC. At the\nsame time, the computing costs of 2BG's per iteration are as low as that of\n3BG's, and can be several orders of magnitude lower than that of HMC. As a\nresult, the newly proposed 2BG is the only practical computing solution to do\nBayesian shrinkage analysis for datasets with large $p$. Further, we provide\ntheoretical justifications for the superior performance of 2BG's. We establish\ngeometric ergodicity (GE) of Markov chains associated with the 2BG for each of\nthe three Bayesian shrinkage models.

The process is one-shot in the sense that decisions are\nmade during one time step and that they are final. The term shallow refers to a\none-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systems\nengineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that each\nsubsystem is assigned to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystem\nengineer works independently to maximize their own expected payoff. The goal of\nthe systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizing\nthe subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-based\nsystem-level payoffs, i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all the\ndesign requirements are met. We illustrate the model using the design of an\nEarth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines the\noptimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: the\npropulsion subsystem and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis of\na systems engineer's decisions about optimal passed-down requirements and\nincentives for sub-system engineers under different levels of task difficulty\nand associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems and\nsubsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of the\nsystems engineer to pass down the true requirements. As expected, the model\npredicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties the optimal requirements\nare higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability of\nfailure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that for\nlarge task uncertainties the optimal requirements should be smaller than the\ntrue ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers into participation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 19:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

To compute these diagrams using lattice\ntechniques, one generally uses stochastic noise methods. These employ a\nrandomly generated set of noise vectors to project out physical signals. In\norder to strengthen the signal in these calculations, various noise subtraction\ntechniques may be employed. In addition to the standard method of perturbative\nsubtraction, one may also employ matrix deflation techniques using the GMRES-DR\nand MINRES-DR algorithms as well as polynomial subtraction techniques to reduce\nstatistical uncertainty. Our matrix deflation methods play two roles: they both\nspeed up the solution of the linear equations as well as decrease numerical\nnoise. We show how to combine deflation with either perturbative and polynomial\nmethods to produce extremely powerful noise suppression algorithms. We use a\nvariety of lattices to study the effects. In order to set a benchmark, we first\nuse the Wilson matrix in the quenched approximation. We see strong low\neigenmode dominance at kappa critical ($\\kappa_{crit}$) in the variance of the\nvector and scalar operators.

This result is based on a\ncareful classification and modeling of the population distribution of BATSE\nLGRBs in the 5-dimensional space of redshift as well as intrinsic prompt\ngamma-ray emission properties: peak luminosity, total isotropic emission, the\nspectral peak energy, and the intrinsic duration, while taking into account the\ndetection mechanism of BATSE and sample incompleteness. The underlying\nassumption in our modeling approach is that LGRBs trace the Cosmic Star\nFormation Rate and that the joint 4-dimensional distribution of the\naforementioned prompt gamma-ray emission properties follows a multivariate\nlog-normal distribution. Our modeling approach enables us to constrain the\nredshifts of BATSE LGRBs to average uncertainty ranges of $0.7$ and $1.7$ at\n$50\\%$ and $90\\%$ confidence levels, respectively. Our predictions are almost\nentirely at odds with the previous estimates of BATSE redshifts based on the\nphenomenological high-energy correlations, in particular with the estimates\nderived from the lag-luminosity and the variability-luminosity relations. There\nis, however, a weak but significant correlation of strength $\\sim0.26$ between\nour predicted redshift estimates and those derived from the hardness-brightness\nrelations. The discrepancies between the estimates can be explained by the\nstrong influence of sample incompleteness in shaping the phenomenologically\nproposed high-energy correlations in the literature.

This paper proposes a novel\nmethod to address the VQA problem. In contrast to prior works, our method that\ntargets single scene VQA, replies on graph-based techniques and involves\nreasoning. In a nutshell, our approach is centered on three graphs. The first\ngraph, referred to as inference graph GI , is constructed via learning over\nlabeled data. The other two graphs, referred to as query graph Q and\nentity-attribute graph GEA, are generated from natural language query Qnl and\nimage Img, that are issued from users, respectively. As GEA often does not take\nsufficient information to answer Q, we develop techniques to infer missing\ninformation of GEA with GI . Based on GEA and Q, we provide techniques to find\nmatches of Q in GEA, as the answer of Qnl in Img. Unlike commonly used VQA\nmethods that are based on end-to-end neural networks, our graph-based method\nshows well-designed reasoning capability, and thus is highly interpretable.

Given an\nouterstring graph representation, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem of\nthe underlying graph can be computed in $O(s^3)$ time, where $s$ is the number\nof segments in the representation (Keil et al., Comput. Geom., 60:19--25,\n2017). If the strings are of constant size (e.g., line segments, L-shapes,\netc.), then the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ time.\n  In this paper, we examine the fine-grained complexity of the MIS problem on\nsome well-known outerstring representations. We show that solving the MIS\nproblem on grounded segment and grounded square-L representations is at least\nas hard as solving MIS on circle graph representations. Note that no\n$O(n^{2-\\delta})$-time algorithm, $\\delta>0$, is known for the MIS problem on\ncircle graphs. For the grounded string representations where the strings are\n$y$-monotone simple polygonal paths of constant length with segments at\nintegral coordinates, we solve MIS in $O(n^2)$ time and show this to be the\nbest possible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). For the\nintersection graph of $n$ L-shapes in the plane, we give a $(4\\cdot \\log\nOPT)$-approximation algorithm for MIS (where $OPT$ denotes the size of an\noptimal solution), improving the previously best-known $(4\\cdot \\log\nn)$-approximation algorithm of Biedl and Derka (WADS 2017).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 04:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 19:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The considered SFQ technology is\nsuperconducting digital electronic devices that operate at cryogenic\ntemperatures with active circuit elements called the Josephson junction, which\noperate at high switching speeds and low switching energy - allowing SFQ\ncircuits to operate at frequencies over 300 gigahertz. Due to key differences\nbetween SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as\nadvanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification\ntechniques as the complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework\nfocuses on verifying the key circuit and gate-level properties of SFQ logic:\nfanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output latency. The\ncombinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are:\nKogge-Stone adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select\nISCAS'85 combinational benchmark circuits. Methods of introducing bugs into SFQ\ncircuit designs for verification detection were experimented with - including\nstuck-at faults, fanout errors, unbalanced paths, and functional bugs like\nincorrect logic gates. In addition, we propose an SFQ verification benchmark\nconsisting of combinational SFQ circuits that exemplify SFQ logic properties\nand present the performance of the VeriSFQ framework on these benchmark\ncircuits. The portability and reusability of the UVM standard allows the\nVeriSFQ framework to serve as a foundation for future SFQ semi-formal\nverification techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 04:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

The ubiquity of\nalgebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to\nseveral variants of universal algebra, such as symmetric operads, non-symmetric\noperads, generalised operads, and monads. These variants of universal algebra\nare called notions of algebraic theory. In the first part of this thesis, we\ndevelop a unified framework for notions of algebraic theory which includes all\nof the above examples. Our key observation is that each notion of algebraic\ntheory can be identified with a monoidal category, in such a way that theories\ncorrespond to monoid objects therein. We introduce a categorical structure\ncalled metamodel, which underlies the definition of models of theories. We also\nconsider morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal\nversion of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint\npair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform way to establish isomorphisms\nbetween categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory. A\ngeneral structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical\nuniversal property of categories of models are also shown.\n  In the second part of this thesis, we shift from the general study of\nalgebraic structures, and focus on a particular algebraic structure: higher\ndimensional categories. Among several existing definitions of higher\ndimensional categories, we choose to look at the one proposed by Batanin and\nlater refined by Leinster. We show that the notion of extensive category plays\na central role in Batanin and Leinster's definition. Using this, we generalise\ntheir definition by allowing enrichment over any locally presentable extensive\ncategory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 05:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

We then show that if a conjugacy class $[w]$ in $F_N$ is sufficiently\nclose to a \"filling\" projective geodesic current $[\\nu]\\in PCurr(F_N)$, then,\nafter applying a single \"reducing\" automorphism $\\psi=\\psi(\\nu)\\in Out(F_N)$\ndepending on $\\nu$ only, the element $\\psi([w])$ is $(M,\\lambda,\n\\epsilon)$-minimal for some uniform constants $M,\\lambda,\\epsilon$.\nConsequently, for such $[w]$, Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic\nequivalence problem in $F_N$ works in quadratic time on the input $([w], [w'])$\nwhere $[w']$ is arbitrary, and in linear time if $[w']$ is also projectively\nclose to $[\\nu]$. We then show that a wide class of random processes produce\n\"random\" conjugacy classes $[w_n]$ that projectively converge to some filling\ncurrent in $PCurr(F_N)$. For such $[w_n]$ Whitehead's algorithm has at most\nquadratic generic-case complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 07:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

Feature selection provides an\neffective way for solving these problems by removing irrelevant and redundant\nfeatures, thus reducing model complexity and improving accuracy and\ngeneralization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a novel\nteacher-student feature selection (TSFS) method in which a 'teacher' (a deep\nneural network or a complicated dimension reduction method) is first employed\nto learn the best representation of data in low dimension. Then a 'student'\nnetwork (a simple neural network) is used to perform feature selection by\nminimizing the reconstruction error of low dimensional representation. Although\nthe teacher-student scheme is not new, to the best of our knowledge, it is the\nfirst time that this scheme is employed for feature selection. The proposed\nTSFS can be used for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. This\nmethod is evaluated on different datasets and is compared with state-of-the-art\nexisting feature selection methods. The results show that TSFS performs better\nin terms of classification and clustering accuracies and reconstruction error.\nMoreover, experimental evaluations demonstrate a low degree of sensitivity to\nparameter selection in the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 09:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

First we discuss a NMC\ngravity model which constitutes a natural extension of $1/R^n$ gravity to the\nnonminimally coupled case. Such a NMC gravity model is able to predict the\nobserved accelerated expansion of the Universe. Differently from the\n$f(R)=1/R^n$ gravity case, which is not compatible with Solar System\nobservations, it turns out that this NMC model is a viable theory of gravity.\nThen we consider a further NMC gravity model which admits Minkowski spacetime\nas a background, and we derive the $1/c$ expansion of the metric. The\nnonrelativistic limit of the model is not Newtonian, but contains a Yukawa\ncorrection. We look for trajectories around a static, spherically symmetric\nbody. Since in NMC gravity the energy-momentum tensor of matter is not\nconserved, then the trajectories deviate from geodesics. We use the NMC gravity\nmodel to compute the perihelion precession of planets and we constrain the\nparameters of the model from radar observations of Mercury.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 11:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

In UOWSNs energy\nlimitation is another major problem due to the limited battery power and\ndifficulty to replace or recharge the battery of an underwater sensor node. In\nthe proposed framework, sensor nodes with insufficient battery harvest ambient\nenergy and start communicating once they have sufficient storage of energy.\nNetwork localization is carried out by measuring the RSSs of active nodes,\nwhich are modeled based on the underwater optical communication channel\ncharacteristics. Thereafter, block kernel matrices are computed for RSS-based\nrange measurements. Unlike the traditional shortest-path approach, the proposed\ntechnique reduces the estimation error of the shortest path for each block\nkernel matrix. Once the complete block kernel matrices are available, a closed\nform localization technique is developed to find the location of every optical\nsensor node in the network. An analytical expression for the Cramer Rao lower\nbound (CRLB) is also derived as a benchmark to evaluate the localization\nperformance of the developed technique.

To recognise most gestural actions, often higher\ntemporal precision is required for sampling visual information. Actions are\ndefined by motion, and therefore, when using event-based cameras it is often\nunnecessary to re-sample the entire scene. Neuromorphic, event-based cameras\nhave presented an alternative to visual information acquisition by\nasynchronously time-encoding pixel intensity changes, through temporally\nprecise spikes (10 micro-second resolution), making them well equipped for\naction recognition. However, other challenges exist, which are intrinsic to\nevent-based imagers, such as higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a\nspatiotemporally sparse information. One option is to convert event-data into\nframes, but this could result in significant temporal precision loss. In this\nwork we introduce spatiotemporal filtering in the spike-event domain, as an\nalternative way of channeling spatiotemporal information through to a\nconvolutional neural network. The filters are local spatiotemporal weight\nmatrices, learned from the spike-event data, in an unsupervised manner. We find\nthat appropriate spatiotemporal filtering significantly improves CNN\nperformance beyond state-of-the-art on the event-based DVS Gesture dataset. On\nour newly recorded action recognition dataset, our method shows significant\nimprovement when compared with other, standard ways of generating the\nspatiotemporal filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 12:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Here, we explore the wrapping of a\nlipid membrane around a long cylindrical object in the presence of a substrate\nmimicking the cytoskeleton. Using discretization of the Helfrich elastic energy\nthat accounts for the membrane bending rigidity and surface tension, we obtain\na wrapping phase diagram as a function of the membrane-cytoskeleton and the\nmembrane-target adhesion energy that includes unwrapped, partially wrapped and\nfully wrapped states. We provide an analytical expression for the boundary\nbetween the different regimes. While the transition to partial wrapping is\nindependent of membrane tension, the transition to full wrapping is very much\ninfluenced by membrane tension. We also show that target wrapping may proceed\nin an asymmetric fashion in the full wrapping regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 12:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

This leads to an\ninterpretation of Quantum Mechanics which is unitary at the level of a single\nworld. I argue that unitary evolution is consistent with both quantum\nmeasurements and the apparent classicality at the macroscopic level. This\nallows us to take the wavefunction as ontic (but holistic), but a global\nconsistency condition has to be introduced to ensure this compatibility. I\njustify this by appealing to sheaf cohomology on the block universe. As a\nconsequence, Quantum Theory turns out to be consistent with a definite\nfour-dimensional spacetime, even if this may consist of superpositions of\ndifferent geometries. But the block universe subject to global consistency\ngains a new flavor, which for an observer experiencing the flow of time appears\nas \"superdeterministic\" or \"retrocausal\", although this does not manifest\nitself in observations in a way which would allow the violation of causality.\nHowever, the block universe view offers another interpretation of this\nbehavior, which makes more sense, and removes the tension with causality. Such\na block universe subject to global consistency appears thus as being\npost-determined. Here \"post-determined\" means that for an observer the block\nuniverse appears as not being completely determined from the beginning, but\neach new quantum observation eliminates some of the possible block universe\nsolutions consistent with the previous observations. I compare the\npost-determined block universe with other proposals: the presentist view, the\nblock universe, the splitting block universe, and the growing block universe,\nand explain how it combines their major advantages in a qualitatively different\npicture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 12:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 19:20:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 05:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

In\nthis paper, we study this phenomenon from an effective field theory (EFT)\nperspective. We employ a novel approach to constructing the effective\npoint-particle action for the black hole by integrating out a set of composite\noperators localized on its worldline. This procedure, carried out using the\nin-in formalism, enables a systematic accounting of both conservative and\ndissipative effects associated with the black hole's horizon at the level of\nthe action. We show that the induced scalar charge is inextricably linked to\naccretion of the background environment, as both effects stem from the same\nparent term in the effective action. The charge, in turn, implies that a black\nhole can radiate scalar waves and will also experience a \"fifth force.\" Our EFT\ncorrectly reproduces known results in the literature for massless scalars, but\nnow also generalizes to massive real scalar fields, allowing us to consider a\nwider range of scenarios of astrophysical interest.

Hence, we\nexplore the feasibility of directly integrating prediction functionality on top\nof a data store or DB. Such a system ideally: (i) provides an intuitive\nprediction query interface which alleviates the unwieldy data engineering; (ii)\nprovides state-of-the-art statistical accuracy while ensuring incremental model\nupdate, low model training time and low latency for making predictions. As the\nmain contribution we explicitly instantiate a proof-of-concept, tspDB, which\ndirectly integrates with PostgreSQL. We rigorously test tspDB's statistical and\ncomputational performance against the state-of-the-art time series algorithms,\nincluding a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural network and DeepAR (industry\nstandard deep learning library by Amazon). Statistically, on standard time\nseries benchmarks, tspDB outperforms LSTM and DeepAR with 1.1-1.3x higher\nrelative accuracy. Computationally, tspDB is 59-62x and 94-95x faster compared\nto LSTM and DeepAR in terms of median ML model training time and prediction\nquery latency, respectively. Further, compared to PostgreSQL's bulk insert time\nand its SELECT query latency, tspDB is slower only by 1.3x and 2.6x\nrespectively. That is, tspDB is a real-time prediction system in that its model\ntraining / prediction query time is similar to just inserting / reading data\nfrom a DB. As an algorithmic contribution, we introduce an incremental\nmultivariate matrix factorization based time series method, which tspDB is\nbuilt off. We show this method also allows one to produce reliable prediction\nintervals by accurately estimating the time-varying variance of a time series,\nthereby addressing an important problem in time series analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 14:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 04:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 03:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 20:41:47 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 20:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 17:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

Initially, the second class particle\nis located at the origin and to its left, all sites are occupied with first\nclass particles while to its right, all sites are vacant. Ferrari and Kipnis\nproved that in any particular realization, the average velocity of the second\nclass particle tends to a constant, but this mean value has a wide variation in\ndifferent histories. We discuss this phenomena, here called the TASEP Speed\nProcess, in an approximate effective medium description, in which the second\nclass particle moves in a random background of the space-time dependent average\ndensity of the first class particles. We do this in three different\napproximations of increasing accuracy, treating the motion of the second-class\nparticle first as a simple biassed random walk in a continuum Langevin\nequation, then as a biased Markovian random walk with space and time dependent\njump rates, and finally as a Non-Markovian biassed walk with a non-exponential\ndistribution of waiting times between jumps. We find that, when the\ndisplacement at time $T$ is $x_0$, the conditional expectation of displacement,\nat time $zT$ ($z>1$) is $zx_0$, and the variance of the displacement only\nvaries as $z(z-1)T$.
