We present a modification of the embedded atom method (EAM) which\nallows for electronic polarization of the metal by treating the valence density\naround each atom as a fluctuating dynamical quantity. The densities are\nrepresented by a set of additional fluctuating variables (and their conjugate\nmomenta) which are propagated along with the nuclear coordinates. This\n``density readjusting EAM'' (DR-EAM) preserves nearly all of the useful\nqualities of traditional EAM, including bulk elastic properties and surface\nenergies. However, it also allows valence electron density to migrate through\nthe metal in response to external perturbations. We show that DR-EAM can\nsuccessfully model polarization in response to external charges, capturing the\nimage charge effect in atomistic simulations. DR-EAM also captures some of the\nbehavior of metals in the presence of uniform electric fields, predicting\nsurface charging and shielding internal to the metal. We further show that it\npredicts charge transfer between the constituent atoms in alloys, leading to\nnovel predictions about unit cell geometries in layered L$1_0$ structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 18:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

In multiplex networks, flows can\noccur both within and across layers, and super-diffusion, a regime where the\ntime scale of the multiplex to reach equilibrium is smaller than that of single\nnetworks in isolation, can emerge due to the interplay of these two mechanisms.\nIn the limits of strong and weak inter-layer couplings multiplex diffusion has\nbeen linked to the spectrum of the supra-Laplacian associated to the system.\nHowever, a general theory for the emergence of this behavior is still lacking.\nHere we shed light on how the structural and dynamical features of the\nmultiplex affect the Laplacian spectral properties. For instance, we find that\nsuper-diffusion emerges the earliest in systems with poorly diffusive layers,\nand that its onset is independent from the presence of overlap, which only\ninfluences the maximum relative intensity of the phenomenon. Moreover, a\nuniform allocation of resources to enhance diffusion within layers is\npreferable, as highly intra-layer heterogenous flows might hamper\nsuper-diffusion. Last, in multiplex networks formed by many layers, diffusion\nis best promoted by strengthening inter-layer flows across dissimilar layers.\nOur work can turn useful for the design of interconnected infrastructures in\nreal-world transportation systems, clarifying the determinants able to drive\nthe system towards the super-diffusive regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 18:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

In order to\nventure into the highly challenging spectral regions and extremely weak signals\ninvolved with these searches (especially for the DFSZ axions), a different\nscheme is proposed departing from the conventional resonant cavity mass scan\nand heterodyne detection methods. We aim to look for a fixed mass axionic field\nand concentrate our search at the corresponding resonant frequency and its\nhigher harmonics using a simple phase-sensitive dc detection method, which\ncould possibly be helpful in substantially reducing both the hardware,\nexperiment complexities and long run times.

However, the few proposed solutions are limited to the problem\nof decomposing solids described through their boundaries. In this thesis we\nstudy the problem of decomposing an arbitrary non-manifold simplicial complex\ninto more regular components. A formal notion of decomposition is developed\nusing combinatorial topology. The proposed decomposition is unique, for a given\ncomplex, and is computable for complexes of any dimension. A decomposition\nalgorithm is proposed that is linear w.r.t. the size of the input. In three or\nhigher dimensions a decomposition into manifold parts is not always possible.\nThus, in higher dimensions, we decompose a non-manifold into a decidable super\nclass of manifolds, that we call, Initial-Quasi-Manifolds. We also defined a\ntwo-layered data structure, the Extended Winged data structure. This data\nstructure is a dimension independent data structure conceived to model\nnon-manifolds through their decomposition into initial-quasi-manifold parts.\nOur two layered data structure describes the structure of the decomposition and\neach component separately. In the second layer we encode the connectivity\nstructure of the decomposition. We analyze the space requirements of the\nExtended Winged data structure and give algorithms to build and navigate it.\nFinally, we discuss time requirements for the computation of topological\nrelations and show that, for surfaces and tetrahedralizations, embedded in real\n3D space, all topological relations can be extracted in optimal time. This\napproach offers a compact, dimension independent, representation for\nnon-manifolds that can be useful whenever the modeled object has few\nnon-manifold singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 23:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

The result by the PNMDE collaboration, $\\sum_{q=u,d,s} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\n{\\Delta q} \\right] = 0.143(31)(36) $, is consistent with the COMPASS analysis\n$0.13 < \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta \\Sigma < 0.18$. Results for $J_q$ and $J_g$ by the\nETMC collaborations are also consistent with phenomenology.

With much larger computing resources\nanticipated over the next five years, high precision results for all three will\nbecome available and provide a detailed description of their relative\ncontributions to the nucleon spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 00:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

The peculiar angular variation of the response with\nrespect to the relative alignments of the magnetization, magnetic field, and\ncurrent reveal the two underlying microscopic mechanisms:\nspin-polarization-dependent scattering of a Zeeman-shifted Fermi surface and\nmagnetoresistance driven by the anomalous velocity physics usually associated\nwith the anomalous Hall effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 03:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

When the extended Kalman\nfilter (EKF) is applied to such systems for state estimation, the outliers can\nseriously reduce the estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an innovation\nsaturation mechanism to modify the EKF toward building robustness against\noutliers. This mechanism applies a saturation function to the innovation\nprocess that the EKF leverages to correct the state estimation. As such, when\nan outlier occurs, the distorting innovation is saturated and thus prevented\nfrom damaging the state estimation. The mechanism features an adaptive\nadjustment of the saturation bound. The design leads to the development robust\nEKF approaches for continuous- and discrete-time systems. They are proven to be\ncapable of generating bounded-error estimation in the presence of bounded\noutlier disturbances. An application study about mobile robot localization is\npresented, with the numerical simulation showing the efficacy of the proposed\ndesign.

These objects will produce a significant amount of data. The\ntraditional cloud computing architecture aims to process data in the cloud. As\na result, a significant amount of data needs to be communicated to the cloud.\nThis creates a number of challenges, such as high communication latency between\nthe devices and the cloud, increased energy consumption of devices during\nfrequent data upload to the cloud, high bandwidth consumption, while making the\nnetwork busy by sending the data continuously, and less privacy because of less\ncontrol on the transmitted data to the server.

However,\ncombining the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with the fog computing\narchitecture is still an open challenge.

Evaluation of the four\narchitectures shows that decomposing services into nodes reduce the data\nconsumption over the network by 10% - 70%.

Most countermeasures are tailored for CMOS integration and tend to\nincur excessive overheads, resulting from additional circuitry or device-level\nmodifications. On the other hand, power density is a critical concern for\nsub-50 nm nodes, necessitating alternate design concepts. Although initially\ntailored for error-tolerant applications, imprecise computing has gained\ntraction as a general-purpose design technique. Emerging devices are currently\nbeing explored to implement ultra-low-power circuits for inexact computing\napplications. In this paper, we quantify the security threats of imprecise\ncomputing using emerging devices. More specifically, we leverage the innate\npolymorphism and tunable stochastic behavior of spin-orbit torque (SOT)\ndevices, particularly, the giant spin-Hall effect (GSHE) switch. We enable IP\nprotection (by means of logic locking and camouflaging) simultaneously for\ndeterministic and probabilistic computing, directly at the GSHE device level.\nWe conduct a comprehensive security analysis using state-of-the-art Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT) attacks; this study demonstrates the superior resilience\nof our GSHE primitive when tailored for deterministic computing. We also\ndemonstrate how probabilistic computing can thwart most, if not all, existing\nSAT attacks. Based on this finding, we propose an attack scheme called\nprobabilistic SAT (PSAT) which can bypass the defense offered by logic locking\nand camouflaging for imprecise computing schemes. Further, we illustrate how\ncareful application of our GSHE primitive can remain secure even on the\napplication of the PSAT attack. Finally, we also discuss side-channel attacks\nand invasive monitoring, which are arguably even more concerning threats than\nSAT attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 14:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

This is because of the potential to remove human experts from the\ndesign loop which can reduce costs and decrease time to model deployment.\nNeural architecture search (NAS) techniques have improved significantly in\ntheir computational efficiency since the original NAS was proposed. This\nreduction in computation is enabled via weight sharing such as in Efficient\nNeural Architecture Search (ENAS). However, recently a body of work confirms\nour discovery that ENAS does not do significantly better than random search\nwith weight sharing, contradicting the initial claims of the authors. We\nprovide an explanation for this phenomenon by investigating the\ninterpretability of the ENAS controller's hidden state. We find models sampled\nfrom identical controller hidden states have no correlation with various graph\nsimilarity metrics, so no notion of structural similarity is learned. This\nfailure mode implies the RNN controller does not condition on past architecture\nchoices. Lastly, we propose a solution to this failure mode by forcing the\ncontroller's hidden state to encode pasts decisions by training it with a\nmemory buffer of previously sampled architectures. Doing this improves hidden\nstate interpretability by increasing the correlation between controller hidden\nstates and graph similarity metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 15:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

Similarly to\nfinancial debt, technical debt requires payment of interest in the form of the\nadditional development effort that could have been avoided if the quick and\ndirty design choices have not been made. Technical debt applies to all the\naspects of software development, spanning from initial requirements analysis to\ndeployment, and software evolution. Technical debt is becoming very popular\nfrom scientific and industrial perspectives. In particular, there is an\nincrease in the number of related papers over the years. There is also an\nincrease in the number of related tools and of their adoption in the industry,\nespecially since technical debt is very pricey and therefore needs to be\nmanaged. However, techniques to estimate technical debt are inadequate,\ninsufficient since they mostly focus on requirements, code, and test,\ndisregarding key artifacts such as the software architecture and the\ntechnologies used by the software at hand. Besides, despite its high relevance,\ntechnical debt prediction is one of the least explored aspects of technical\ndebt. To address these shortcomings, it is mandatory that I undertake research\nto: 1) improve existing techniques to properly estimate technical debt; 2) to\ndetermine the extent to which the use of prediction techniques to foresee and\ntherefore avoid technical debt could help companies save money and avoid a\npotential bankruptcy in the subsequent years. The proposed research can have an\nimportant economic impact by helping companies save several millions.

We plot a regime map to\nclassify three deposit types - discontinuous monolayer ring, continuous\nmonolayer ring, and multiple layers ring - on particles concentration -\nparticle size plane. Our data shows a possible existence of a critical\nconcentration (particle size) for a given particle size (concentration) at\nwhich the monolayer ring forms. For the larger particle sizes, the immersion\ncapillary forces between the particles dominate, aiding the formation of a\nmonolayer ring of the particles. The relative mass of the particles accumulated\nin the ring is lesser in cases of the monolayer ring. We measure the width and\nheight of the ring and show that they scale with particle concentration by a\npower law for the multiple layers ring. This scaling corroborates with an\nexisting continuum based theoretical model. We briefly discuss the effect of\nthe interaction of growing deposit with shrinking free surface on the ring\ndimensions and profile. The present results aid understanding of the ring\nformation process and will be useful in guiding the design of self-assemblies\nof the colloidal particles formed by the evaporating droplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 15:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

We develop a finite element (FE) model in\ntwo-dimensional axisymmetric coordinates to solve coupled transport of heat in\nthe droplet and substrate, and of the mass of liquid vapor in surrounding\nambient while assuming diffusion-limited, quasi-steady evaporation of the\ndroplet. The two-way coupling is implemented using an iterative scheme and\nunder-relaxation is used to ensure numerical stability. The FE model is\nvalidated against the published spatial profile of the evaporation mass flux\nand temperature of the liquid-gas interface. We discuss cases in which the\ntwo-way coupling is significantly accurate than the one-way coupling. In\nexperiments, we visualized side view of an evaporating microliter water droplet\nusing a high-speed camera at different substrate temperatures and recorded\ntemperature of the liquid-gas interface from the top using an infrared camera.\nWe examine the dependency of inversion of the temperature profile across the\nliquid-gas interface on the ratio of the substrate thickness to the wetted\nradius, the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the substrate to that of the\ndroplet and contact angle. A comparison of measured evaporation mass rate with\nthe computed values at different substrate temperature show that the\nevaporation mass rate increases non-linearly with respect to the substrate\ntemperature, and FE model predicts these values close to the experimental data.\nComparisons of time-averaged evaporation mass rate obtained by the previous and\npresent models against the measurements suggest that the evaporative cooling at\nthe interface and variation of diffusion coefficient with temperature should be\ntaken into account in the model in order to accurately capture the\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 15:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}
