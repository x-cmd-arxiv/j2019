The evolution of massive stars is strongly influenced by internal\nmixing processes such as semiconvection, convective core overshooting, and\nrotationally induced mixing.

We\naim to constrain the various mixing efficiencies by comparing model results to\nobservations. Methods. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to compute more\nthan 60 grids of detailed evolutionary models for stars with initial masses of\n9 to 100 Msol, in each grid assuming different combinations of mixing\nefficiencies. Results. We find that for most of the combinations of the mixing\nefficiencies, models in a wide mass range spend core-helium burning either only\nas blue supergiants, or only as red supergiants. The latter case corresponds to\nmodels that maintain a shallow slope of the hydrogen/helium (H/He) gradient\nseparating the core and the envelope of the models. Only a small part of the\nmixing parameter space leads to models that produce a significant number of\nblue and red supergiants, which both exist abundantly in the SMC.\nInterestingly, these models contain steep H/He gradients, as is required to\nunderstand the hot, hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars in the SMC.

While we use specific implementations of the\nconsidered mixing processes, they comprehensively probe the two first order\nstructural parameters: the core mass and the H/He gradient in the core-envelope\ninterface. Our results imply that, in massive stars, the H/He gradients above\nthe helium cores become very steep.

In this work, we employ the density\nfunctional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) formalism to\naddress local correlations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional\nphase stability in the prototype rechargeable battery cathode material LixCoO2,\nand detailed comparisons are made with the simpler DFT+U approach (i.e. the\nHartree-Fock solution of the DMFT impurity problem). Local interactions are\nfound to strongly impact the energetics of the band insulator LiCoO2, most\nsignificantly via the Eg orbitals, which are partially occupied via\nhybridization with O p states. We find CoO2 and Li1/2CoO2 to be moderately\ncorrelated Fermi liquids with quasiparticle weights of 0.6-0.8 for the T2g\nstates, which are most impacted by the interactions. As compared to DFT+U,\nDFT+DMFT considerably dampens the increase in total energy as U is increased,\nwhich indicates that dynamical correlations are important to describe this\nclass of materials despite the relatively modest quasiparticle weights.

For the general case of an arbitrary joint distribution for the asset\nreturns, under certain conditions, we characterize the optimal portfolio as the\noptimal Lagrange multiplier associated to an equality-constrained dual problem.\nThen, we consider the special case of Gaussian returns for which it is possible\nto identify all cases where an optimal solution exists and to give an explicit\nformula for the optimal portfolio whenever it exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 16:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 11:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 12:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Such techniques require sampling which is not\nfeasible on museum collections. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a\nnon-invasive 3D imaging technique, that produces virtual cross sections of\ntransparent and semi-transparent materials. Liang et al.

Static\npopulation structures can be described by graphs, where individuals occupy the\nnodes, and interactions occur along the edges. General conditions for\nevolutionary success on any weighted graph were recently derived, for weak\nselection, in terms of coalescence times of random walks. Here we show that for\na special class of graphs, the conditions for success take a particularly\nsimple form, in which all effects of graph structure are described by the\ngraph's \"effective degree\"---a measure of the effective number of neighbors per\nindividual. This result holds for all weighted graphs that are isothermal,\nmeaning that the sum of edge weights is the same at each node. Isothermal\ngraphs encompass a wide variety of underlying topologies, and arise naturally\nfrom supposing that each individual devotes the same amount of time to\ninteraction. Cooperative behavior is favored on a large isothermal graph if the\nbenefit-to-cost ratio exceeds the effective degree. We relate the effective\ndegree of a graph to its spectral gap, thereby providing a link between\nevolutionary dynamics and the theory of expander graphs. As a surprising\nexample, we report graphs of infinite average degree that are nonetheless\nhighly conducive for promoting cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 17:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

For this purpose, we solve the field equations of the $U(1)$\ngauge-scalar model to obtain the static vortex solution in the whole range\nwithout restricting to the long-distance region. Then we use the resulting\nmagnetic field of the vortex to fit the gauge-invariant chromoelectric field\nconnecting a pair of quark and antiquark which was measured by numerical\nsimulations for $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills theory on a lattice. This result improves\nthe accuracy of the fitted value for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter to\nreconfirm the type I dual superconductivity for quark confinement which was\nclaimed by preceding works based on a fitting using the Clem ansatz. Moreover,\nwe calculate the Maxwell stress tensor to obtain the distribution of the force\naround the flux tube.

The simple and\ncomputationally very inexpensive $d-p$ model reproduces correctly nontrivial\nspin-orbital order observed in undoped LaMnO$_3$. Orbital order is very robust\nand is reduced by $\\sim 3$ \\% for large self-doping in the metallic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 19:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

The durations of X-class\nflares range from a few minutes to a few hours, and the same is true of M- and\nC-class flares. In this work, we therefore examine the statistical\nrelationships between the basic properties of flares -- temperature, emission\nmeasure, energy, etc. -- in comparison to both their size and duration. We find\nthat the size of the flare is directly related to all of these basic\nproperties, as previously found by many authors.

In larger flares, however, there are direct\ncorrelations between the GOES FWHM and magnetic reconnection flux and ribbon\narea. We discuss the possible explanations, finding that this discrepancy may\nbe due to large uncertainties in small flares, though we cannot rule out the\npossibility that the driving physical processes are different in smaller flares\nthan larger ones.

The proposed unsupervised technique,\nnamed Probabilistic Surface Optimization (PSO), views a model as a flexible\nsurface which can be pushed according to loss-specific virtual stochastic\nforces, where a dynamical equilibrium is achieved when the pointwise forces on\nthe surface become equal. Concretely, the surface is pushed up and down at\npoints sampled from two different distributions. The averaged up and down\nforces become functions of these two distribution densities and of force\nmagnitudes defined by the loss of a particular PSO instance. Upon convergence,\nthe force equilibrium imposes an optimized model to be equal to various\nstatistical functions depending on the used magnitude functions. Furthermore,\nthis dynamical-statistical equilibrium is extremely intuitive and useful,\nproviding many implications and possible usages in probabilistic inference. We\nconnect PSO to numerous existing statistical works which are also PSO\ninstances, and derive new PSO-based inference methods as demonstration of PSO\nexceptional usability. Likewise, based on the insights coming from the\nvirtual-force perspective we analyze PSO stability and propose new ways to\nimprove it. Finally, we present new instances of PSO, termed PSO-LDE, for data\nlog-density estimation and also provide a new NN block-diagonal architecture\nfor increased surface flexibility, which significantly improves estimation\naccuracy.

Moreover, WR11 is not the only radio source within the Fermi\ndetection box. Other possible counterparts have been identified in archival\ndata, some of which present strong non-thermal radio emission. We conducted\n\"-resolution observations towards WR11 at very low frequencies (150 to\n1400~MHz) where the NT emission is expected to dominate, and present a catalog\nof more than 400 radio-emitters, among which a significant part is detected at\nmore than one frequency, including limited spectral index information.

Notwithstanding, the new radio data allowed to derive a\nmass loss rate of 0.000025 Mo/yr, which, according to the latest models for\ngamma-ray emission in WR 11, would suffice to provide the required kinetic\npower to feed non-thermal radiation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 19:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Polarization information is represented by Stokes\nparameters, a set of 4 energetic parameters widely used in polarimetric\nimaging. QNMF relies on two key ingredients: (i) the algebraic representation\nof Stokes parameters thanks to quaternions and (ii) the exploitation of\nphysical constraints on Stokes parameters. These constraints generalize\nnon-negativity to the case of polarized signals, encoding positive\nsemi-definiteness of the covariance matrix associated which each source.\nUniqueness conditions for QNMF are presented. Remarkably, they encompass known\nsufficient uniqueness conditions from NMF. Meanwhile, QNMF further relaxes NMF\nuniqueness conditions requiring sources to exhibit a certain zero-pattern, by\nleveraging the complete polarization information.

The SC order parameter in 2M-WS2\nis determined to have single-gap s-wave symmetry. We further show a strong\nnegative pressure effect on Tc and on the SC gap.

The absence of a strong pressure effect on the superfluid density\nand the absence of a correlation between ns and Tc in 2M-WS2, in contrast to\nthe other SC TMDs Td-MoTe2 and 2H-NbSe2, is explained in terms of its location\nin the optimal (ambient pressure) and above the optimal (under pressure)\nsuperconducting regions of the phase diagram and its large distance to the\nother possible competing or cooperating orders.

As performance data accumulates during the run of\nthe software, updating the performance models becomes necessary. To this end,\nthere are two conventional modeling methods: the retrained modeling that always\ndiscard the old model and retrain a new one using all available data; or the\nincremental modeling that retains the existing model and tunes it using one\nnewly arrival data sample. Generally, literature on machine learning based\nperformance modeling for adaptable software chooses either of those methods\naccording to a general belief, but they provide insufficient evidences or\nreferences to justify their choice.

We consider two sets of model clouds\ndiffering in the energy content of their velocity fields. In the first,\nself--virialised set, the turbulent kinetic energies are chosen to be close in\nmagnitude to the clouds' self--gravitational potential energies. Comparison\nwith isolated clouds evolving without an external potential shows that the\nself--virialised clouds are unable to withstand the compressive tidal field of\nthe CMZ and rapidly collapse, forming stars much faster and reaching gas\nexhaustion after a small fraction of a Galactocentric orbit. In the second,\ntidally--virialised, set of simulations, the clouds' turbulent kinetic energies\nare in equilibrium with the external tidal field. These models are better\nsupported against the field and the stronger turbulence suppresses star\nformation. Our results strongly support the inference that anomalously low star\nformation rates in the CMZ are due primarily to high velocity dispersions in\nthe molecular gas. The clouds follow open, eccentric orbits oscillating in all\nthree spatial coordinates. We examine the consequences of the orbital dynamics,\nparticularly pericentre passage, by performing companion simulations of clouds\non circular orbits. The increased tidal forces at pericentre produce transient\naccelerations in star formation rates of at most a factor of 2.7.

As a result, secure state estimation is a critical\nrequirement for the control of these systems. Many existing secure state\nestimation methods suffer from combinatorial complexity which grows with the\nnumber of states and sensors in the system. This complexity can be mitigated\nusing optimization-based methods that relax the original state estimation\nproblem, although at the cost of optimality as these methods often identify\nattack-free sensors as attacked. In this paper, we propose a new optimal\ngraph-search algorithm to correctly identify malicious attacks and to securely\nestimate the states even in large-scale CPS modeled as linear time-invariant\nsystems. The graph consists of layers, each one containing two nodes capturing\na truth assignment of any given sensor, and directed edges connecting adjacent\nlayers only. Then, our algorithm searches the layers of this graph\nincrementally, favoring directions at higher layers with more attack-free\nassignments, while actively managing a repository of nodes to be expanded at\nlater iterations. The proposed search bias and the ability to revisit nodes in\nthe repository and self-correct, allow our graph-search algorithm to reach the\noptimal assignment faster and tackle larger problems. We show that our\nalgorithm is complete and optimal provided that process and measurement noises\ndo not dominate the attack signal. Moreover, we provide numerical simulations\nthat demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to correctly identify attacked\nsensors and securely reconstruct the state. Our simulations show that our\nmethod outperforms existing algorithms both in terms of optimality and\nexecution time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 22:24:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 08:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 02:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 03:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Such\nevents are marked by the production of large amounts of debris as has been\nobserved in some exceptionally bright and young debris disks (termed extreme\ndebris disks). Here we report five years of Spitzer measurements of such\nsystems around two young solar-type stars: ID8 and P1121. The short-term\n(weekly to monthly) and long-term (yearly) disk variability is consistent with\nthe aftermaths of large impacts involving large asteroid-size bodies. We\ndemonstrate that an impact-produced clump of optically thick dust, under the\ninfluence of the dynamical and viewing geometry effects, can produce short-term\nmodulation in the disk light curves. The long-term disk flux variation is\nrelated to the collisional evolution within the impact-produced fragments once\nreleased into a circumstellar orbit. The time-variable behavior observed in the\nP1121 system is consistent with a hypervelocity impact prior to 2012 that\nproduced vapor condensates as the dominant impact product. Two distinct\nshort-term modulations in the ID8 system argue for two violent impacts at\ndifferent times and locations. Its long-term variation is consistent with the\ncollisional evolution of two different populations of impact-produced debris\ndominated by either vapor condensates or escaping boulders. The bright,\nvariable emission from the dust produced in large impacts from extreme debris\ndisks provides a unique opportunity to study violent events during the era of\nterrestrial planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 23:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 22:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

Under the general convex-concave\nassumption, most first-order methods only guarantee an ergodic convergence\nrate, that is, the uniform averages of the iterates converge at a $O(1/T)$ rate\nin terms of the saddle-point residual. However, numerically, the iterates\nthemselves can often converge much faster than the uniform averages. This\nobservation motivates increasing averaging schemes that put more weight on\nlater iterates, in contrast to the usual uniform averaging. We show that such\nincreasing averaging schemes, applied to various first-order methods, are able\nto preserve the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate with no additional assumptions or\ncomputational overhead. Extensive numerical experiments on zero-sum game\nsolving, market equilibrium computation and image denoising demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed schemes. In particular, the increasing averages\nconsistently outperform the uniform averages in all test problems by orders of\nmagnitude. When solving matrix and extensive-form games, increasing averages\nconsistently outperform the last iterates as well. For matrix games, a\nfirst-order method equipped with increasing averaging outperforms the highly\ncompetitive CFR$^+$ algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 01:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 02:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 18:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

While program transformations can mitigate some Spectre attacks, more\nadvanced attacks can divert control flow speculatively to bypass these\nprotective instructions, rendering existing defenses useless.\n  In this paper, we present Venkman: a system that employs program\ntransformation to completely thwart Spectre attacks that poison entries in the\nBranch Target Buffer (BTB) and the Return Stack Buffer (RSB). Venkman\ntransforms code so that all valid targets of a control-flow transfer have an\nidentical alignment in the virtual address space; it further transforms all\nbranches to ensure that all entries added to the BTB and RSB are properly\naligned. By transforming all code this way, Venkman ensures that, in any\nprogram wanting Spectre defenses, all control-flow transfers, including\nspeculative ones, do not skip over protective instructions Venkman adds to the\ncode segment to mitigate Spectre attacks. Unlike existing defenses, Venkman\ndoes not reduce sharing of the BTB and RSB and does not flush these structures,\nallowing safe sharing and reuse among programs while maintaining strong\nprotection against Spectre attacks. We built a prototype of Venkman on an IBM\nPOWER8 machine. Our evaluation on the SPEC benchmarks and selected applications\nshows that Venkman increases execution time to 3.47$\\times$ on average and\nincreases code size to 1.94$\\times$ on average when it is used to ensure that\nfences are executed to mitigate Spectre attacks.

Despite this, we notice that the semantic ambiguity greatly degrades\nthe detection performance. Specifically, the semantic ambiguity means that some\nlandmarks (e.g. those evenly distributed along the face contour) do not have\nclear and accurate definition, causing inconsistent annotations by annotators.\nAccordingly, these inconsistent annotations, which are usually provided by\npublic databases, commonly work as the ground-truth to supervise network\ntraining, leading to the degraded accuracy. To our knowledge, little research\nhas investigated this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic\nmodel which introduces a latent variable, i.e. the 'real' ground-truth which is\nsemantically consistent, to optimize. This framework couples two parts (1)\ntraining landmark detection CNN and (2) searching the 'real' ground-truth.\nThese two parts are alternatively optimized: the searched 'real' ground-truth\nsupervises the CNN training; and the trained CNN assists the searching of\n'real' ground-truth.

In the\nsecond stage the forecasting model is trained, taking into consideration point\nforecast features, as well as selected feature subsets. During the testing\nperiod of the forecast model, the final probabilistic load forecast results are\nleveraged to obtain both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting.\nNumerical results obtained from ISO New England demand data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in the hour-ahead load forecasting,\nwhich uses the gradient boosting regression for the point forecasting and\nquantile regression neural networks for the probabilistic forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 05:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The VMC calculation is accurate for determining the equilibrium\ndistance and the qualitative shape of the experimental PES. Remarkably, after\nthe application of the LRDMC projection to this single determinant ansatz,\nnamely the Jastrow Antisymmetrized Geminal Product (JAGP), chemical accuracy (~\n1kcal/mol) is reached, and the obtained dissociation energy, equilibrium\ninternuclear distance, and harmonic vibrational frequency are in very good\nagreement with the experimental ones. This outcome crucially depends on the\nquality of the optimization used to determine the best possible trial function\nwithin the chosen ansatz. The strategy adopted in this work is to minimize the\nvariational energy by initializing the trial function with the DFT single\ndeterminant ansatz expanded exactly in the same atomic basis used for the\ncorresponding VMC and LRDMC calculations. This atomic basis is ad-hoc reshaped\nfor QMC calculations. Indeed, we multiply the standard Gaussian type atomic\norbitals by a one-body Jastrow factor, satisfying in this way the electron-ion\ncusp conditions. This allows us to use a very small basis almost converged in\nthe complete basis set limit, by reducing the computational effort as well as\nthe statistical fluctuations on the total energy. In order to achieve these\nimportant advantages, we have defined a very efficient DFT algorithm in the\nmentioned basis, by estimating the corresponding matrix elements on a mesh, and\nby using a much finer mesh grid in the vicinity of nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Towards the multimessenger era, the scientific demand for\nsimultaneous observations with different facilities is continuously increasing.\nThe main challenges of coordinating observations is the determination of common\nvisibility and respective scheduling constraints to find common free slots.\nWhile all this information is publicly available via the respective observatory\nweb pages, it is cumbersome to find this information from a large diversity of\nweb interfaces and web tables. Aims. Coordinated observations have been planned\nalready, but their number will continue to increase, and the larger complexity\nrequires much better use of automatic routines. Methods. Automatic tools are\nnot able to obtain visibility and planning information from web interfaces.\nStandard interfaces between observatories need to be developed to use automatic\ntools. We present two Virtual Observatory (VO) protocols ObjVisSAP and\nObsLocTAP that work with a URL-based query approach with standardized query\nparameters and standardized output. Clients can pull the required information\ndirectly from the respective observatories and compute overlapping, unplanned,\nvisibility intervals. Many other use cases are possible. Results. A prototype\nservice has been implemented by the INTEGRAL mission and a very simple client\nscript queries visibility intervals for given coordinates within the next 30\ndays. An observer can quickly see whether a source is observable within the\nnear future. Other missions are on their way to implement the services.\nConclusions. Once the major observatories have implemented the services and\npowerful tools are available that rely on getting visibility and planning\nobservations via these protocols, we expect many other, also ground-based,\nobservatories to follow.

In\nparticular, the quantum path difference between the long and short trajectories\nof electron excursion causes the HHG yield to experience interference-based\ntemporal and spectral modulations. In solids, due to additional phenomena such\nas multi-band superposition and crystal symmetry dependency, the HHG mechanism\nappears to be more complicated than in gaseous atoms in identifying\naccompanying interference phenomena. Here, we first report experimental data\nshowing intensity-dependent spectral modulation and broadening of high\nharmonics observed from bulk sapphire. Then, by adopting theoretical\nsimulation, the extraordinary observation is interpreted as a result of the\nquantum path interference between the long and short electron/hole\ntrajectories. Specifically, the long trajectory undergoes an\nintensity-dependent redshift, which coherently combines with the short\ntrajectory to exhibit spectral splitting in an anomalous way of inverse\nproportion to the driving laser intensity. This quantum interference may be\nextended to higher harmonics with increasing the laser intensity, underpinning\nthe potential for precise control of the phase matching and modulation even in\nthe extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray regime. Further, this approach may act\nas a novel tool for probing arbitrary crystals so as to adjust the electron\ndynamics of higher harmonics for attosecond spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 09:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

For a given image tile sampled from multi-resolution\ngiga-pixel whole slide image (WSI), the model learns to sequentially identify\nsome of the diagnostically relevant regions of interest (ROIs) by following a\nparameterized policy.

We show that there is a class of\nspacetime curvature singularities which can be resolved with metric and matter\nfield transformations. As an example, we consider an anisotropic power-law\ninflation model with scalar and gauge fields in which a space-like curvature\nsingularity exists at the beginning of time. First, we provide a transformation\nof the metric to the flat geometry, i.e. the Minkowski metric. The\ntransformation removes the curvature singularity located at the origin of the\ntime. An essential difference from previous work in the literature is that the\norigin of time is not sent to past infinity by the transformation but it\nremains at a finite time in the past.

Micro-expressions are an invaluable source of\ninformation in application domains such as lie detection, mental health,\nsentiment analysis and more. One of the biggest challenges in this field of\nresearch is the small amount of available spontaneous micro-expression data.\nHowever, spontaneous data collection is burdened by time-consuming and\nexpensive annotation. Hence, methods are needed which can reduce the amount of\ndata that annotators have to review. This paper presents a novel\nmicro-expression spotting method using a recurrent neural network (RNN) on\noptical flow features. We extract Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF)\nfeatures to encode the temporal changes in selected face regions. Finally, the\nRNN spots short intervals which are likely to contain occurrences of relevant\nfacial micro-movements. The proposed method is evaluated on the SAMM database.\nAny chance of subject bias is eliminated by training the RNN using\nLeave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation. Comparing the spotted intervals with\nthe labeled data shows that the method produced 1569 false positives while\nobtaining a recall of 0.4654. The initial results show that the proposed method\nwould reduce the video length by a factor of 3.5, while still retaining almost\nhalf of the relevant micro-movements. Lastly, as the model gets more data, it\nbecomes better at detecting intervals, which makes the proposed method suitable\nfor supporting the annotation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 10:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Excess absorption of neutral hydrogen has been observed in the\nLy$\\alpha$ line during transits of several close-in exoplanets, indicating such\nextended atmospheres. For the hot Jupiter HD 189733b, this absorption shows\ntemporal variability. Variations in stellar XUV emission and/or stellar wind\nconditions have been invoked to explain this effect. We apply a 1D hydrodynamic\nupper atmosphere model and a 3D MHD stellar wind flow model to study the effect\nof variations of the stellar XUV and wind conditions on the neutral hydrogen\ndistribution, including the production of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), and\nthe related Ly$\\alpha$ transit signature. We obtain comparable, albeit slightly\nhigher Ly$\\alpha$ absorption as observed in 2011 with a stellar XUV flux of\n$1.8\\times10^4$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, rather typical activity conditions for\nthis star. Flares similar to the one observed 8 h before the transit are\nunlikely to have caused a significant modulation of the transit signature. The\nresulting Ly$\\alpha$ absorption is dominated by atmospheric broadening, whereas\nthe contribution of ENAs is negligible, as they are formed inside the bow shock\nfrom decelerated wind ions that are heated to high temperatures. Thus, within\nour modeling framework and assumptions, we find an insignificant dependence on\nthe stellar wind parameters. Since the transit absorption can be modeled with\ntypical stellar XUV and wind conditions, it is possible that the non-detection\nof the absorption in 2010 was affected by less typical stellar activity\nconditions, such as a very different magnitude and/or shape of the star's\nspectral XUV emission, or temporal/spatial variations in Ly$\\alpha$ affecting\nthe determination of the transit absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 10:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 18:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 09:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Dwarf starburst\ngalaxies are efficient at forming young massive clusters with similar masses as\nglobular clusters and may hold the key to understanding their formation. We\nstudy star cluster formation in a tidal debris - including the vicinity of\nthree tidal dwarf galaxies - in a massive gas dominated collisional ring around\nNGC~5291. These dwarfs have physical parameters which differ significantly from\nlocal starbursting dwarfs. They are gas-rich, highly turbulent, have a gas\nmetallicity already enriched up to half-solar, and are expected to be free of\ndark matter. The aim is to study massive star cluster formation in this as yet\nunexplored type of environment. We use imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope\nusing broadband filters covering the wavelength range from the near-ultraviolet\nto the near-infrared. We determine the masses and ages of the cluster\ncandidates by using the spectral energy distribution-fitting code CIGALE,\ncarefully considering age-extinction degeneracy effects on the estimation of\nthe physical parameters. We find that the tidal dwarf galaxies in the ring of\nNGC 5291 are forming star clusters with an average efficiency of $\\sim40\\%$,\ncomparable to blue compact dwarf galaxies. We also find massive star clusters\nfor which the photometry suggests that they were formed at the very birth of\nthe tidal dwarf galaxies and have survived for several hundred million years.\nTherefore our study shows that extended tidal dwarf galaxies and compact\nclusters may be formed simultaneously. In the specific case observed here, the\nyoung star clusters are not massive enough to survive for a Hubble time.\nHowever one may speculate that similar objects at higher redshift, with higher\nstar formation rate, might form some of the long lived globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 10:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 13:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

While the Fisher-KPP equation and its generalisations are\ncommonplace, a significant drawback for this family of models is that they are\nnot able to capture the moving fronts that arise in cell invasion applications\nsuch as wound healing and tumour growth. An alternative, less common, approach\nis to include nonlinear degenerate diffusion in the models, such as in the\nPorous-Fisher equation, since solutions to the corresponding equations have\ncompact support and therefore explicitly allow for moving fronts. We consider\nhere a hole-closing problem for the Porous-Fisher equation whereby there is\ninitially a simply connected region (the hole) with a nonzero population\noutside of the hole and a zero population inside. We outline how self-similar\nsolutions (of the second kind) describe both circular and non-circular fronts\nin the hole-closing limit. Further, we present new experimental and theoretical\nevidence to support the use of nonlinear degenerate diffusion in models for\ncollective cell motion. Our methodology involves setting up a 2D wound healing\nassay that has the geometry of a hole-closing problem, with cells initially\nseeded outside of a hole that closes as cells migrate and proliferate. For a\nparticular class of fibroblast cells, the aspect ratio of an initially\nrectangular wound increases in time, so the wound becomes longer and thinner as\nit closes; our theoretical analysis shows that this behaviour is consistent\nwith nonlinear degenerate diffusion but is not able to be captured with\ncommonly used linear diffusion.

In recent\nyears, Conditional Variational Auto Encoders (CVAE) have shown promising\nperformances for this task. However, they often encounter the so called\nKL-Vanishing problem. Previous works mitigated such problem by heuristic\nmethods such as strengthening the encoder or weakening the decoder while\noptimizing the CVAE objective function. Nevertheless, the optimizing direction\nof these methods are implicit and it is hard to find an appropriate degree to\nwhich these methods should be applied. In this paper, we propose an explicit\noptimizing objective to complement the CVAE to directly pull away from\nKL-vanishing. In fact, this objective term guides the encoder towards the \"best\nencoder\" of the decoder to enhance the expressiveness. A labeling network is\nintroduced to estimate the \"best encoder\". It provides a continuous label in\nthe latent space of CVAE to help build a close connection between latent\nvariables and targets. The whole proposed method is named Self Labeling\nCVAE~(SLCVAE). To accelerate the research of diverse text generation, we also\npropose a large native one-to-many dataset.

However, due to large\nindividual differences and varying electrocardiogram signal quality, there does\nnot exist a single reliable estimation algorithm that works well on all\nsubjects. Every algorithm may break down on certain subjects, resulting in a\nsignificant estimation error. Ensemble regression, which aggregates the outputs\nof multiple base estimators for more reliable and stable estimates, can be used\nto remedy this problem. Moreover, active learning can be used to optimally\nselect a few trials from a new subject to label, based on which a stacking\nensemble regression model can be trained to aggregate the base estimators. This\npaper proposes four active stacking approaches, and demonstrates that they all\nsignificantly outperform three common unsupervised ensemble regression\napproaches, and a supervised stacking approach which randomly selects some\ntrials to label. Remarkably, our active stacking approaches only need three or\nfour labeled trials from each subject to achieve an average root mean squared\nestimation error below three beats per minute, making them very convenient for\nreal-world applications. To our knowledge, this is the first research on active\nstacking, and its application to heart rate estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The possibility of observing a\ncompact-object EMRI at the Galactic Centre (GC) when LISA is taking data is\nvery low. However, the capture of a brown dwarf, an X-MRI, is more frequent\nbecause these objects are much more abundant and can plunge without being\ntidally disrupted. An X-MRI covers some $\\sim 10^8$ cycles before merger, and\nhence stay on band for millions of years. About $2\\times 10^6$ yrs before\nmerger they have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the GC of 10. Later, $10^4$\nyrs before merger, the SNR is of several thousands, and $10^3$ yrs before the\nmerger a few $10^4$. Based on these values, this kind of EMRIs are also\ndetectable at neighbour MBHs, albeit with fainter SNRs. We calculate the event\nrate of X-MRIs at the GC taking into account the asymmetry of pro- and\nretrograde orbits on the location of the last stable orbit. We estimate that at\nany given moment, and using a conservative approach, there are of the order of\n$\\gtrsim\\,20$ sources in band. From these, $\\gtrsim\\,5$ are circular and are\nlocated at higher frequencies, and about $\\gtrsim\\,15$ are highly eccentric and\nare at lower frequencies. Due to their proximity, X-MRIs represent a unique\nprobe of gravity in the strong regime. The mass ratio for a X-MRI at the GC is\n$q \\sim 10^8$, i.e., three orders of magnitude larger than stellar-mass black\nhole EMRIs. Since backreaction depends on $q$, the orbit follows closer a\nstandard geodesic, which means that approximations work better in the\ncalculation of the orbit. X-MRIs can be sufficiently loud so as to track the\nsystematic growth of their SNR, which can be high enough to bury that of MBH\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:32:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 02:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The rollover data plan, which allows the unused data of the previous month\nto be used in the current month, provides the subscribers with the time\nflexibility. In this paper, we formulate two MNOs' market competition as a\nthree-stage game, where the MNOs decide their data mechanisms (traditional or\nrollover) in Stage I and the pricing strategies in Stage II, and then users\nmake their subscription decisions in Stage III. Different from the monopoly\nmarket where an MNO always prefers the rollover mechanism over the traditional\nplan in terms of profit, MNOs may adopt different data mechanisms at an\nequilibrium. Specifically, the high-QoS MNO would gradually abandon the\nrollover mechanism as its QoS advantage diminishes. Meanwhile, the low-QoS MNO\nwould progressively upgrade to the rollover mechanism. The numerical results\nshow that the market competition significantly limits MNOs' profits, but both\nMNOs obtain higher profits with the possible choice of the rollover data plan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Many of the NSCs\nco-habit with super-massive black holes and follow similar scaling relations\nwith host galaxy properties. NSCs, unlike black holes, preserve the signature\nof their evolutionary path imprinted onto their kinematics and stellar\npopulations. Thus their study provides us with important information about the\nformation of galactic nuclei. In this paper we explored the angular momentum of\nthe nuclei of six intermediate mass (9.7 > log(Mdyn/M_sun) > 10.6) early-type\ngalaxies in the Fornax cluster that host NSCs. Our goal was to derive a link\nbetween the nuclear angular momentum and the proposed formation scenarios of\nNSCs. We used Adaptive Optics assisted IFU observations with VLT/SINFONI to\nderive the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the galaxy nuclei. We\nmeasured their specific stellar angular momenta ($\\lambda_\\mathrm{Re}$), and\ncompared these with Milky Way globular clusters and N-body simulations of NSC\nformation.

Five out of six galaxy nuclei are consistent with\nthe $\\lambda_\\mathrm{Re} - \\epsilon_\\mathrm{e}$ of simulated NSCs embedded in a\ncontaminating nuclear bulge that have formed via the in-spiralling and merging\nof GCs. It has previously been suggested that the NSCs in higher mass galaxies,\nlike the ones studied in this paper, form via dissipational sinking of gas onto\nthe galactic nuclei with hints that some might also involve the merger of GCs.\nHere we showed that we cannot exclude the pure GC merging scenario as a viable\npath for the formation of NSCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 14:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The GRAVITY instrument on the ESO VLTI is setting a new mark in the\nlandscape of optical interferometers.

Modern interferometers, especially those that combine light collected\nby large telescopes such as the Unit Telescopes of the VLT, benefit from\npartial correction of atmospheric turbulence. We investigate in this paper the\ninfluence of atmospheric turbulence on the maximum field of view of\ninterferometers such as GRAVITY, where wavefronts are filtered with single-mode\nfibres. The basic question is whether the maximum field of view is restricted\nto the diffraction limit of single apertures or if it is wider in practice.

First, we\nassessed the contributions of Gq, G12/13, Gi, Gbg, ERK1/2 and \\b{eta}-\narrestins pathways in the cellular responses measured by SPR where Gq,\nG12/Rho/ROCK together with \\b{eta}-arrestins and ERK1/2 were found to play\nsignificant roles. More specifically, we established a major role for G12 in\nthe early events of the AT1R-dependent response, which was followed by a robust\nERK1/2 component associated to the later phase of the signal. Interestingly,\nendogenous AT1R ligands (AngII, AngIII and AngIV) exhibited distinct responses\nsignatures with a significant increase of the ERK1/2-like components for both\nAngIII and AngIV, which points toward possibly distinct physiological roles for\nthe later. We also tested AT1R biased ligands, all of which affected both the\nearly and later events. Our results support SPR-based integrative cellular\nassays as a powerful approach to delineate the contribution of specific\nsignaling pathways for a given cell response and reveal response differences\nassociated with ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Functional\nselectivity (also called biased signaling), where specific compounds can bring\nGPCRs to adopt conformations that enable selective receptor coupling to\ndistinct signaling pathways, continues to be significantly investigated.\nHowever, an important but often overlooked aspect of functional selectivity is\nthe capability of ligands such as angiotensin II (AngII) to adopt specific\nconformations that may preferentially bind to selective GPCRs structures.\nUnderstanding both receptor and ligand conformation is of the utmost importance\nfor the design of new drugs targeting GPCRs. In this study, we examined the\nproperties of AngII cyclic analogs to impart biased agonism on the angiotensin\ntype 1 receptor (AT1R). Positions 3 and 5 of AngII were substituted for\ncysteine and homocysteine residues ([Sar1Hcy3,5]AngII, [Sar1Cys3Hcy5]AngII and\n[Sar1Cys3,5]AngII) and the resulting analogs were evaluated for their capacity\nto activate the Gq/11, G12, Gi2, Gi3, Gz, ERK and \\b{eta}-arrestin (\\b{eta}arr)\nsignaling pathways via AT1R. Interestingly, [Sar1Hcy3,5]AngII exhibited potency\nand full efficacy on all pathways tested with the exception of the Gq pathway.\nMolecular dynamic simulations showed that the energy barrier associated with\nthe insertion of residue Phe8 of AngII within the hydrophobic core of AT1R,\nassociated with Gq/11 activation, is increased with [Sar1Hcy3,5]AngII. These\nresults suggest that constraining the movements of molecular determinants\nwithin a given ligand by introducing cyclic structures may lead to the\ngeneration of novel ligands providing more efficient biased agonism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We present a new architecture composed of spatially adaptive residual\nlearning modules that implicitly discover the spatially varying shifts\nresponsible for non-uniform blur in the input image and learn to modulate the\nfilters. This capability is complemented by a self-attentive module which\ncaptures non-local relationships among the intermediate features and enhances\nthe receptive field.

There are Hybrid PSO\nresearch articles based on Human Behavior, Human Cognition and Human Thinking\netc. But there are no Hybrid PSO articles which based on concepts like Human\nDisease, Human Kindness and Human Relaxation. This paper proposes new AHO Field\nalgorithms based on these research gaps. Some existing Hybrid PSO algorithms\nare given a new name in this work so that it will be easy for future AHO\nresearchers to find these novel Artificial Human Optimization Field Algorithms.\nA total of 6 Artificial Human Optimization Field algorithms titled \"Human\nSafety Particle Swarm Optimization (HuSaPSO)\", \"Human Kindness Particle Swarm\nOptimization (HKPSO)\", \"Human Relaxation Particle Swarm Optimization (HRPSO)\",\n\"Multiple Strategy Human Particle Swarm Optimization (MSHPSO)\", \"Human Thinking\nParticle Swarm Optimization (HTPSO)\" and \"Human Disease Particle Swarm\nOptimization (HDPSO)\" are tested by applying these novel algorithms on Ackley,\nBeale, Bohachevsky, Booth and Three-Hump Camel Benchmark Functions.

In the case of soft tissue, these models need to be deformed and\nadapted to the current situation by using intra-operative sensor data. A\npromising method to realize this are real-time capable biomechanical models.\n  Methods: We train a fully convolutional neural network to estimate a\ndisplacement field of all points inside an organ when given only the\ndisplacement of a part of the organ's surface. The network trains on entirely\nsynthetic data of random organ-like meshes, which allows us to generate much\nmore data than is otherwise available. The input and output data is discretized\ninto a regular grid, allowing us to fully utilize the capabilities of\nconvolutional operators and to train and infer in a highly parallelized manner.\n  Results: The system is evaluated on in-silico liver models, phantom liver\ndata and human in-vivo breathing data.

Even though\nthe network is only trained on synthetic data, it adapts well to the various\ncases and gives a good estimation of the internal organ displacement.

The accuracy is comparable to other registration\nmethods, it adapts very well to previously unseen organs and does not need to\nbe re-trained for every patient. The high inferring speed makes this method\nuseful for many applications such as surgical navigation and real-time\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

This aspect makes intent\nclassification task more challenging for using state of the art deep learning\nmethods. In this paper, we propose an approach of the questions embeddings\nrepresentation based on calculation of Shannon entropy.The goal of the approach\nis to produce low dimensional question vectors as neural approaches do and to\noutperform related methods, described above in condition of small dataset. We\nevaluate and compare our model with existing ones using logistic regression and\ndataset that contains questions asked by students and enrollees. The data is\nlabeled into six classes. Experimental comparison of proposed approach and\nother models revealed that proposed model performed better in the given task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 18:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

In the proposed approach\nimage segmentation is based on CUSUM filter usage that was adapted to be\napplicable to process DSC perfusion MR images. The result of segmentation is a\nbinary mask of brain ROI that is generated via usage of brain boundary\nlocation. Each point of the boundary between the brain and surrounding tissues\nis detected as a change-point by CUSUM filter. Proposed adopted CUSUM filter\noperates by accumulating the deviations between the observed and expected\nintensities of image points at the time of moving on a trajectory. Motion\ntrajectory is created by the iterative change of movement direction inside the\nbackground region in order to reach brain region, and vice versa after boundary\ncrossing. Proposed segmentation approach was evaluated with Dice index\ncomparing obtained results to the reference standard. Manually marked brain\nregion pixels (reference standard), as well as visual inspection of detected\nwith CUSUM filter usage brain ROI, were provided by experienced radiologists.\nThe results showed that proposed approach is suitable to be used for brain ROI\ndetection from DSC perfusion MR images of a human head with abnormal brain\nanatomy and can, therefore, be applied in the DSC perfusion data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Moreover, it is possible to\nstate that optimization is dominant in commercial development. A problem of a\nnew file system architecture development arises more frequently in academia.\nEnd-user can treat file system performance as the key problem of file system\nevolving as technology. Such understanding arises from common treatment of\npersistent memory as slow subsystem. As a result, problem of improving\nperformance of data processing treats as a problem of file system performance\noptimization. However, evolution of physical technologies of persistent data\nstorage requires significant changing of concepts and approaches of file\nsystems' internal techniques. Generally speaking, only trying to improve the\nfile system efficiency cannot resolve all issue of file systems as\ntechnological direction. Moreover, it can impede evolution of file system\ntechnology at whole. It is impossible to satisfy end-user's expectations by\nmeans of file systems optimization only.
