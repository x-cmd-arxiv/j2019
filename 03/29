The results indicate that planetary CO$_2$ budgets ranging from\n$\\approx 3$ orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to $\\approx 1$ order of\nmagnitude larger, and radiogenic heating budgets as large or larger than\nEarth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1-5 Gyrs. The ability of stagnant\nlid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored;\nrecovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere-ocean chemical exchange is\npossible. For a \"hard\" snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most\nCO$_2$ outgassing takes place via metamorphic decarbonation of the crust, which\noccurs below the ice layer. However, for a \"soft\" snowball where there is\nexchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both\nhard and soft snowball states, there is a minimum CO$_2$ budget needed for\nrecovery; below this limit any snowball state would be permanent. Thus there is\nthe possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate evolution, where\nplanets with low CO$_2$ budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be\npermanently stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start\nwith a temperate climate will be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyrs\nor more.

The price of the leather is subjective\nas it is highly sensitive to its quality and surface defects condition. In the\nliterature, there are very few works investigating on the defects detection for\nleather using automatic image processing techniques. The manual defect\ninspection process is essential in an leather production industry to control\nthe quality of the finished products. However, it is tedious, as it is labour\nintensive, time consuming, causes eye fatigue and often prone to human error.\nIn this paper, a fully automatic defect detection and marking system on a calf\nleather is proposed. The proposed system consists of a piece of leather, LED\nlight, high resolution camera and a robot arm. Succinctly, a machine vision\nmethod is presented to identify the position of the defects on the leather\nusing a deep learning architecture. Then, a series of processes are conducted\nto predict the defect instances, including elicitation of the leather images\nwith a robot arm, train and test the images using a deep learning architecture\nand determination of the boundary of the defects using mathematical derivation\nof the geometry. Note that, all the processes do not involve human\nintervention, except for the defect ground truths construction stage. The\nproposed algorithm is capable to exhibit 91.5% segmentation accuracy on the\ntrain data and 70.35% on the test data. We also report confusion matrix,\nF1-score, precision and specificity, sensitivity performance metrics to further\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

As an important instance of an upper bound, we construct a measure\nof nonlocality called \"squashed nonlocality\". Using this bound, we identify\nnumerically a certain domain of two binary inputs and two binary outputs\nnon-local devices for which the squashed nonlocality is zero. Therefore one can\nnot distill secure-key from these non-local devices via a considered (standard)\nclass of operations. Showing a connection of our approach to [New J. Phys.,\n8:126, 2006] we provide, to our knowledge, the tightest known upper bound in\nthe (3,2,2,2) scenario. Moreover, we formulate a security condition, equivalent\nto known ones, for the considered class of protocols. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a non-signaling norm that constitutes an analogy to the trace norm\nused in the security condition of the quantum key distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 08:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 14:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 12:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 20:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 17:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

However, neither the mechanism of\nits generation nor the influence on the underlying spiking dynamics is well\nunderstood. Here, we investigate the dynamics of two interacting distant\nneuronal modules coupled by inter-regional long-range connections. Each\nneuronal module comprises an excitatory and inhibitory population of quadratic\nintegrate-and-fire neurons connected locally with conductance-based synapses.\nThe two modules are coupled reciprocally with delays that represent the\nlong-range conduction time. We applied the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to reduce the\nspiking dynamics to the corresponding mean field equations as a small set of\ndelay differential equations. Bifurcation analysis on these mean field\nequations shows inter-regional conduction delay is sufficient to produce CFC\nvia a torus bifurcation. Spike correlation analysis during the CFC revealed\nthat several local clusters exhibit synchronized firing in gamma-band\nfrequencies. These clusters exhibit locally decorrelated firings between the\ncluster pairs within the same population. In contrast, the clusters exhibit\nlong-range gamma-band cross-covariance between the distant clusters that have\nsimilar firing frequency. The interactions of the different gamma frequencies\nproduce a beat leading to population-level CFC. We analyzed spike counts in\nrelation to the phases of the macroscopic fast and slow oscillations and found\npopulation spike counts vary with respect to macroscopic phases. Such firing\nphase preference accompanies a phase window with high spike count and low Fano\nfactor, which is suitable for a population rate code. Our work suggests the\ninter-regional conduction delay plays a significant role in the emergence of\nCFC and the underlying spiking dynamics may support long-range communication\nand neural coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

Most existing approaches\nmainly rely on models that estimate the segmentation mask based on a reference\nmask at the first frame (aided sometimes by optical flow or the previous mask).\nThese models, however, are prone to fail under rapid appearance changes or\nocclusions due to their limitations in modelling the temporal component. On the\nother hand, very recently, other approaches learned long-term features using a\nconvolutional LSTM to leverage the information from all previous video frames.\nEven though these models achieve better temporal representations, they still\nhave to be fine-tuned for every new video sequence. In this paper, we present\nan intermediate solution and devise a novel GAN architecture, FaSTGAN, to learn\nspatio-temporal object models over finite temporal windows. To achieve this, we\nconcentrate all the heavy computational load to the training phase with two\ncritics that enforce spatial and temporal mask consistency over the last K\nframes. Then at test time, we only use a relatively light regressor, which\nreduces the inference time considerably.

In this paper we\nconsider the problem of designing spectral approximations to graphs, or\nspectral sparsifiers, using a small number of linear measurements, with the\nadditional constraint that the sketches admit an efficient recovery scheme.\n  Prior to our work, sketching algorithms were known with near optimal $\\tilde\nO(n)$ space complexity, but $\\Omega(n^2)$ time decoding (brute-force over all\npotential edges of the input graph), or with subquadratic time, but rather\nlarge $\\Omega(n^{5/3})$ space complexity (due to their reliance on a rather\nweak relation between connectivity and effective resistances).

In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense\nsliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our\ncore observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense\nprediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object\ndetection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric\nstructure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense\ninstance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a\ngeneral framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and\nenables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view\nleads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to\nresults comparable to Mask R-CNN.

We find that ultra-hot\nJupiters exhibit temperature inversions that are sensitive to the spectral type\nof the host star. The slope and temperature range across the inversion both\nincrease as the host star effective temperature increases due to enhanced\nabsorption at short wavelengths and low pressures.

FRBs have extremely high\nbrightness temperatures, which points to a coherent source of radiation. The\nenergy of a single burst ranges from $10^{36}$ to $10^{39}$ erg. At the high\nend of the energy range, FRBs have enough energy to unbind an earth-sized\nplanet, and even at the low end, there is enough energy to vaporise and unbind\nthe atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of\nan artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or\neven destroy the planet entirely.

We find that the major\nmerger pair fraction rises with redshift to $z\\approx6$ proportional to\n$(1+z)^{m}$, with $m = 0.8\\pm0.2$ ($m = 1.8\\pm0.2$) for $\\log_{10}(\\rm{M}_{*} /\n\\rm{M}_{\\odot}) > 10.3$ ($9.7 < \\log_{10}(\\rm{M}_{*}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot}) < 10.3$).\nInvestigating the pair fraction as a function of mass ratio between 1:20 and\n1:1, we find no evidence for a strong evolution in the relative numbers of\nminor to major mergers out to $z<3$. Using evolving merger timescales we find\nthat the merger rate per galaxy ($\\mathcal{R}$) rises rapidly from $0.07\\pm\n0.01$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z < 1$ to $7.6\\pm 2.7$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z = 6$ for galaxies\nat $\\log_{10}(\\rm{M}_{*}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot}) > 10.3$. The corresponding co-moving\nmajor merger rate density remains roughly constant during this time, with rates\nof $\\Gamma \\approx 10^{-4}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Based on the observed merger\nrates per galaxy, we infer specific mass accretion rates from major mergers\nthat are comparable to the specific star-formation rates for the same mass\ngalaxies at $z>3$ - observational evidence that mergers are as important a\nmechanism for building up mass at high redshift as in-situ star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 18:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

One\nexplanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov\nconfiguration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit\neach other on slightly eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line\nthrough the barycenter perpendicular to the primaries' orbital plane\n(Freistetter & Gr\\\"utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity GCM to\ninclude the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to\ndetermine whether such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic\nvariations observed by the inhabitants of Westeros, in both double-star and\nstar-black hole configurations. While configurations with low primary\neccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the\necliptic plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi\nclimate. We find that while orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce\nrare anomalously long and cold winters similar to Westeros's Long Night, huge\nvariations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales should render\nthese planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital\nmegastructure, either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of\nthe sunlight during crossings of the primaries' orbital plane and preserve\nWesteros's habitability. While we find that bounded chaotic Sitnikov orbits are\na viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic\nvariations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to\ntorques from nearby planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than\nSitnikov orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 18:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

As an example, a shared register named\n$A$ by a process $p$ and a shared register named $B$ by another process $q$ can\ncorrespond to the very same register $X$, and similarly for the names $B$ at\n$p$ and $A$ at $q$ which can correspond to the same register $Y\\neq X$. Hence,\nthere is a permanent disagreement on the register names among the processes.\nThis new notion of anonymity was recently introduced by G. Taubenfeld (PODC\n2017), who presented several memory-anonymous algorithms and impossibility\nresults.\n  This paper introduces a new problem (new to our knowledge), that consists in\n\"desanonymizing\" an anonymous shared memory. To this end, it presents an\nalgorithm that, starting with a shared memory made up of $m$ anonymous\nread/write atomic registers (i.e., there is no a priori agreement on their\nnames), allows each process to compute a local addressing mapping, such that\nall the processes agree on the names of each register.

The leading counting\napproaches start from point annotations per object from which they construct\ndensity maps. Then, their training objective transforms input images to density\nmaps through deep convolutional networks. We posit that the point annotations\nserve more supervision purposes than just constructing density maps. We\nintroduce ways to repurpose the points for free. First, we propose supervised\nfocus from segmentation, where points are converted into binary maps. The\nbinary maps are combined with a network branch and accompanying loss function\nto focus on areas of interest. Second, we propose supervised focus from global\ndensity, where the ratio of point annotations to image pixels is used in\nanother branch to regularize the overall density estimation. To assist both the\ndensity estimation and the focus from segmentation, we also introduce an\nimproved kernel size estimator for the point annotations. Experiments on six\ndatasets show that all our contributions reduce the counting error, regardless\nof the base network, resulting in state-of-the-art accuracy using only a single\nnetwork.

In the relevant parameter regime, the system is slow-fast with\ntwo slow variables and one fast. The oscillation is special for several\nreasons: Firstly, its singular limit is unbounded, the amplitude of the cycle\ngrowing like $\\log \\epsilon^{-1}$ as $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$. As a consequence\nof this estimate, the unboundedness of the cycle cannot be captured by a simple\n$\\epsilon$-dependent scaling of the variables, see e.g. \\cite{Gucwa2009783}. We\ntherefore obtain its limit on the Poincar\\'e sphere. Here we find that the\nsingular limit consists of a slow part on an attracting critical manifold, and\na fast part on the equator (i.e. at $\\infty$) of the Poincar\\'e sphere, which\nincludes motion along a center manifold. The reduced flow on this center\nmanifold runs out along the manifold's boundary, in a special way, leading to a\ncomplex return to the slow manifold. We prove the existence of the limit cycle\nby showing that a return map is a contraction. The main technical difficulty in\nthis part is due to the fact that the critical manifold loses hyperbolicity at\nan exponential rate at infinity. We therefore use the method in\n\\cite{kristiansen2017a}, applying the standard blowup technique in an extended\nphase space.

They can align themselves according to the direction of propulsion\nof their neighbours, together with a random perturbation (i.e. rotational\nfluctuation). They are also interacting with each other by a soft, isotropic,\nexcluded-volume interaction. Particles are confined in a circular trap. The\nsteepness of the trap is tuneable. Their average packing fraction and strength\nof rotational fluctuation are low. When the trap is steep, particles flock\nalong its boundary. They form polar cluster that spreads over the boundary. The\ncluster has no spatial or structural order. We show, when the steepness is\ndecreased beyond a threshold value, the clusters become round, compact and\neventually spatial order (hexagonal) emerges in addition to the pre-established\npolar order within them. We investigate kinetics of such ordering. We find that\nwhile rotating around the centre of the trap along its circular boundary, the\nclusters need to roll around their centre of mass, to be spatially ordered.

The decoupling of different wavelength\nmodes in free field theory prevents true thermalisation but a more subtle\ndifference is that the density operator obtained by a partial trace does not\ncommute with the post-quench Hamiltonian. Generalized thermal behaviour is\nobtained at late times, in the limit of weak initial mixing or a smooth but\nrapid quench.

Here we\nshow that this scattering is altered when the twisted neutrons, recently\nobtained experimentally, are used instead -- that is, neutrons with an orbital\nangular momentum. For bulk targets, the angular distributions of the scattered\nneutrons get modified, while scattering of a superposition of states with the\ndifferent angular momenta also reveals dependence on the longitudinal\npolarization. For well-localized targets, the observables develop a dependence\non the neutron's {\\it helicity} and on {\\it a real part} of the nuclear\namplitude, providing full access to its phase already in the Born\napproximation. We argue that the corresponding spin asymmetries are measurable\nat existing neutron facilities. Thus, scattering of the twisted neutrons by\nnuclei can provide means for quantum tomography of the neutron states and\nbecome a useful tool for hadronic studies, low-energy nuclear physics, tests of\nfundamental symmetries, and neutron optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 20:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 20:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

A\npopular alternative is to indirectly obtain the source information through the\nElectroglottographic (EGG) signal that measures the electrical admittance\naround the vocal folds using dedicated hardware. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of estimating the EGG signal directly from the speech signal, devoid of\nany hardware. Sampling from the intractable conditional distribution of the EGG\nsignal given the speech signal is accomplished through optimization of an\nevidence lower bound. This is constructed via minimization of the KL-divergence\nbetween the true and the approximated posteriors of a latent variable learned\nusing a deep neural auto-encoder that serves an informative prior. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the method at generating the EGG signal by\nconducting several experiments on datasets comprising multiple speakers, voice\nqualities, noise settings and speech pathologies. The proposed method is\nevaluated on many benchmark metrics and is found to agree with the gold\nstandard while proving better than the state-of-the-art algorithms on a few\ntasks such as epoch extraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 20:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 20:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

The most\nwidely investigated security concern of DNN is from its malicious input, a.k.a\nadversarial example. Nevertheless, the security challenge of DNN's parameters\nis not well explored yet. In this work, we are the first to propose a novel DNN\nweight attack methodology called Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) which can crush a neural\nnetwork through maliciously flipping extremely small amount of bits within its\nweight storage memory system (i.e., DRAM). The bit-flip operations could be\nconducted through well-known Row-Hammer attack, while our main contribution is\nto develop an algorithm to identify the most vulnerable bits of DNN weight\nparameters (stored in memory as binary bits), that could maximize the accuracy\ndegradation with a minimum number of bit-flips.

The general aim of the present paper is to perform a comparative\nanalysis of type III solar and narrow-band type-III-like radio burst properties\nbefore and during CME events, respectively. The main goal is to analyze radio\nobservational signatures of the dynamical processes in solar corona. In\nparticular, we aim to perform a comparison of local plasma parameters without\nand with CME propagation, based on the analysis of decameter radio emission\ndata. We performed a comparison of usual type III bursts before the CME with\nnarrow-band type-III-like bursts, which are observationally detectable on top\nof the background type IV radio bursts associated with CME propagation. We\nfocused on the analysis of in total 429 type III and 129 narrow-band\ntype-III-like bursts. We studied their main characteristic parameters such as\nfrequency drift rate, duration, and instantaneous frequency bandwidth using\nstandard statistical methods. Furthermore, we inferred local plasma parameters\nusing known definitions of frequency drift, duration, and instantaneous\nfrequency bandwidth.The analysis reveals that the physical parameters of\ncoronal plasma before CMEs considerably differ from those during the\npropagation of CMEs (the observational periods 2 and 4 with type IV radio\nbursts associated with CMEs). Local density radial profiles and the\ncharacteristic spatial scales of radio emission sources vary with radial\ndistance more drastically during the CME propagation compared to the cases of\nquasistatic solar atmosphere without CME(s) (observational periods 1 and 3).\nThe results of the work enable us to distinguish different regimes of plasma\nstate in the solar corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 21:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

We\nfind that regardless of the environmental definition adopted, the fraction of\nblue/star-forming galaxies is the highest in the field/least dense regions and\nthe lowest in the virial regions of clusters/highest densities. Furthermore,\nthe fraction of star-forming galaxies is higher than the fraction of blue\ngalaxies, regardless of the environment. This result is particularly evident in\nthe virial cluster regions, most likely reflecting the different star formation\nhistories of galaxies in different environments.

Patients\ntherefore follow a \"regimen\" that determines how much insulin to inject at\ncertain times. Current methods for managing this disease require adjusting the\npatient's regimen over time based on the disease's behavior (recorded in the\npatient's diabetes diary). If we can accurately predict a patient's future BG\nvalues from his/her current features (e.g., predicting today's lunch BG value\ngiven today's diabetes diary entry for breakfast, including insulin injections,\nand perhaps earlier entries), then it is relatively easy to produce an\neffective regimen.

The controller includes two components: the\nregular Q-learning controller that controls the traffic light signal, and the\nadaptive controller that continuously optimizes the action space for the\nQ-learning algorithm in order to improve the efficiency of the Q-learning\nalgorithm. The regular Q-learning controller uses the control cost function as\na reward function to determine the action to choose.

The goal is to predict the spatial\nlocation of a ground-level query image by matching it to a large geotagged\naerial image database (e.g., satellite imagery). This is a challenging task due\nto the drastic differences in their viewpoints and visual appearances. Existing\ndeep learning methods for this problem have been focused on maximizing feature\nsimilarity between spatially close-by image pairs, while minimizing other\nimages pairs which are far apart. They do so by deep feature embedding based on\nvisual appearance in those ground-and-aerial images. However, in everyday life,\nhumans commonly use {\\em orientation} information as an important cue for the\ntask of spatial localization. Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a\nnovel method which endows deep neural networks with the `commonsense' of\norientation.

Our attention is\nrestricted to the family of unnormalized probability densities for which the\nnegative log density (or energy function) is a ConvNet. We find that many of\nthe techniques used to stabilize training in previous studies are not\nnecessary. ML learning with a ConvNet potential requires only a few\nhyper-parameters and no regularization. Using this minimal framework, we\nidentify a variety of ML learning outcomes that depend solely on the\nimplementation of MCMC sampling.\n  On one hand, we show that it is easy to train an energy-based model which can\nsample realistic images with short-run Langevin. ML can be effective and stable\neven when MCMC samples have much higher energy than true steady-state samples\nthroughout training. Based on this insight, we introduce an ML method with\npurely noise-initialized MCMC, high-quality short-run synthesis, and the same\nbudget as ML with informative MCMC initialization such as CD or PCD. Unlike\nprevious models, our energy model can obtain realistic high-diversity samples\nfrom a noise signal after training.\n  On the other hand, ConvNet potentials learned with non-convergent MCMC do not\nhave a valid steady-state and cannot be considered approximate unnormalized\ndensities of the training data because long-run MCMC samples differ greatly\nfrom observed images. We show that it is much harder to train a ConvNet\npotential to learn a steady-state over realistic images. To our knowledge,\nlong-run MCMC samples of all previous models lose the realism of short-run\nsamples.

The results show that the\nhigher recommendation accuracy based on diffusion algorithms can still be\nachieved by optimizing the way of resource allocation on a density network. On\na sparse network, the possibility of improving accuracy is relatively low due\nto the fact that the current accuracy of diffusion-based methods is very close\nits predictability.

While gravitational energy, B field, and turbulent pressure all grow\nsystematically from large to small scale, the ratios among the three\nconstituents develop clearly differently over scale. We propose that this\nvarying relative importance between B field, gravity, and turbulence over scale\ndrives and explains the different fragmentation types seen at sub-pc scale (no\nfragmentation in MM1; aligned fragmentation in MM2; clustered fragmentation in\nMM3). We discuss uncertainties, subtleties, and the robustness of our\nconclusion, and we stress the need of a multi-scale joint analysis to\nunderstand the dynamics in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 08:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

To retrieve a generative mechanism to sample new data, we introduce an\nex-post density estimation step that can be readily applied also to existing\nVAEs, improving their sample quality. We show, in a rigorous empirical study,\nthat the proposed regularized deterministic autoencoders are able to generate\nsamples that are comparable to, or better than, those of VAEs and more powerful\nalternatives when applied to images as well as to structured data such as\nmolecules. \\footnote{An implementation is available at:\n\\url{https://github.com/ParthaEth/Regularized_autoencoders-RAE-}}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 10:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 13:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 22:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 09:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

To reduce the high cost and power consumption of a fully digital\nmmWave precoder and combiner, hybrid analog/digital designs based on analog\nphase shifters are often adopted. In this work we derive an iterative algorithm\nfor the hybrid precoding and combining design for spatial multiplexing in\nmmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To cope with the\ndifficulty of handling the hardware constraint imposed by the analog phase\nshifters we use the alternating direction method of the multipliers (ADMM) to\nsplit the hybrid design problem into a sequence of smaller subproblems. This\nresults in an iterative algorithm where the design of the analog\nprecoder/combiner consists of a closed form solution followed by a simple\nprojection over the set of matrices with equal magnitude elements. It is\ninitially developed for the fully-connected structure and then extended to the\npartially-connected architecture which allows simpler hardware implementation.\nFurthermore, to cope with the more likely wideband scenarios where the channel\nis frequency selective, we also extend the algorithm to an orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) based mmWave system. Simulation results in\ndifferent scenarios show that the proposed design algorithms are capable of\nachieving performances close to the optimal fully digital solution and can work\nwith a broad range of configuration of antennas, RF chains and data streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 10:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

The Nambu-Goldstone Green\nfunction $D(\\omega,{\\bf q})$ has the form $1/(gN(0))^2\\cdot\n(2\\Delta)^2/(\\omega^2-c_s^2{\\bf q}^2)$ with the coupling constant $g$ and\n$c_s=v_F/\\sqrt{3}$ for small $\\omega$ and ${\\bf q}$, with a pole at $\\omega=0$\nand ${\\bf q}=0$ indicating the existence of a massless mode.

An accurate and attractive description\nnot only helps customers make an informed decision but also improves the\nlikelihood of purchase. However, crafting a successful product description is\ntedious and highly time-consuming. Due to its importance, automating the\nproduct description generation has attracted considerable interests from both\nresearch and industrial communities. Existing methods mainly use templates or\nstatistical methods, and their performance could be rather limited. In this\npaper, we explore a new way to generate the personalized product description by\ncombining the power of neural networks and knowledge base. Specifically, we\npropose a KnOwledge Based pErsonalized (or KOBE) product description generation\nmodel in the context of e-commerce. In KOBE, we extend the encoder-decoder\nframework, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation using\nself-attention. In order to make the description both informative and\npersonalized, KOBE considers a variety of important factors during text\ngeneration, including product aspects, user categories, and knowledge base,\netc. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nout-performs the baseline on various metrics. KOBE can achieve an improvement\nof 9.7% over state-of-the-arts in terms of BLEU. We also present several case\nstudies as the anecdotal evidence to further prove the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.

Neuromodulation by electrical stimulation of the human cervical\nvagus nerve may be limited by adverse side effects due to stimulation of\noff-target organs.

Preliminary studies have shown this is\npossible using a cylindrical multielectrode human-sized nerve cuff in vagus\nnerve selective neuromodulation. New method. The model-based optimisation\nmethod for multi-electrode geometric design is presented. The method was\napplied for vagus nerve cuff array and suggested two rings of 14 electrodes, 3\nmm apart, with 0.4 mm electrode width and separation and length 0.5-3 mm, with\nstimulation through a pair in the same radial position on the two rings. The\nelectrodes were fabricated using PDMS-embedded stainless steel foil and PEDOT:\npTS coating. Results.

This mode coupling is coalescence of two modes with\nnearly equal phase velocities: the first mode is inertial wave having positive\nenergy, while the second mode is a settling dust wave (SDW) having negative\nenergy as measured in the frame of gas environment being at rest in vertical\nhydrostatic equilibrium. SDW is a trivial mode produced by the bulk settling of\ndust, which transports perturbations of dust density. The phase velocity of SDW\nis equal to the bulk settling velocity times the cosine of the angle formed by\nthe wave vector and the rotation axis. In this way, the bulk settling of dust\nmakes possible the coupling of SDW with the inertial wave and the onset of the\ninstability. In accordance with the concept of the mode coupling, the\ninstability growth rate is proportional to the square root of the dispersion\nequation coupling term, which itself contains the small mass fraction of dust\nin gas-dust mixture, the squared radial wavenumber of the modes, and the\nsquared bulk settling velocity.

Through experimental voltage\nunderscaling studies on commercial FPGAs, we observed that the rate of these\nfaults exponentially increases for on-chip memories, or Block RAMs (BRAMs).

In\nthis abstract we will study the following question: given a continuous\nassignment of mass distributions to certain subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^d$, is there\na subset on which we can bisect more masses than what is guaranteed by the\nHam-Sandwich theorem?\n  We investigate two types of subsets.

Two of the most\npopular innovative data plans are rollover and shared data plans, where the\nformer plan allows a user to keep his unused data quota to next month and the\nlatter plan allows users in a family to share unused data. As a pioneer to\nprovide such data plans, a WSP faces immediate revenue loss from existing users\nwho pay less overage charges due to less data over-usage, but his market share\nincreases gradually by attracting new users and those under the other WSPs. In\nsome countries, WSPs have asymmetric timing for providing such innovative data\nplans, while some other markets' WSPs have symmetric timing or no planning.\nThis raises the question of why and when the competitive WSPs should offer the\nnew data plans. This paper provides game theoretic modelling and analysis of\nthe WSPs' timing of offering innovative data plans, by considering new user\narrival and dynamic user churn between WSPs. Our equilibrium analysis shows\nthat the WSP with small market share prefers to announce the innovative data\nplan first to attract more users, while the WSP with large market share prefers\nto announce later to avoid the immediate revenue loss. In a market with many\nnew users, WSPs with similar market shares will offer the data plans\nsimultaneously, but these WSPs facing few new users may not offer any new plan.\nPerhaps surprisingly, WSPs' profits can decrease with new user number and they\nmay not benefit from the option of innovative data plans. Finally, unlike\nrollover data plan, we show that the timing of shared data plan further depends\non the composition of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 08:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

Because the players\nchoose sequentially, the second mover has the advantage. In fact, for any\nthree-flip pattern, there is another three-flip pattern that is strictly more\nlikely to occur first. This paper provides a novel no-arbitrage argument that\ngenerates the winning odds corresponding to any pair of distinct patterns. The\nresulting odds formula is equivalent to that generated by Conway's \"leading\nnumber\" algorithm. The accompanying betting odds intuition adds insight into\nwhy Conway's algorithm works. The proof is simple and easy to generalize to\ngames involving more than two outcomes, unequal probabilities, and competing\npatterns of various length. Additional results on the expected duration of\nPenney's game are presented. Code implementing and cross-validating the\nalgorithms is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 18:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 09:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}
