In addition, this paper aims to quantify how effective the model\npresented in this work is at providing energy to the coronal volume.\n  Methods: The model is presented and explored through the use of several\nnumerical experiments which were carried out using the Lare2D code. The\nexperiments study footpoint driven Alfv\\'en waves in the neighbourhood of a\ntwo-dimensional x-type null point with initially uniform density and plasma\npressure. A continuous sinusoidal driver with a constant frequency is used.\nEach experiment uses different driver amplitudes to compare weakly nonlinear\nexperiments with linear experiments.\n  Results: We find that the wave trains phase-mix owing to variations in the\nlength of each field line and variations in the field strength. The\nnonlinearities reduce the amount of energy entering the domain, as they reduce\nthe effectiveness of the driver, but they have relatively little effect on the\ndamping rate (for the range of amplitudes studied). The nonlinearities produce\ndensity structures which change the natural frequencies of the field lines and\nhence cause the resonant locations to move. The shifting of the resonant\nlocation causes the Poynting flux associated with the driver to decrease.\nReducing the magnetic diffusivity increases the energy build-up on the resonant\nfield lines, however, it has little effect on the total amount of energy\nentering the system. From an order of magnitude estimate, we show that the\nPoynting flux in our experiments is comparable to the energy requirements of\nthe quiet Sun corona. However a (possibly unphysically) large amount of\nmagnetic diffusion was used however and it remains unclear if the model is able\nto provide enough energy under actual coronal conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 16:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

As many as 60% of people with epilepsy\nexperience focal seizures which originate in a certain brain area and are\nlimited to part of one cerebral hemisphere. In focal epilepsy patients, a\nprecise surgical removal of the seizure onset zone can lead to effective\nseizure control or even a seizure-free outcome. Thus, correct identification of\nthe seizure onset zone is essential. For clinical evaluation purposes,\nelectroencephalography (EEG) recordings are commonly used. However, their\ninterpretation is usually done manually by physicians and is time-consuming and\nerror-prone. In this work, we propose an automated epileptic signal\nclassification method based on modern deep learning methods. In contrast to\nprevious approaches, the network is trained directly on the EEG recordings,\navoiding hand-crafted feature extraction and selection procedures. This\nexploits the ability of deep neural networks to detect and extract relevant\nfeatures automatically, that may be too complex or subtle to be noticed by\nhumans. The proposed network structure is based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork with residual connections. We demonstrate that our network produces\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmark data sets, a data set from Bonn\nUniversity and the Bern-Barcelona data set. We conclude that modern deep\nlearning approaches can reach state-of-the-art performance on epileptic EEG\nclassification and automated seizure onset zone identification tasks when\ntrained on raw EEG data.

In this paper, we use martingale theory\nto derive the integral fluctuation relation $\\langle e^{-S_{\\rm\ntot}(T)}\\rangle=1$ for the stochastic entropy production $S_{\\rm tot}$ in a\nstationary physical system at stochastic stopping times $T$. This fluctuation\nrelation implies the law $\\langle S_{\\rm tot}(T)\\rangle\\geq 0$, which states\nthat it is not possible to reduce entropy on average, even by stopping a\nstochastic process at a stopping time, and which we call the second law of\nthermodynamics at stopping times. This law implies bounds on the average amount\nof heat and work a system can extract from its environment when stopped at a\nrandom time. Furthermore, the integral fluctuation relation implies that\ncertain fluctuations of entropy production are universal or are bounded by\nuniversal functions. These universal properties descend from the integral\nfluctuation relation by selecting appropriate stopping times: for example, when\n$T$ is a first-passage time for entropy production, then we obtain a bound on\nthe statistics of negative records of entropy production. We illustrate these\nresults on simple models of nonequilibrium systems described by Langevin\nequations and reveal two interesting phenomena. First, we demonstrate that\nisothermal mesoscopic systems can extract on average heat from their\nenvironment when stopped at a cleverly chosen moment and the second law at\nstopping times provides a bound on the average extracted heat. Second, we\ndemonstrate that the average efficiency at stopping times of an autonomous\nstochastic heat engines, such as Feymann's ratchet, can be larger than the\nCarnot efficiency and the second law of thermodynamics at stopping times\nprovides a bound on the average efficiency at stopping times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 17:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 23:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 10:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 10:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Answering these questions is an\nimportant step toward understanding star and cluster formation across the\nextreme range of environments found in the Universe.\n  Requirements: sensitivity and angular resolution improvements will allow us\nto study the full range of environments found in the Milky Way.

The intricate neurovascular couplings that govern fMRI's\nblood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional contrast are invaluable in\nmapping active brain regions, but they also entail significant limitations,\nsuch as non-specificity of the signal to active foci. Diffusion-weighted\nfunctional MRI (dfMRI) with relatively high diffusion-weighting strives to\nameliorate this shortcoming as it offers functional contrasts more intimately\nlinked with the underlying activity. Insofar, apart from somewhat smaller\nactivation foci, dfMRI's contrasts have not been convincingly shown to offer\nsignificant advantages over BOLD, and its contrasts relied on significant\nmodelling. Here, we study whether dfMRI could offer a better representation of\nneural activity in the thalamocortical pathway compared to its (spin-echo (SE))\nBOLD counterpart. Using high-end forepaw stimulation experiments in the rat at\n9.4 T, and with significant sensitivity enhancements due to the use of\ncryocoils, we show for the first time that dfMRI signals exhibit layer\nspecificity, and, additionally, display signals in areas devoid of SE-BOLD\nresponses.

This\nwork evaluates the use of principal-component-analysis (PCA) denoising to\nmitigate these SNR demands and improve the precision of relaxometry measures.\nMETHODS: PCA denoising was evaluated using both simulated and experimental MRI\ndata. Bi-exponential transverse relaxation signals were simulated for a wide\nrange of acquisition and sample parameters, and experimental data were acquired\nfrom three excised and fixed mouse brains. In both cases, standard relaxometry\nanalysis was performed on both original and denoised image data, and resulting\nestimated signal parameters were compared. RESULTS: Denoising reduced the\nroot-mean-square-error of parameters estimated from multi-exponential\nrelaxometry by factors of 2 to 4x, for typical acquisition and sample\nparameters. Denoised images and subsequent parameter maps showed little or no\nsigns of spatial artifact or loss of resolution.

One key feature is that it is immune\nto post-processing, which means that arbitrary post-hoc computations can be\nperformed on privatized data without weakening differential privacy. It is\ntherefore common to filter private data streams. To characterize this setup, in\nthis paper we present error and entropy bounds for Kalman filtering\ndifferentially private state trajectories. We consider systems in which an\noutput trajectory is privatized in order to protect the state trajectory that\nproduced it. We provide bounds on a priori and a posteriori error and\ndifferential entropy of a Kalman filter which is processing the privatized\noutput trajectories. Using the error bounds we develop, we then provide\nguidelines to calibrate privacy levels in order to keep filter error within\npre-specified bounds.

Microlensing is the only way to find\nplanets from 0.5 to 5M_E at 1 to 5au.

We present\na new family of soft actuators that we refer to as Fluidic Fabric Muscle Sheets\n(FFMS). They are composite fabric structures that integrate fluidic\ntransmissions based on arrays of elastic tubes. These sheet-like actuators can\nstrain, squeeze, bend, and conform to hard or soft objects of arbitrary shapes\nor sizes, including the human body. We show how to design and fabricate FFMS\nactuators via facile apparel engineering methods, including computerized sewing\ntechniques. Together, these determine the distributions of stresses and strains\nthat can be generated by the FFMS. We present a simple mathematical model that\nproves effective for predicting their performance. FFMS can operate at\nfrequencies of 5 Hertz or more, achieve engineering strains exceeding 100%, and\nexert forces greater than 115 times their own weight. They can be safely used\nin intimate contact with the human body even when delivering stresses exceeding\n10$^\\text{6}$ Pascals. We demonstrate their versatility for actuating a variety\nof bodies or structures, and in configurations that perform multi-axis\nactuation, including bending and shape change.

Region $R_i$\nrepresents the uncertainty region of $x_i$. We consider the following question:\nhow fast can we establish order if we are allowed to preprocess the regions in\n$R$? The preprocessing model of uncertainty uses two consecutive phases: a\npreprocessing phase which has access only to ${R}$ followed by a reconstruction\nphase during which a desired structure on $X$ is computed. Recent results in\nthis model parametrize the reconstruction time by the ply of ${R}$, which is\nthe maximum overlap between the regions in ${R}$. We introduce the ambiguity\n$A({R})$ as a more fine-grained measure of the degree of overlap in ${R}$. We\nshow how to preprocess a set of $d$-dimensional disks in $O(n \\log n)$ time\nsuch that we can sort $X$ (if $d=1$) and reconstruct a quadtree on $X$ (if\n$d\\geq 1$ but constant) in $O(A({R}))$ time.

The number of comparisons necessary to find the\nlinear order underlying a poset $P$ is lower-bounded by the graph entropy of\n$P$. We show that if $P$ is an interval order, then the ambiguity provides a\nconstant-factor approximation of the graph entropy.

Since\nthe negative log-likelihood under multivariate normal sampling is convex in\n$\\Sigma^{-1}$, the inverse of its covariance matrix, it is common to add to it\na penalty which is also convex in $\\Sigma^{-1}$. More recently, Deng-Tsui\n(2013) and Yu et al.(2017) have proposed penalties which are functions of the\neigenvalues of $\\Sigma$, and are convex in $\\log \\Sigma$, but not in\n$\\Sigma^{-1}$. The resulting penalized optimization problem is not convex in\neither $\\log \\Sigma$ or $\\Sigma^{-1}$. In this paper, we note that this\noptimization problem is geodesically convex in $\\Sigma$, which allows us to\nestablish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding penalized\ncovariance matrices. More generally, we show the equivalence of convexity in\n$\\log \\Sigma$ and geodesic convexity for penalties on $\\Sigma$ which are\nstrictly functions of their eigenvalues. In addition, when using such\npenalties, we show that the resulting optimization problem reduces to to a\n$q$-dimensional convex optimization problem on the eigenvalues of $\\Sigma$,\nwhich can then be readily solved via Newton-Raphson. Finally, we argue that it\nis better to apply these penalties to the shape matrix $\\Sigma/(\\det\n\\Sigma)^{1/q}$ rather than to $\\Sigma$ itself. A simulation study and an\nexample illustrate the advantages of applying the penalty to the shape matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 22:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

Typically, dust masses are derived from\n(sub-)millimeter flux density measurements plus assumptions for the opacity,\ntemperature, and optical depth of the dust. Here we use radiative transfer\nmodels to quantify the validity of these assumptions with the aim of improving\nthe accuracy of disk dust mass measurements. We first carry out a controlled\nexploration of disk parameter space. We find that the disk temperature is a\nstrong function of disk size, while the optical depth depends on both disk size\nand dust mass. The millimeter-wavelength spectral index can be significantly\nshallower than the naive expectation due to a combination of optical depth and\ndeviations from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. We fit radiative transfer models to\nthe spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 132 disks in the Taurus-Auriga\nregion using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We used all available data to\nproduce the most complete SEDs used in any extant modeling study. We perform\nthe fitting twice: first with unconstrained disk sizes and again imposing the\ndisk size--brightness relation inferred for sources in Taurus. This constraint\ngenerally forces the disks to be smaller, warmer, and more optically thick.\nFrom both sets of fits, we find disks to be $\\sim$1--5 times more massive than\nwhen derived using (sub-)millimeter measurements and common assumptions.

As a main result we derive a homogenized bending-torsion theory for\nrods as $\\Gamma$-limit from 3D nonlinear elasticity by simultaneous\nhomogenization and dimension reduction under the assumption that the prestrain\nis of the order of the diameter of the rod. The limit model features a\nspontaneous curvature-torsion tensor that captures the macroscopic effect of\nthe micro-heterogeneous prestrain. We device a formula that allows to compute\nthe spontaneous curvature-torsion tensor by means of a weighted average of the\ngiven prestrain. The weight in the average depends on the geometry of the\ncomposite and invokes correctors that are defined with help of boundary value\nproblems for the system of linear elasticity. The definition of the correctors\ndepends on a relative scaling parameter $\\gamma$, which monitors the ratio\nbetween the diameter of the rod and the period of the composite's\nmicrostructure.

Our contributions are as\nfollows: 1) We construct new codes for matrix multiplication that achieve the\nsame fault/straggler tolerance as the previously constructed MatDot Codes and\nPolynomial Codes. Unlike previous codes that use polynomials expanded in a\nmonomial basis, our codes uses a basis of orthogonal polynomials. 2) We show\nthat the condition number of every $m \\times m$ sub-matrix of an $m \\times n, n\n\\geq m$ Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrix, evaluated on the $n$-point Chebyshev\ngrid, grows as $O(n^{2(n-m)})$ for $n > m$. An implication of this result is\nthat, when Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices are used for coded computing, for a\nfixed number of redundant nodes $s=n-m,$ the condition number grows at most\npolynomially in the number of nodes $n$. 3) By specializing our orthogonal\npolynomial based constructions to Chebyshev polynomials, and using our\ncondition number bound for Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices, we construct new\nnumerically stable techniques for coded matrix multiplication. We empirically\ndemonstrate that our constructions have significantly lower numerical errors\ncompared to previous approaches which involve inversion of Vandermonde\nmatrices. We generalize our constructions to explore the trade-off between\ncomputation/communication and fault-tolerance. 4) We propose a numerically\nstable specialization of Lagrange coded computing.

There are two computational approaches to count\nshort cycles (with length smaller than $2g$, where $g$ is the girth of the\ngraph) in bipartite graphs. The first approach is applicable to a general\n(irregular) bipartite graph, and uses the spectrum $\\{\\eta_i\\}$ of the directed\nedge matrix of the graph to compute the multiplicity $N_k$ of $k$-cycles with\n$k < 2g$ through the simple equation $N_k = \\sum_i \\eta_i^k/(2k)$.

After thermal runaway, electron\ncaptures on the ashes left behind by the burning front determine a loss of\npressure, which impacts the dynamics of the explosion and the neutron excess of\nmatter. Indeed, overproduction of neutron-rich species such as $^{54}$Cr has\nbeen deemed a problem of Chandrasekhar-mass models of SNIa for a long time. I\npresent the results of a sensitivity study of SNIa models to the rates of weak\ninteractions, which have been incorporated directly into the hydrodynamic\nexplosion code. The weak rates have been scaled up/down by a factor ten, either\nglobally for a common bibliographical source, or individually for selected\nisotopes. In line with previous works, the impact of weak rates uncertainties\non sub-Chandrasekhar models of SNIa is almost negligible. The impact on the\ndynamics of Chandrasekhar-mass models and on the yield of $^{56}$Ni is also\nscarce. The strongest effect is found on the nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich\nnuclei, such as $^{48}$Ca, $^{54}$Cr, $^{58}$Fe, and $^{64}$Ni. The species\nwith the highest influence on nucleosynthesis do not coincide with the isotopes\nthat contribute most to the neutronization of matter. Among the last ones,\nthere are protons, $^{54,55}$Fe, $^{55}$Co, and $^{56}$Ni, while the main\ninfluencers are $^{54,55}$Mn and $^{55-57}$Fe, in disagreement with Parikh et\nal (2013), who found that SNIa nucleosynthesis is most sensitive to the\n$\\beta^+$-decay rates of $^{28}$Si, $^{32}$S, and $^{36}$Ar. An eventual\nincrease in all weak rates on pf-shell nuclei would affect the dynamical\nevolution of hot bubbles, running away at the beginning of the explosion, and\nthe yields of SNIa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 05:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Propagation-based x-ray\nphase-contrast imaging and tomography have been mostly used to resolve\nmicrometer-scale structures inside weakly absorbing objects as well as inside\ndense specimens. Indirect x-ray detection has been the key technology to\nachieve up to sub-micrometer spatial resolutions, albeit inefficiently and\nhence at the expense of increased radiation dose to the specimen. A promising\napproach to low-dose imaging and high spatial resolution even at high x-ray\nenergies is ghost imaging, which could use single-pixel, yet efficient direct\nx-ray detectors made of high-density materials.

However, due to\nnon-linearities in their image formation model, a high photon flux (e.g., due\nto strong sunlight) leads to distortion of the incident temporal waveform, and\npotentially, large depth errors. Operating SPADs in low flux regimes can\nmitigate these distortions, but, often requires attenuating the signal and\nthus, results in low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we address the\nfollowing basic question: what is the optimal photon flux that a SPAD-based\nLiDAR should be operated in? We derive a closed form expression for the optimal\nflux, which is quasi-depth-invariant, and depends on the ambient light\nstrength. The optimal flux is lower than what a SPAD typically measures in real\nworld scenarios, but surprisingly, considerably higher than what is\nconventionally suggested for avoiding distortions. We propose a simple,\nadaptive approach for achieving the optimal flux by attenuating incident flux\nbased on an estimate of ambient light strength. Using extensive simulations and\na hardware prototype, we show that the optimal flux criterion holds for several\ndepth estimators, under a wide range of illumination conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 05:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 04:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The warm climate is analogous to the present one; the snowball\nclimate features global glaciation and conditions that can hardly support life\nforms. Paleoclimatic evidences suggest that in the past our planet flipped\nbetween these two states. The main physical mechanism responsible for such an\ninstability is the ice-albedo feedback. In a previous work, we defined the\nMelancholia states that sit between the two climates. Such states are embedded\nin the boundaries between the two basins of attraction and feature extensive\nglaciation down to relatively low latitudes. Here, we explore the global\nstability properties of the system by introducing random perturbations as\nmodulations to the intensity of the incoming solar radiation. We observe\nnoise-induced transitions between the competing basins of attraction. In the\nweak noise limit, large deviation laws define the invariant measure, the\nstatistics of escape times, and typical escape paths called instantons. By\nconstructing the instantons empirically, we show that the Melancholia states\nare the gateways for the noise-induced transitions. In the region of\nmultistability, in the zero-noise limit, the measure is supported only on one\nof the competing attractors. For low (high) values of the solar irradiance, the\nlimit measure is the snowball (warm) climate. The changeover between the two\nregimes corresponds to a first-order phase transition in the system.

In this mechanism, that\noperates in the jittering jets explosion mechanism and comes on top of the\nregular magnetic field amplification by turbulence, the accretion of stochastic\nangular momentum in core collapse supernovae forms a neutron star with strong\ninitial magnetic fields but with a slow rotation. The varying angular momentum\nof the accreted gas, which is unique to the jittering jets explosion mechanism,\nexerts a varying azimuthal shear on the magnetic fields of the accreted mass\nnear the surface of the neutron star. This, I argue, can form an amplifying\neffect which I term the stochastic omega (S$\\omega$) effect. In the common\n$\\alpha \\omega$ dynamo the rotation has constant direction and value, and hence\nsupplies a constant azimuthal shear, while the convection has a stochastic\nbehavior. In the S$\\omega$ dynamo the stochastic angular momentum is different\nfrom turbulence in that it operates on a large scale, and it is different from\na regular rotational shear in being stochastic. The basic assumption is that\nbecause of the varying direction of the angular momentum axis from one\naccretion episode to the next, the rotational flow of an accretion episode\nstretches the magnetic fields that were amplified in the previous episode.

The effect of adding\nadditional water in an MM fashion on the geometry optimized nanoparticle\nstructure is small, but more evident effects are seen in its electronic\nproperties.

Any attempt to\nreduce the losses of the resonant system, and hence store a (mechanical,\nacoustic, electronic, optical, atomic, or of any other nature) wave for more\ntime, will inevitably also reduce the bandwidth of the system. Until recently,\nthis time-bandwidth limit has been considered fundamental, arising from basic\nFourier reciprocity. A recent theory suggested that it might in fact be\novercome by breaking Lorentz reciprocity in the resonant system, reinvigorated\na debate about whether (or not) this was indeed the case. Here, we report an\nexperimental realization of a cavity where, inducing nonreciprocity by breaking\nthe time invariance, we do overcome the fundamental time-bandwidth limit of\nordinary resonant systems by a factor of 30, in full agreement with\naccompanying numerical simulations. We show that, although in practice\nexperimental constraints limit our scheme, the time bandwidth product can be\narbitrarily large, simply dictated by the finesse of the cavity.

Existing\nresearch treats phrases as either compositional or non-compositional in a\ndeterministic manner. In this paper, we operationalize the viewpoint that\ncompositionality is contextual rather than deterministic, i.e., that whether a\nphrase is compositional or non-compositional depends on its context. For\nexample, the phrase `green card' is compositional when referring to a green\ncolored card, whereas it is non-compositional when meaning permanent residence\nauthorization. We address the challenge of detecting this type of contextual\ncompositionality as follows: given a multi-word phrase, we enrich the word\nembedding representing its semantics with evidence about its global context\n(terms it often collocates with) as well as its local context (narratives where\nthat phrase is used, which we call usage scenarios). We further extend this\nrepresentation with information extracted from external knowledge bases. The\nresulting representation incorporates both localized context and more general\nusage of the phrase and allows to detect its compositionality in a\nnon-deterministic and contextual way.

We use the experimental soft phonon spectral\nweight to calculate the strength of the bi-phonon mediated pairing interaction\nin the electron doped material and show that it is of the correct magnitude\nwhen compared to the experimental value of the superconducting critical\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 09:04:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 11:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 08:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

The aim is to observe those NEOs that are going to hit\nthe Earth within a few weeks or days, in advance of impact. In order to\nestimate the detection rate of NEOs with the Flyeye telescope, a synthetic\npopulation of Earth threatening asteroids is created by means of the software\nNEOPOP.

When operating two telescopes simultaneously,\none at Monte Mufara and one at La Silla, four detected impacts per year are\nexpected. Nonetheless, it is estimated that about 15.6% of the Earth impactors\nwill be very difficult to be detected using ground-based telescopes due to the\nfact that they are approaching us from the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 09:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

However, these\ntechniques demand very specialised skills. People willing to analyse data often\nlack these skills, so they must rely on data scientists, which hinders data\nmining democratisation. Different approaches have appeared in the last years to\naddress this issue.\n  Objective: Analyse the state of the art to know how far are we from an\neffective data mining democratisation, what has already been accomplished, and\nwhat should be done in the upcoming years.\n  Method: We performed a state-of-the-art review following a systematic and\nobjective procedure, which included works both from the academia and the\nindustry. The reviewed works were grouped in four categories. Each category was\nthen evaluated in detail using a well-defined evaluation criteria to identify\nits strengths and weaknesses.\n  Results: Around 700 works were initially considered, from which 43 were\nfinally selected for a more in-depth analysis. Only two out of the four\nidentified categories provide effective solutions to data mining\ndemocratisation. From these two categories, one always requires a minimum\nintervention of a data scientist, whereas the other one does not provide\nsupport for all the stages of the data mining process, and might exhibit\naccuracy problems in some contexts.\n  Conclusion: In all analysed approaches, a data scientist is still required to\nperform some steps of the analysis process. Moreover, automated approaches that\ndo not require data scientists for some steps expose some problems in other\nquality attributes, such as accuracy. Therefore, although existent work shows\nsome promising initial steps, we are still far from data mining\ndemocratisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 10:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

We propose to add fluctuations to the diffusion length by choosing this\nquantity for each adsorbed particle from a Gaussian distribution, where the\nvariance of the distribution serves as a fitting parameter.

We find numerous line profile characteristics\nlinearly correlate with the disc-integrated convection-induced velocities.\nRemoving the various correlations with the line bisector, equivalent width, and\nthe V_asy indicator may reduce ~50-60% of the granulation noise in the measured\nvelocities. We also find that simultaneous photometry may be a key diagnostic,\nas our proxy for photometric brightness also allowed us to remove ~50% of the\ngranulation-induced radial velocity noise. These correlations and\ngranulation-noise mitigations breakdown in the presence of low instrumental\nresolution and/or increased stellar rotation, as both act to smooth the\nobserved line profile asymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 11:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

While double diffusion\nencoding (DDE) MRI methods are widely used to extract accurate {\\mu}FA, it has\nonly recently been proposed that powder-averaged single diffusion encoding\n(SDE) signals, when coupled with the diffusion standard model (SM) and a set of\nconstraints, could be used for {\\mu}FA estimation. This study aims to evaluate\n{\\mu}FA as derived from the spherical mean technique (SMT) set of constraints,\nas well as more generally for powder-averaged SM signals. Methods: SDE\nexperiments were performed at 16.4 T on an ex vivo mouse brain\n({\\Delta}/{\\delta} = 12/1.5 ms). The {\\mu}FA maps obtained from powder-averaged\nSDE signals were then compared to maps obtained from DDE-MRI experiments\n({\\Delta}/{\\tau}/{\\delta} = 12/12/1.5 ms), which allow a model-free estimation\nof {\\mu}FA.

Editing such sequences raises\nspecific issues due to the ambiguous nature of musical objects. The first\nsource of ambiguity is that musicians naturally produce many deviations from\nthe metrical frame. These deviations may be intentional or subconscious, but\nthey play an important role in conveying the groove or feeling of a\nperformance. Relations between musical elements are also usually implicit,\ncreating even more ambiguity. A note is in relation with the surrounding notes\nin many possible ways: it can be part of a melodic pattern, it can also play a\nharmonic role with the simultaneous notes, or be a pedal-tone. All these\naspects play an essential role that should be preserved, as much as possible,\nwhen editing musical sequences.\n  In this paper, we contribute specifically to the problem of editing\nnon-quantized, metrical musical sequences represented as MIDI files.

We propose combining a coarse (i.e. computationally cheap but not\nvery accurate) predictive physics model, with a fine (i.e. computationally\nexpensive but accurate) predictive physics model, to generate a hybrid model\nthat is at the required speed and accuracy for a given manipulation task.

Such approaches allow the size, growth and\nmortality of individual trees to be measured, enabling forest carbon stocks and\ndynamics to be tracked and understood. Many algorithms exist for structurally\nsimple forests including coniferous forests and plantations. Finding a robust\nsolution for structurally complex, species-rich tropical forests remains a\nchallenge; existing segmentation algorithms often perform less well than simple\narea-based approaches when estimating plot-level biomass. Here we describe a\nMulti-Class Graph Cut (MCGC) approach to tree crown delineation. This uses\nlocal three-dimensional geometry and density information, alongside knowledge\nof crown allometries, to segment individual tree crowns from LiDAR point\nclouds. Our approach robustly identifies trees in the top and intermediate\nlayers of the canopy, but cannot recognise small trees. From these\nthree-dimensional crowns, we are able to measure individual tree biomass.\nComparing these estimates to those from permanent inventory plots, our\nalgorithm is able to produce robust estimates of hectare-scale carbon density,\ndemonstrating the power of ITC approaches in monitoring forests. The\nflexibility of our method to add additional dimensions of information, such as\nspectral reflectance, make this approach an obvious avenue for future\ndevelopment and extension to other sources of three-dimensional data, such as\nstructure from motion datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 12:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

Demographic studies, interviews with radicalized subjects, analysis\nof terrorist databases, reveal that the path to radicalization occurs along\nprogressive steps, where age, social context and peer-to-peer exchanges play\nmajor roles. To execute terrorist attacks, radicals must efficiently\ncommunicate with one another while maintaining secrecy; they are also subject\nto pressure from counter-terrorism agencies, public opinion and the need for\nmaterial resources. Similarly, government entities must gauge which\nintervention methods are most effective.

However, extracting data from videos is\noften challenging. Nevertheless, it has been recently demonstrated that\naccurate and precise estimates of density for animals (whose normal activities\nare restricted to a bounded area or home range) can be obtained from counts\naveraged across a relatively low number of video frames. The method, however,\nrequires that individual detectability (PID, the probability of detecting a\ngiven animal provided that it is actually within the area surveyed by a camera)\nhas to be known. Here we propose a Bayesian implementation for estimating PID\nafter combining counts from cameras with counts from any reference method.

Density and PID were calculated\nafter combining fish counts from unbaited remote underwater video (RUV) and\nunderwater visual censuses (UVC) as reference method. The relevance of the\nproposed framework is that after estimating PID, fish density can be estimated\naccurately and precisely at the UVC scale (or at the scale of the preferred\nreference method) using RUV only. This key statement has been extensively\ndemonstrated using computer simulations yielded by real empirical data.\nFinally, we provide a simulation tool-kit for comparing the expected precision\nattainable for different sampling effort and for species with different levels\nof PID.

The hypotheses,\non which the analytical model relies, are validated by experimental results.\nThe open lossy resonator, consisting of a finite length beam thinner than the\nmain beam, presents both energy leakage due to the aperture of the resonators\nto the main beam and inherent losses due to the viscoelastic damping.

In this\npaper, we propose a Prioritized Process Test (PPT), which is a model-based test\ncase generation algorithm that represents an alternative to currently\nestablished algorithms that use directed graphs and test requirements to model\nthe system under test. The PPT accepts a directed multigraph as a model to\nexpress priorities, and edge weights are used instead of test requirements. To\ndetermine the test-coverage level of test cases, a test-depth-level concept is\nused.

Deep-learning methods have\nbecome the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection\nsystem to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of\nexemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning\narchitecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface\nanomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection.\nThe design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small\nnumber of samples, which is an important requirement for practical\napplications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning\nmethods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the\nproposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of\nsurface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the\nrequired precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples\nand on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly\ncreated dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates\nthat the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected\nsurfaces, using only approximately 25-30 defective training samples, instead of\nhundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications.\nThis makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the\nnumber of available defective samples is limited.

A usable form of the nuclear energy density functional that is\nrooted in the modern theory of nuclear forces was presented recently. The first\ncomponent of this new set of functionals corresponds to the direct part\n(Hartree term) of the expectation value of local chiral potentials on a Slater\ndeterminant.

We propose an\napproach that enables deep reinforcement learning to train policies that are\ngentle, both during exploration and task execution. In a reward-based learning\nenvironment, a natural approach involves augmenting the (task) reward with a\npenalty for non-gentleness, which can be defined as excessive impact force.\nHowever, augmenting with only this penalty impairs learning: policies get stuck\nin a local optimum which avoids all contact with the environment. Prior\nresearch has shown that combining auxiliary tasks or intrinsic rewards can be\nbeneficial for stabilizing and accelerating learning in sparse-reward domains,\nand indeed we find that introducing a surprise-based intrinsic reward does\navoid the no-contact failure case. However, we show that a simple\ndynamics-based surprise is not as effective as penalty-based surprise.\nPenalty-based surprise, based on predicting forceful contacts, has a further\nbenefit: it encourages exploration which is contact-rich yet gentle.

In recent years, convolutional sparse coding (CSC) has\nbeen developed to address these problems. In this paper, inspired by several\nsuccessful applications of CSC in the field of signal processing, we explore\nthe potential of CSC in sparse-view CT reconstruction. By directly working on\nthe whole image, without the necessity of dividing the image into overlapped\npatches in DL-based methods, the proposed methods can maintain more details and\navoid artifacts caused by patch aggregation. With predetermined filters, an\nalternating scheme is developed to optimize the objective function.

The largest possible\ncardinality of NICG of a dimension $d$, denoted by $N(d)$, provides an upper\nbound on the sparsity of systems of integer equations with a large number of\ninteger variables. A better estimate of $N(d)$ means that we can consider\nsmaller sub-systems of integer equations when solving systems with many integer\nvariables. Furthermore, given that we can reduce constraints on set algebra\nexpressions to constraints on cardinalities of Venn regions, tighter upper\nbound on $N(d)$ yields a more efficient decision procedure for a logic of sets\nwith cardinality constraints (BAPA), which has been applied in software\nverification. Previous attempts to compute $N(d)$ using SAT solvers have not\nsucceeded even for $d=3$. The only known values were computed manually:\n$N(d)=d$ for $d < 4$ and $N(4) > 4$. We provide the first exact values for $d >\n3$, namely, $N(4)=5$, $N(5)=7$, and $N(6)=9$, which is a significant\nimprovement of the known asymptotic bound (which would give only e.g. $N(6) \\le\n29$, making a decision procedure impractical for $d=6$). We also give lower\nbounds for $N(7)$, $N(8)$, $N(9)$, and $N(10)$, which are: $11$, $13$, $14$,\nand $16$, respectively.

One form of interdependence between\ncountries is the diffusion of country-level features, such as policies,\npolitical regimes, or conflict. In these studies, the outcome variable tends to\nbe categorical, and the primary concern is the clustering of the outcome\nvariable among connected countries. Statistically, such clustering is studied\nwith spatial econometric models. This paper instead proposes the use of a\nstatistical network approach to model diffusion with a binary outcome variable.\nUsing statistical network instead of spatial econometric models allows for a\nmore natural specification of the diffusion process, assuming autocorrelation\nin the outcomes rather than the corresponding latent variable, and it\nsimplifies the inclusion of temporal dynamics, higher level interdependencies\nand interactions between network ties and country-level features. In our\nsimulations, the performance of the Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model (SAOM)\nestimator is evaluated. Our simulation results show that spatial parameters and\ncoefficients on additional covariates in a static binary spatial autoregressive\nmodel are accurately recovered when using SAOM, albeit on a different scale.

Kalman\nprediction is a classical approach for this task. The main drawback of X-ray\nacquisition is that it irradiates the patient, including its healthy tissues.\nIn the classical Kalman framework, X-ray measurements are taken regularly, i.e.\nat a constant rate. In this paper, we propose a new approach which relaxes this\nconstraint in order to take measurements when they are the most useful.

These optimal measurement times are obtained by\nsolving a combinatorial optimization problem using a genetic algorithm. We\ncreated a test benchmark on trajectories validated on one patient.

Of these two cases\nthe varying load case is much more challenging than the stable one. The\nmonitoring of wear can be done either directly e.g. optical methods or\nindirectly e.g. vibration. Monitoring actual wear is naturally the most\nreliable approach, but it often means that additional investments are needed.\nThe paper discusses how the monitoring of wear and need for maintenance can be\ndone based on the use of Cyber Physical Systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 11:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

One of the problems facing coffee farmers in\nBrazil is crop infestation, particularly by leaf rust Hemileia vastatrix and\nleaf miner Leucoptera coffeella. The progression of the diseases and or pests\noccurs spatially and temporarily. So, it is very important to automatically\nidentify the degree of severity. The main goal of this article consists on the\ndevelopment of a method and its i implementation as an App that allow the\ndetection of the foliar damages from images of coffee leaf that are captured\nusing a smartphone, and identify whether it is rust or leaf miner, and in turn\nthe calculation of its severity degree. The method consists of identifying a\nleaf from the image and separates it from the background with the use of a\nsegmentation algorithm. In the segmentation process, various types of\nbackgrounds for the image using the HSV and YCbCr color spaces are tested. In\nthe segmentation of foliar damages, the Otsu algorithm and the iterative\nthreshold algorithm, in the YCgCr color space, have been used and compared to\nk-means. Next, features of the segmented foliar damages are calculated. For the\nclassification, artificial neural network trained with extreme learning machine\nhave been used. The results obtained shows the feasibility and effectiveness of\nthe approach to identify and classify foliar damages, and the automatic\ncalculation of the severity. The results obtained are very promising according\nto experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Due to the sequential nature of RNNs, inference time is linearly\ndependent on the input length, and all inputs are read regardless of their\nimportance. Efforts to speed up this inference, known as 'neural speed\nreading', either ignore or skim over part of the input. We present\nStructural-Jump-LSTM: the first neural speed reading model to both skip and\njump text during inference. The model consists of a standard LSTM and two\nagents: one capable of skipping single words when reading, and one capable of\nexploiting punctuation structure (sub-sentence separators (,:), sentence end\nsymbols (.!?), or end of text markers) to jump ahead after reading a word. A\ncomprehensive experimental evaluation of our model against all five\nstate-of-the-art neural reading models shows that Structural-Jump-LSTM achieves\nthe best overall floating point operations (FLOP) reduction (hence is faster),\nwhile keeping the same accuracy or even improving it compared to a vanilla LSTM\nthat reads the whole text.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 12:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 08:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

With the development of non-rigid 3D\nshape analysis, there exist many shape descriptors. The intrinsic descriptors\ncan be explored to construct various intrinsic representations for non-rigid 3D\nshape retrieval task. The different intrinsic representations (features) focus\non different geometric properties to describe the same 3D shape, which makes\nthe representations are related. Therefore, it is possible and necessary to\nlearn multiple metrics for different representations jointly. We propose an\neffective multi-view metric learning algorithm by extending the Marginal Fisher\nAnalysis (MFA) into the multi-view domain, and exploring Hilbert-Schmidt\nIndependence Criteria (HSCI) as a diversity term to jointly learning the new\nmetrics. The different classes can be separated by MFA in our method.\nMeanwhile, HSCI is exploited to make the multiple representations to be\nconsensus.

Kohn-Sham density functional\ntheory (KS-DFT), due to its efficiency and accuracy, has achieved great success\nin describing ground state problems. To extend to excited state problems, our\ngroup recently demonstrated an approach with good numerical results to\ncalculate low-lying and Rydberg excitation energies of an $N$-electron system\nfrom a ground state KS or generalized KS calculations of an $(N-1)$-electron\nsystem via its orbital energies. In present work, we explore further the same\nmethodology to describe CT excitations. Numerical results from this work show\nthat performance of conventional density functional approximations (DFAs) is\nnot as good for CT excitations as for other excitations, due to the\ndelocalization error. Applying localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) to\nconventional DFAs, a recently developed method in our group to effectively\nreduce the delocalization error, can improve the results. Overall, the\nperformance of this methodology is better than time dependant DFT (TDDFT) with\nconventional DFAs. In addition, it shows that results from LOSC-DFAs in this\nmethod reach similar accuracy to other methods, such as $\\Delta$SCF, $G_0W_0$\nwith Bethe-Salpeter equations, particle-particle random phase approximation,\nand even high-level wavefunction method like CC2. Our analysis show that the\ncorrect $1/R$ trend for CT excitation can be captured from LOSC-DFA\ncalculations, stressing that the application of DFAs with minimal\ndelocalization error is essential within this methodology. This work provides\nan efficient way to calculate CT excitation energies from ground state DFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 15:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}
