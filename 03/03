This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It\nintroduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to\nseveral other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a\nnon-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The\nanalysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly\ncorrelated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such\nas bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a\nmarginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the\ninteractions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a\ncausality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures\nand shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across\ncurrencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of\nsignificative interactions. Overall our study uncovers a complex and rich\nstructure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other\nboth instantaneously and with lead-lag causal relations. A major finding is\nthat minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in\nshaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level\nof noise and the short time-series we verified that these networks are\nsignificant with all links statistically validated and with a structural\norganisation consistently reproduced across all networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 09:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

Regular relations are expressive formalisms which, using an\nappropriate string encoding, can capture relations definable in Presburger\nArithmetic. In fact, their expressive power coincide with relations definable\nin a universal automatic structure; equivalently, those definable by finite set\ninterpretations in WS1S (Weak Second Order Theory of One Successor).\nDetermining whether a regular relation admits a recognizable relation was known\nto be decidable (and in exponential time for binary relations), but its precise\ncomplexity still hitherto remains open. Our main contribution is to fully\nsettle the complexity of this decision problem by developing new techniques\nemploying infinite Ramsey theory. The complexity for DFA (resp.

This paper aims to provide the\ncontributions to the tesseral harmonics coefficients Cnm, Snm, and the Love\nnumbers knm to be expected from static tidal response in the gravity field of\nrotating Jupiter. For that purpose, we apply the method of Concentric Maclaurin\nEllipsoids (CMS). As we are interested in the variation of the tidal potential\nwith the longitudes of the moons, we take into account the simultaneous\npresence of the satellites Io, Europa, and Ganymede. We assume co-planar,\ncircular orbits with normals parallel to Jupiter's spin axis. The\nplanet-centered longitude of Io in the three-moon case is arbitrarily assumed\nvarphi = 0. Under these assumptions we find maximum amplitudes and fluctuations\nof 3.5 times 10^-8 +- 15% for C22. For the Love numbers, largest variation of\n10% to 20% is seen in k42 and k62, whereas the values k2, k33, and k44 fall\ninto narrow ranges of 0.1% uncertainty or less. In particular, we find\nk2=k2,Io(1 +- 0.02%) where k2,Io=0.5897 is the static tidal response to lone\nIo. Our obtained gravity field perturbation leads to a maximum equatorial shape\ndeformation of up to 28m. We suggest that should Juno measurements of the knm\ndeviate from those values, it may be due to dynamic or dissipative effects on\nJupiter's tidal response.

In this work we explore some\nalgebraic and spectral properties of these graphs associated to periodic and\nchaotic time series. We focus on the family of Feigenbaum graphs, which are\nHVGs constructed in correspondence with the trajectories of one-parameter\nunimodal maps undergoing a period-doubling route to chaos (Feigenbaum\nscenario).

Furthermore, we present an effective\nmulti-scale network architecture that works in both coarse-to-fine and\nfine-to-coarse manners for better exploiting information flow across scales.\nExperimental results on GoPro and Kohler datasets show that our proposed\nECPeNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art deep image deblurring\nmethods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 20:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In\ncontrast, the simulation of perfectly smooth ejecta where clumping arises from\nthe action of hydrodynamic instabilities produced a genus curve that is similar\nto a random Gaussian field, but disagrees strongly with the genus curve of the\nobserved image.

Crucially, instead of doing costly row/column\noperations on a sparse matrix, it computes traversals of a bipartite digraph.\nThis significantly reduces the running time and memory load (smaller fill-in\nand coefficient growth of the matrices). However, computing with AMT requires\nthe construction of a valid set of pivots (called a Morse matching).\n  We discover a family of Morse matchings on any chain complex of free modules\nof finite rank. We show that every acyclic matching is a subset of some member\nof our family, so all maximal Morse matchings are of this type.\n  Both the input and output of AMT are chain complexes, so the procedure can be\nused iteratively.

In this paper we propose a\nmatrix-formulation for non-decimated quaternion wavelet transforms and define\nspectral tools for use in machine learning tasks. Since quaternionic algebra is\nan extension of complex algebra, quaternion wavelets bring redundancy in the\ncomponents that proves beneficial in wavelet based tasks. Specifically, the\nwavelet coefficients in the decomposition are quaternion-valued numbers that\ndefine the modulus and three phases.\n  The novelty of this paper is definition of non-decimated quaternion wavelet\nspectra based on the modulus and phase-dependent statistics as low-dimensional\nsummaries for 1-D signals or 2-D images. A structural redundancy in\nnon-decimated wavelets and a componential redundancy in quaternion wavelets are\nlinked to extract more informative features.

The elastocaloric effect is a second rank tensor quantity\ndescribing the relation between entropy and strain. In contrast to the\nelastoresistivity, the elastocaloric effect is a thermodynamic quantity.\nExperimentally, elastocaloric effect measurements are demanding since the\nthermodynamic conditions during the measurement have to be well controlled.\nHere we present a technique to measure the elastocaloric effect under quasi\nadiabatic conditions. The technique is based on oscillating strain, which\nallows for increasing the frequency of the elastocaloric effect above the\nthermal relaxation rate of the sample. We apply the technique to Co-doped iron\npnictide superconductors and show that the thermodynamic signatures of second\norder phase transitions in the elastocaloric effect closely follow those\nobserved in calorimetry experiments. In contrast to the heat capacity, the\nelectronic signatures in the elastocaloric effect are measured against a small\nphononic background even at high temperatures, establishing this technique as a\npowerful complimentary tool for extracting the entropy landscape proximate to a\ncontinuous phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 23:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Additionally, we derive these notions for L2-regularized logistic\nregression and confirm existing findings that it is uniformly stable.

The proposed CAD-Net learns\nglobal and local contexts of objects by capturing their correlations with the\nglobal scene (at scene-level) and the local neighboring objects or features (at\nobject-level), respectively. In addition, it designs a spatial-and-scale-aware\nattention module that guides the network to focus on more informative regions\nand features as well as more appropriate feature scales.

We study the\nlifecycle of information cascades to understand what leads to saturation of\ngrowth in terms of cascade reshares, thereby resulting in expiration, an event\nwe call ``diffusion inhibition''. In an attempt to understand what causes\ninhibition, we use motifs to dissect the network obtained from information\ncascades coupled with traces of historical diffusion or social network links.\nOur main results follow from experiments on a dataset of cascades from the\nWeibo platform and the Flixster movie ratings. We observe the temporal counts\nof 5-node undirected motifs from the cascade temporal networks leading to the\ninhibition stage. Empirical evidences from the analysis lead us to conclude the\nfollowing about stages preceding inhibition: (1) individuals tend to adopt\ninformation more from users they have known in the past through social networks\nor previous interactions thereby creating patterns containing triads more\nfrequently than acyclic patterns with linear chains and (2) users need multiple\nexposures or rounds of social reinforcement for them to adopt an information\nand as a result information starts spreading slowly thereby leading to the\ndeath of the cascade. Following these observations, we use motif based features\nto predict the edge cardinality of the network exhibited at the time of\ninhibition. We test features of motif patterns by using regression models for\nboth individual patterns and their combination and we find that motifs as\nfeatures are better predictors of the future network organization than\nindividual node centralities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 08:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

Such is the current status of bulk bismuth. While\nsome theoretical models indicate that bismuth possesses a trivial topological\nnature, other theoretical and experimental studies suggest non-trivial\ntopological classifications such as a strong or a higher order topological\ninsulator, both of which hosts helical modes on their boundaries. Here we use a\nnovel approach to resolve the topological classification of bismuth by\nspectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary modes to a topological\ndefect in the form of a screw dislocation (SD). We find that the edge mode\nextends over a wide energy range, and withstands crystallographic\nirregularities, without showing any signs of backscattering. It seems to bind\nto the bulk SD, as expected for a topological insulator (TI) with non-vanishing\nweak indices. We argue that the small scale of the bulk energy gap, at the time\nreversal symmetric momentum $L$, positions bismuth within the critical region\nof a topological phase transition to a strong TI with non-vanishing weak\nindices. We show that the observed boundary modes are approximately helical\nalready on the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ trivial side of the topological phase transition.\nThis work opens the door for further possibilities to examine the response of\ntopological phases to crystallographic topological defects, and to uniquely\nexplore their associated bulk boundary phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 11:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

Up to now, many materials have been theoretically\nproposed and experimentally proved to host different kinds of topological\nstates. Unfortunately, there is little convincing experimental evidence for the\nexistence of topological oxides. The reason is that oxidation of oxygen leads\nto ionic crystal in general and makes band inversion unlikely. In addition, the\nrealization of different topological states in a single material is quite\ndifficult, but strongly needed for exploring topological phase transitions. In\nthis work, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we\npropose that the experimentally tunable continuous solid solution of oxygen in\npyrochlore Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_{6+x}$ ($ 0\\leq x \\leq 1.0$) leads to various\ntopological states. Topological insulator, Dirac semimetal and triply\ndegenerate nodal point semimetal can be realized in it via changing the oxygen\ncontent and/or tuning the crystalline symmetries. When $x = 1$, it is a\nsemimetal with quadratic band touching point at Fermi level. It transits into a\nDirac semimetal or a topological insulator depending on the in-plane strain.\nWhen $x = 0.5$, the inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken in\nTl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_{6.5}$, leading to triply degenerate nodal points. When $x = 0$,\nTl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_6$ becomes a trivial insulator with a narrow band gap. These\ntopological phase transitions driven by solid solution of oxygen are unique and\nphysically plausible due to the variation of valence state of $Tl^{1+}$ and\n$Tl^{3+}$. This topological oxide will be promising for studying correlation\ninduced topological states and potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 12:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 13:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 13:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 11:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

We consider state based\nperidynamic models where the force at a material point is due to both the\nstrain between two points and the change in volume inside the domain of\nnonlocal interaction. The pairwise interactions between points are mediated by\na bond potential of multi-well type while multi point interactions are\nassociated with volume change mediated by a hydrostatic strain potential. The\nhydrostatic potential can either be a quadratic function, delivering a linear\nforce-strain relation, or a multi-well type that can be associated with\nmaterial degradation and cavitation. We first show the well-posedness of the\nperidynamic formulation and that peridynamic evolutions exist in the Sobolev\nspace $H^2$. We show that the finite element approximations converge to the\n$H^2$ solutions uniformly as measured in the mean square norm. For linear\ncontinuous finite elements the convergence rate is shown to be $C_t \\Delta t +\nC_s h^2/\\epsilon^2$, where $\\epsilon$ is the size of horizon, $h$ is the mesh\nsize, and $\\Delta t$ is the size of time step. The constants $C_t$ and $C_s$\nare independent of $\\Delta t$ and $h$ and may depend on $\\epsilon$ through the\nnorm of the exact solution. We demonstrate the stability of the semi-discrete\napproximation. The stability of the fully discrete approximation is shown for\nthe linearized peridynamic force.

Layer normalization and group normalization\nare data-dependent and thus must be continually used, even at test-time. To\naddress the issues that arise from using explicit normalization techniques, we\npropose to replace existing normalization methods with a simple, secondary\nobjective loss that we term a standardization loss. This formulation is\nflexible and robust across different batch sizes and surprisingly, this\nsecondary objective accelerates learning on the primary training objective.\nBecause it is a training loss, it is simply removed at test-time, and no\nfurther effort is needed to maintain normalized activations. We find that a\nstandardization loss accelerates training on both small- and large-scale image\nclassification experiments, works with a variety of architectures, and is\nlargely robust to training across different batch sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 15:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

This research takes the usage of ClassStart as research scenario and\ninvestigates the individual acceptance of technology through the Unified Theory\nof Acceptance and Use of Technology, as well as technological quality through\nthe Delone and McLean IS success model. A total of 307 undergraduate students\nusing ClassStart responded to the survey. The Partial Least Squares method, a\nstatistics analysis technique based on the Structural Equation Model (SEM), was\nused to analyze the data. It was found that performance expectancy, social\ninfluence, information quality and system quality have the significant effect\non intention to use ClassStart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 15:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

Since the introduction of botnet, different design\nmethods have been employed to solve the divergent approach but the method of\ntaking over servers and client systems is unabated. To solve this, we first\nidentify Mpack, ICEpack and Fiesta as enhanced IRC tool. The analysis of its\nrole in data exchange using OSI model was carried out. This further gave the\nneeded proposal to the development of a High level architecture representing\nthe structural mechanism and the defensive mechanism within network server so\nas to control the botnet trend. Finally, the architecture was designed to\nrespond in a proactive state when scanning and synergizing the double data\nverification modules in an encapsulation manner within server system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 23:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}
