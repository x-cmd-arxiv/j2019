In order to\ndecrease computational complexity, one common strategy separates footstep\nplanning from motion optimization and plans contacts using heuristics. In this\npaper, we propose to learn contact schedule selection from high-level task\ndescriptors using Bayesian optimization. A bi-level optimization is defined in\nwhich a Gaussian process model predicts the performance of trajectories\ngenerated by a motion planning nonlinear program. The agent, therefore, retains\nthe ability to reason about suitable contact schedules, while explicit\ncomputation of the corresponding gradients is avoided. We delineate the\nalgorithm in its general form and provide results for planning single-legged\nhopping. Our method is capable of learning contact schedule transitions that\nalign with human intuition.

Informed robots are members of a\ngroup that selectively avoid the site/s where no aggregate should emerge, and\nstop only on the experimenter predefined site/s for aggregation. We study the\naggregation process with informed robots in three different scenarios: two that\nare morphologically symmetric, whereby the different types of aggregation site\nare equally represented in the environment; and an asymmetric scenario, whereby\nthe target site has an area that is half the area of the sites that should be\navoided. We first show what happens when no robot in the swarm is informed: in\nsymmetric environments, the swarm is able to break the symmetry and aggregates\non one of the two types of site at random, not necessarily on the target site,\nwhile in the asymmetric environment, the swarm tends to aggregate on the sites\nthat are most represented in terms of area. As a further valuable contribution\nof this study, we provide analytical results by studying a system of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations' (ODEs) that is an extension of a well known model.\nUsing this model, we show how, for certain values of the parameters, the model\ncan predict the dynamics observed with simulated robots in one of the two\nsymmetric scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 18:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

A detailed\nanalysis of line profile variations over the whole pulsation cycle is performed\nto understand the dynamical structure of the atmosphere.

The radiative stage of the shock wave is short: $4\\%$ of\nthe pulsation period ($0.892<\\varphi<0.929$). A Mach number $M>10$ is required\nto get such a radiative shock. The sodium layer reaches its maximum expansion\nwell before that of H$\\alpha$ ($\\Delta\\varphi=0.135$). Thus, a rarefaction wave\nis induced between the H$\\alpha$ and sodium layers. A strong atmospheric\ncompression occurring around $\\varphi=0.36$, which produces the third H$\\alpha$\nemission, takes place in the highest part of the atmosphere. The region located\nlower in the atmosphere where the sodium line is formed is not involved. The\namplification of gas turbulence seems mainly due to strong shock waves\npropagating in the atmosphere rather than to the global compression of the\natmosphere caused by the pulsation. It has not yet been clearly established\nwhether the microturbulence velocity increases or decreases with height in the\natmosphere. Furthermore, it seems very probable that an interstellar component\nis visible within the sodium profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 18:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 14:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

One approach to decrease urban\ntraffic congestion is to optimize the traffic signal behaviour in order to be\nadaptive to changes in the traffic conditions. From the perspective of\nintelligent transportation systems, this optimization problem is called the\ntraffic signal control problem and is considered a large combinatorial problem\nwith high complexity and uncertainty. A novel approach to the traffic signal\ncontrol problem is proposed in this thesis. The approach includes a new\nmechanism for Genetic Programming inspired by Epigenetics. Epigenetic\nmechanisms play an important role in biological processes such as phenotype\ndifferentiation, memory consolidation within generations and environmentally\ninduced epigenetic modification of behaviour. These properties lead us to\nconsider the implementation of epigenetic mechanisms as a way to improve the\nperformance of Evolutionary Algorithms in solution to real-world problems with\ndynamic environmental changes, such as the traffic control signal problem. The\nepigenetic mechanism proposed was evaluated in four traffic scenarios with\ndifferent properties and traffic conditions using two microscopic simulators.\nThe results of these experiments indicate that Genetic Programming was able to\ngenerate competitive actuated traffic signal controllers for all the scenarios\ntested. Furthermore, the use of the epigenetic mechanism improved the\nperformance of Genetic Programming in all the scenarios. The evolved\ncontrollers adapt to modifications in the traffic density and require less\nmonitoring and less human interaction than other solutions because they\ndynamically adjust the signal behaviour depending on the local traffic\nconditions at each intersection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 19:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

By using the TL, one can specify a wide range of temporal constraints on\nthe system and is widely used in cyber-physical systems. On the other hand,\nControl Barrier Functions have also gained interests in the context of safety\ncritical applications. However, most of the existing approaches only focus on\ndiscrete-time dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose an offline\ntrajectory planner for linear systems subject to safety and temporal\nspecifications. Such specifications can be expressed as logical junctions or\ndisjunctions of linear CBFs, or as STL specifications with linear predicates.\nOur planner produces trajectories that are valid in continuous time, while\nassuming only discrete-time control updates and arbitrary time interval in the\nSTL formula. Our planner is based on a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming\n(MIQP) formulation, where the linear STL predicates are encoded as set of\nlinear constraints to guarantee satisfaction at on a finite discrete set of\ntime instants, while we use CBFs to derive constraints that guarantee\ncontinuous satisfaction between time instants. Moreover, we have shown the\npredicates can be encoded as time-based CBF constraints for system with any\nrelative degrees.

On a range of visual navigation tasks, SMT demonstrates superior\nperformance to existing reactive and memory-based policies by a margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 22:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

The systems are charged particles periodically kicked by a\none-dimensional cosine potential in the presence of such fields, where the\nmagnetic field is perpendicular also to the kicking direction. We consider\nparameter values including small kicking strength, which enables the quantum\nevolution to be described by effective Floquet Hamiltonians. We also assume the\nsemiclassical regime of a small scaled Planck constant. In the case of an\nelectric field parallel to the kicking direction, one observes, as the\nelectric-field strength is varied, a series of topological phase transitions,\ncausing changes in the Chern numbers of quasienergy (QE) bands. These\ntransitions are due to band degeneracies which, in an initial wide range of\nelectric-field strengths, are shown to occur when the energy of the classical\nseparatrix is approximately equal to the average QE of the degenerating bands.\nFor larger electric-field strengths, the degeneracies reflect changes in the\nclassical phase-space structure. In the case of an electric field not parallel\nto the kicking direction and satisfying some resonance conditions, we show that\nthe topological properties of the QE bands are characterized by universal\n(electric-field independent) Chern numbers. These same numbers also\ncharacterize the QE band spectrum in the first case, at the end of the basic\nelectric-field interval where the topological phase transitions take place. The\ntwo cases above are known to exhibit significantly different dynamical rates,\nboth classical and quantum. This is well reflected by the different topological\nproperties in the two cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 22:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 11:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

To realize practical quantum computation, the\nfollowing three properties will be necessary: universality, scalability, and\nfault-tolerance. Universality is the ability to execute arbitrary multi-input\nquantum algorithms. Scalability means that computational resources such as\nlogical qubits can be increased without requiring exponential increase in\nphysical resources. Lastly, fault-tolerance is the ability to perform quantum\nalgorithms in presence of imperfections and noise. A promising approach to\nscalability was demonstrated with the generation of one-million-mode\n1-dimensional cluster state, a resource for one-input computation in\nmeasurement-based quantum computation (MBQC).

To this end, this paper\nproposes how a motivational psychology framework can be used effectively to\ndesign peer-to-peer energy trading to increase user participation. To do so,\nfirst, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer energy trading literature is\ndiscussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing\nstudies are identified. Second, a motivation psychology framework is\nintroduced, which consists of a number of motivational models that a prosumer\nneeds to satisfy before being convinced to participate in energy trading.\nThird, a game-theoretic peer-to-peer energy trading scheme is developed, its\nrelevant properties are studied, and it is shown that the coalition among\ndifferent prosumers is a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case\nstudies, it is shown that the proposed model can reduce carbon emissions by\n18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively compared to\na feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost\nof energy up to 118 cents and 87 cents per day in Summer and Winter\nrespectively. Finally, how the outcomes of the scheme satisfy all the\nmotivational psychology models is discussed, which subsequently shows its\npotential to attract users to participate in energy trading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 04:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

A\ncomplexity in fitting these models is the tuning of the parameters which\ncontrol the level of introduced sparsity through penalization. The most common\napproach to select the penalty parameter is through $k$-fold cross-validation.\nWhile cross-validation is used to minimise the empirical prediction error,\napproaches such as the $m$-out-of-$n$ paired bootstrap which use smaller\ntraining datasets provide consistency in selecting the non-zero coefficients in\nthe oracle model, performing well in an asymptotic setting but having\nlimitations when $n$ is small. In fact, for models such as the Lasso there is a\nmonotonic relationship between the size of training sets and the penalty\nparameter. We propose a generalization of these methods for selecting the\nregularization parameter based on a flexible-weighted bootstrap procedure that\nmimics the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap and overcomes its challenges for all sample\nsizes. Through simulation studies we demonstrate that when selecting a penalty\nparameter, the choice of weights in the bootstrap procedure can be used to\ndictate the size of the penalty parameter and hence the sparsity of the fitted\nmodel. We empirically illustrate our weighted bootstrap procedure by applying\nthe Lasso to integrate clinical and microRNA data in the modeling of\nAlzheimer's disease.

However, current\nvisual localization methods still struggle with environmental changes across\nweathers and seasons, as there is significant appearance variation between the\nmap and the query image. The crucial challenge in this situation is that the\npercentage of outliers, i.e. incorrect feature matches, is high. In this paper,\nwe derive minimal closed form solutions for 3D-2D localization with the aid of\ninertial measurements, using only 2 pairs of point matches or 1 pair of point\nmatch and 1 pair of line match. These solutions are further utilized in the\nproposed 2-entity RANSAC, which is more robust to outliers as both line and\npoint features can be used simultaneously and the number of matches required\nfor pose calculation is reduced. Furthermore, we introduce three feature\nsampling strategies with different advantages, enabling an automatic selection\nmechanism. With the mechanism, our 2-entity RANSAC can be adaptive to the\nenvironments with different distribution of feature types in different\nsegments.

In this paper, we propose\na cloud-based visual localization system targeting at long-term localization in\nreal time. On the robot, we employ two estimators to achieve accurate and\nreal-time performance. One is a sliding-window based visual inertial odometry,\nwhich integrates constraints from consecutive observations and self-motion\nmeasurements, as well as the constraints induced by localization on the cloud.\nThis estimator builds a local visual submap as the virtual observation which is\nthen sent to the cloud as new localization constraints. The other one is a\ndelayed state Extended Kalman Filter to fuse the pose of the robot localized\nfrom the cloud, the local odometry and the high-frequency inertial\nmeasurements. On the cloud, we propose a longer sliding-window based\nlocalization method to aggregate the virtual observations for larger field of\nview, leading to more robust alignment between virtual observations and the\nmap. Under this architecture, the robot can achieve drift-free and real-time\nlocalization using onboard resources even in a network with limited bandwidth,\nhigh latency and existence of package loss, which enables the autonomous\nnavigation in real-world environment.

Due to the small contact area\nand high relative velocities of bounding solids, the lubricant experiences\npressures in excess of 500 MPa and strain rates that are typically $10^5 -10^7$\n$\\textrm{s}^{-1}$. The high pressures lead to a dramatic rise in Newtonian\nviscosity $\\eta_{N}$ and the high rates lead to large shear stresses and\npronounced shear-thinning. This paper presents detailed simulations of a model\nEHL fluid, squalane, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods to extract\nthe scaling of its viscosity with shear rate ($10^5 - 10^{10}$\n$\\textrm{s}^{-1}$) over a wide range of pressure $P$ (0.1 MPa to 1.2 GPa), and\ntemperature $T$ ($150 - 373$ K). Simulation results are consistent with a broad\nrange of equilibrium and nonequilibrium experiments. At high $T$ and low $P$,\nwhere $\\eta_{N}$ is low, the response can be fit to a power-law, as in the\ncommon Carreau model. Shear-thinning becomes steeper as $\\eta_{N}$ increases,\nand for $\\eta_{N}\\gtrsim 1$ Pa-s, shear-thinning is consistent with the\nthermally activated flow assumed by another common model, Eyring theory.\nSimulations for a bi-disperse Lennard-Jones (LJ) system show that the\ntransition from Carreau to Eyring is generic. For both squalane and the LJ\nsystem, the viscosity decreases by only about a decade in the Carreau regime,\nbut may fall by many orders of magnitude in the Eyring regime. Shear thinning\nis often assumed to reflect changing molecular alignment, but the alignment of\nsqualane molecules saturates after the viscosity has dropped by only about a\nfactor of three. In contrast, thermal activation describes shear thinning by\nsix or more decades in viscosity. Changes in the diagonal elements of the\nstress tensor with rate and shear stress are also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 14:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

There are constructed new classes of exact and parametric solutions\nfor nonstationary configurations and locally anisotropic cosmological metrics\nin modified gravity theories and general relativity. Such solutions describe\nscenarios of nonlinear geometric evolution and gravitational and matter field\ndynamics with pattern-forming and quasiperiodic structure and various space\nquasicrystal and deformed spacetime crystal models. We analyze new classes of\ngeneric off-diagonal solutions for entropic gravity theories and show how such\nsolutions can be used for explaining structure formation in modern cosmology.\nFinally, we speculate why the approaches with Perelman-Lyapunov type\nfunctionals are more general or complementary to the constructions elaborated\nusing the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 04:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 08:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 20:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}
