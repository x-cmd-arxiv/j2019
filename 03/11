In this work, we propose a learning-based normal filtering scheme for\nmesh denoising called NormalNet, which maps the guided normal filtering (GNF)\ninto a deep network. The scheme follows the iterative framework of\nfiltering-based mesh denoising. During each iteration, first, the voxelization\nstrategy is applied on each face in a mesh to transform the irregular local\nstructure into the regular volumetric representation, therefore, both the\nstructure and face normal information are preserved and the convolution\noperations in CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) can be easily performed.\nSecond, instead of the guidance normal generation and the guided filtering in\nGNF, a deep CNN is designed, which takes the volumetric representation as\ninput, and outputs the learned filtered normals. At last, the vertex positions\nare updated according to the filtered normals. Specifically, the iterative\ntraining framework is proposed, in which the generation of training data and\nthe network training are alternately performed, whereas the ground truth\nnormals are taken as the guidance normals in GNF to get the target normals.\nCompared to state-of-the-art works, NormalNet can effectively remove noise\nwhile preserving the original features and avoiding pseudo-features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 16:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 11:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

This formula is the analog\nof the Baier-Katkov formula for the probability of radiation of one plane wave\nphoton with the quantum recoil taken into account. The derived formula is used\nto describe the radiation of twisted photons by charged particles in undulators\nand laser waves. Thus, the general theory of undulator radiation of twisted\nphotons and radiation of twisted photons in the nonlinear Compton process is\ndeveloped with account for the quantum recoil. The explicit formulas for the\nprobability to record a twisted photon are obtained in these cases. In\nparticular, we found that the quantum recoil and spin degrees of freedom\nincrease the radiation probability of twisted photons in comparison with the\nformula for scalar particles without recoil.

To\nmeaningfully interpret these lines, reliable atomic data are necessary. In work\npresented here we focused on low-lying fine-structure transitions, within the\nground term, due to electron impact. We provide effective collision strengths\ntogether with estimated uncertainties as functions of temperature of\nastrophysical importance ($10 - 100,000$ K). Due to the importance of\nfine-structure transitions within the ground term, the focus of this work is on\nobtaining accurate rate coefficients at the lower end of this temperature\nrange, for applications in low temperature environments such as the\ninterstellar medium. We performed three different flavours of scattering\ncalculations: i) a intermediate coupling frame transformation (ICFT) $R$-matrix\nmethod, ii) a Breit-Pauli (BP) $R$-matrix method, and iii) a Dirac $R$-matrix\nmethod. The ICFT and BP $R$-matrix calculations involved three different\nAUTOSTRUCTURE target models each. The Dirac $R$-matrix calculation was based on\na reliable 20 configuration, 6069 level atomic structure model. Good agreement\nwas found with our BP and Dirac $R$-matrix collision results compared to\nprevious $R$-matrix calculations.

A recent research direction in analyzing\nspatial data is to provide means for \"exploratory analysis\" of such data where\nanalysts are guided towards interesting options in consecutive analysis\niterations. Typically, the guidance component learns analyst's preferences\nusing her explicit feedback, e.g., picking a spatial point or selecting a\nregion of interest. However, it is often the case that analysts forget or don't\nfeel necessary to explicitly express their feedback in what they find\ninteresting. Our approach captures implicit feedback on spatial data. The\napproach consists of observing mouse moves (as a means of analyst's\ninteraction) and also the explicit analyst's interaction with data points in\norder to discover interesting spatial regions with dense mouse hovers.

The\ndiscussion addresses the issue of neutralized vs. non-neutralized currents in\nactive regions and concludes that MHD models are able to explain\nnon-neutralized currents in active regions by the existence of strong magnetic\nshear along the polarity inversion lines, thus confirming previous observations\nthat already contained this result. The models have also captured the essence\nof the behavior of electric currents in active regions during solar eruptions,\npredicting current-density increases and decreases inside flare ribbons and in\nthe interior of expanding flux ropes respectively.

During their fast\nexpansion, one fundamental determinant for success is the capability of\ndynamically predicting the demand of stations. In this paper we propose a novel\ndemand prediction approach, which is able to model the dynamics of the system\nand predict demand accordingly. We use a local temporal encoding process to\nhandle the available historical data at individual stations, and a spatial\nencoding process to take correlations between stations into account with graph\nconvolutional neural networks. The encoded features are fed to a prediction\nnetwork, which forecasts both the long-term expected demand of the stations.

The chains are studied given that there is an exceedance\nof a threshold, as the threshold tends to the upper endpoint of the\ndistribution. Unlike previous studies with $k>1$, we consider processes where\nstandard limit theory describes each extreme event as a single observation\nwithout any information about the transition to and from the body of the\ndistribution. Our work uses different asymptotic theory which results in\nnon-degenerate limit laws for such processes. We study the extremal properties\nof the initial distribution and the transition probability kernel of the Markov\nchain under weak assumptions for broad classes of extremal dependence\nstructures that cover both asymptotically dependent and asymptotically\nindependent Markov chains. For chains with $k>1$, the transition of the chain\naway from the exceedance involves novel functions of the $k$ previous states,\nin comparison to just the single value, when $k=1$. This leads to an increase\nin the complexity of determining the form of this class of functions, their\nproperties and the method of their derivation in applications. We find that it\nis possible to derive an affine normalization, dependent on the threshold\nexcess, such that non-degenerate limiting behaviour of the process is assured\nfor all lags. These normalization functions have an attractive structure that\nhas parallels to the Yule-Walker equations. Furthermore, the limiting process\nis always linear in the innovations.

Alternative to commercial used maps, the\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) data is a free open dataset, which makes it unique for the\nexploration research. This study is focused on two tasks that leverage OSM for\ndriving environment understanding. First, driving scenario attributes are\nretrieved from OSM elements, which are combined with vehicle dynamic signals\nfor the driving event recognition. Utilizing steering angle changes and based\non a Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN), a driving sequence is\nsegmented and classified as lane-keeping, lane-change-left, lane-change-right,\nturn-left, and turn-right events. Second, for autonomous driving perception,\nOSM data can be used to render virtual street views, represented as prior\nknowledge to fuse with vision/laser systems for road semantic segmentation.\nFive different types of road masks are generated from OSM, images, and Lidar\npoints, and fused to characterize the drivable space at the driver's\nperspective. An alternative data-driven approach is based on a Fully\nConvolutional Network (FCN), OSM availability for deep learning methods are\ndiscussed to reveal potential usage on compensating street view images and\nautomatic road semantic annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 00:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

These problems are resolved within an analytical\nframework by requiring that the wave-particle composite exhibits no observable\ndifferences with a quantum system. This scheme is implemented by appealing to\nsymmetries (global gauge and spacetime translations) and imposing equality of\nthe corresponding conserved Noether densities (matter, momentum and energy)\nwith their Schrodinger counterparts. In conjunction with the condition of time\nreversal covariance this implies the deBB law for the particle where the\nquantum potential mediates the wave-particle interaction (we also show how the\ntime reversal assumption may be replaced by a statistical condition). The\nmethod clarifies the nature of the mass of the composite, and its\nenergy-momentum conservation laws. Our principal result is the unification of\nthe Schrodinger equation and the deBB law in an inhomogeneous equation whose\nsolution amalgamates the wavefunction and a singular soliton model of the\nparticle in a unified spacetime field. The wavefunction suffers no reaction\nfrom the particle since it is the homogeneous part of the unified field to\nwhose source the particle contributes.

Due to the unordered structure of the strands, an\nimportant task in the decoding process is to place them in their correct order.\nThis is usually accomplished by allocating a part of the strand for an index.\nHowever, in the presence of errors in the index field, important information on\nthe order of the strands may be lost.\n  Clustering-correcting codes ensure that if the distance between the index\nfields of two strands is small, then there will be a large distance between\ntheir data fields.

The major goal is to examine\nthe validity of the adopted expansion scheme for an accurate description of\nfinite nuclei.

But BFT-based protocols\nsuffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the\nnetwork. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message\ncomplexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT\nperformance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message\ncomplexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes\nthe protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network\nwill face a a certain number of failures.\n  As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable\n(i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this\nissue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a\nsubset of nodes $c$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance,\nregardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the\nquadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to $O(cn)$, where\n$c<<n$, for large $n$.\n  Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when $c$ is\nasymptotically smaller than $n$, and this helps the protocol to provide stable\nperformance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our\nview change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the\nwhole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols.\nWe deployed and tested our protocol on $200$ Amazon $EC2$ instances, with two\ndifferent baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison.

In this paper, we model the overall return as\nindividual advertising effect in causal inference with multiple treatments and\nbound the expected estimation error with learnable factual loss and distance of\ntreatment-specific context distributions. Accordingly, a representation and\nhypothesis network is used to minimize the loss bound. We apply the learned\ncausal effect in the online bidding engine of an industry-level sponsored\nsearch system. Online experiments show that the causal inference based bidding\noutperforms the existing online bidding algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 07:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

This\nposes significant challenges in terms of Bayesian inference but more\nsignificantly in the design of experiments. Bayesian designs are found by\nmaximising the expectation of a utility function over a design space, and\ntypically this requires sampling from or approximating a large number of\nposterior distributions. This renders approaches adopted in inference\ncomputationally infeasible to implement in design. Consequently, optimal design\nin such fields has been limited to a small number of dimensions or a restricted\nrange of utility functions. To overcome such limitations, we propose a\nsynthetic likelihood-based Laplace approximation for approximating utility\nfunctions for models with intractable likelihoods. As will be seen, the\nproposed approximation is flexible in that a wide range of utility functions\ncan be considered, and remains computationally efficient in high dimensions. To\nexplore the validity of this approximation, an illustrative example from\nepidemiology is considered. Then, our approach is used to design experiments\nwith a relatively large number of observations in two motivating applications\nfrom epidemiology and ecology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 08:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Traditional approaches typically rely on estimators\nthat minimize the error over all possible compact convex sets; in particular,\nthese methods do not allow for the incorporation of prior structural\ninformation about the underlying set and the resulting estimates become\nincreasingly more complicated to describe as the number of measurements\navailable grows. We address both of these shortcomings by describing a\nframework for estimating tractably specified convex sets from support function\nevaluations. Building on the literature in convex optimization, our approach is\nbased on estimators that minimize the error over structured families of convex\nsets that are specified as linear images of concisely described sets -- such as\nthe simplex or the spectraplex -- in a higher-dimensional space that is not\nmuch larger than the ambient space. Convex sets parametrized in this manner are\nsignificant from a computational perspective as one can optimize linear\nfunctionals over such sets efficiently; they serve a different purpose in the\ninferential context of the present paper, namely, that of incorporating\nregularization in the reconstruction while still offering considerable\nexpressive power.

Following these works, we propose a\nnovel self-supervised deep model for estimating depth maps. Our framework\nexploits two main strategies: refinement via cycle-inconsistency and\ndistillation.

Then, a backward cycle network is\napplied to the generated image to re-synthesize back the input image,\nestimating the opposite disparity. A third network exploits the inconsistency\nbetween the original and the reconstructed input frame in order to output a\nrefined depth map. Finally, knowledge distillation is exploited, such as to\ntransfer information from the refinement network to the student.

Yet, simple and advanced models based\non SPP propagation sometimes fail to explain experimental results, even of\nbasic features as the LIPSS period. We experimentally demonstrate, for the\nparticular case of LIPSS on Cu, that significant deviations of the structure\nperiod from the predictions of the standard model are observed, which are very\npronounced for elevated angles of laser incidence.

The theoretical foundation of spectral distortions has seen major\nadvances in recent years, which highlight the immense potential of this\nemerging field. Spectral distortions probe a fundamental property of the\nUniverse - its thermal history - thereby providing additional insight into\nprocesses within the cosmological standard model (CSM) as well as new physics\nbeyond. Spectral distortions are an important tool for understanding inflation\nand the nature of dark matter. They shed new light on the physics of\nrecombination and reionization, both prominent stages in the evolution of our\nUniverse, and furnish critical information on baryonic feedback processes, in\naddition to probing primordial correlation functions at scales inaccessible to\nother tracers. In principle the range of signals is vast: many orders of\nmagnitude of discovery space could be explored by detailed observations of the\nCMB energy spectrum.

This microwave emission is highly dependent on many local plasma\nparameters, and the viewing angle. To correctly interpret observations,\ndetailed simulations of the emission are required. Additionally,\ngyrosynchrotron emission from the chromosphere has been largely ignored in\nmodelling efforts, and recent studies have shown the importance of thermal\nemission at millimetric wavelengths. Thyr is a new tool for modelling microwave\nemission from three-dimensional flaring loops with spatially varying atmosphere\nand increased resolution in the lower corona and chromosphere. Thyr is modular\nand open-source, consisting of separate components to compute the thermal and\nnon-thermal microwave emission coefficients and perform three-dimensional\nradiative transfer (in local thermodynamic equilibrium). The radiative transfer\nintegral is computed by a novel ray-marching technique to efficiently compute\nthe contribution of many volume elements. This technique can also be employed\non a variety of astrophysics problems. Herein we present a review of the theory\nof gyrosynchrotron radiation, and two simulations of identical flare loops in\nlow- and high-resolution performed with Thyr, with a spectral imaging analysis\nof differing regions. The high-resolution simulation presents a spectral\nhardening at higher frequencies. This hardening originates around the top of\nthe chromosphere due to the strong convergence of the magnetic field, and is\nnot present in previous models due to insufficient resolution. This hardening\ncould be observed with a coordinated flare observation from active radio\nobservatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 11:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

The existence of a linear\nframework with which to analyse nonlinear dynamical systems brings new\nstrategies for prediction and control, while the approach is straight-forward\nto apply to large datasets owing to a connection with dynamic mode\ndecomposition (DMD). However, it can be challenging to connect the output of\nDMD to a Koopman analysis since there are relatively few analytical results\navailable, while the DMD algorithm itself is known to struggle in situations\ninvolving the propagation of a localised structure through the domain.\nMotivated by these issues, we derive a series of Koopman decompositions for\nlocalised, finite-amplitude solutions of classical nonlinear PDEs. We first\ndemonstrate that nonlinear travelling wave solutions to both the Burgers and\nKdV equations have two Koopman decompositions; one of which converges upstream\nand another which converges the other downstream of the soliton or front. We\nthen use the inverse scattering transform to derive a full Koopman\ndecomposition for (pure soliton) solutions to the KdV equation, identifying\nKoopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and modes. Our analysis indicates that\nthere are many possible Koopman decompositions when the solution involves the\ninteraction of multiple solitons. The existence of multiple expansions in space\nand time has a critical impact on the ability of DMD to extract Koopman\neigenvalues and modes - which must be performed within a temporally and\nspatially localised window to correctly identify the separate expansions.

To this aim,\ntwo active grid protocols were considered. The first protocol is the standard\ntriple-random mode, where the grid motors are driven with random rotation rates\nand directions, which are changed randomly in time. This protocol has been\nextensively used due to its capacity to produce higher values of $Re_\\lambda$\nthan its passive counter part, with good statistical homogeneity and isotropy.\nThe second protocol was a static or open grid mode, where all grid blades were\ncompletely open, yielding the minimum blockage attainable with our grid.\nCentreline streamwise profiles were measured for both protocols and several\ninlet velocities. It was found that the turbulent flow generated with the\ntriple-random protocol evolved in the streamwise direction consistently with an\nenergy dissipation scaling of the form $\\varepsilon=C_\\varepsilon\nu^{\\prime3}/L$, with $C_\\varepsilon$ being a constant, $L$ the longitudinal\nintegral length-scale, and $u^\\prime$ the rms of the longitudinal velocity\nfluctuations. Conversely for the open-static grid, the energy dissipation\nfollowed a non-equilibrium turbulence scaling, namely, $C_\\varepsilon \\sim\nRe_G/Re_L$, where $Re_G$ is a global Reynolds number based on the inlet\nconditions of the flow, and $Re_L$ is based on the local properties of the flow\ndownstream the grid. Furthermore, this open-static grid mode scaling exhibits\nimportant differences with other grids, as the downstream location of the peak\nof turbulence intensity is a function of the inlet velocity. It was also found\nthat a rather simple theoretical model can predict the value of $C_\\varepsilon$\nbased on the number density of zero-crossings of the longitudinal velocity\nfluctuations. This theory is valid for both active grid operating protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 12:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 12:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

This\nphenomenon, called the principle of minimum differentiation, was captured by\nHotelling with a landmark model of spatial competition but is still the object\nof an ongoing scientific debate. Although consistently observed in practice,\nmany more realistic variants of Hotelling's model fail to support minimum\ndifferentiation or do not have pure equilibria at all. In particular, it was\nrecently proven for a generalized model which incorporates negative network\nexternalities and which contains Hotelling's model and classical selfish load\nbalancing as special cases, that the unique equilibria do not adhere to minimum\ndifferentiation. Furthermore, it was shown that for a significant parameter\nrange pure equilibria do not exist. We derive a sharp contrast to these\nprevious results by investigating Hotelling's model with negative network\nexternalities from an entirely new angle: approximate pure subgame perfect\nequilibria. This approach allows us to prove analytically and via agent-based\nsimulations that approximate equilibria having good approximation guarantees\nand that adhere to minimum differentiation exist for the full parameter range\nof the model.

It is\nconstructed using non-abelian extensions of $\\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebras.\nThe non-flat connection $(\\rho, E)$ is a finitely generated $\n\\tilde{U}^{\\otimes}(\\tilde{L},\\rho)$-module, hence we may speak of the\ncharacteristic variety $\\operatorname{Char}(\\rho,E)$ of $(\\rho, E)$ in the\nsense of $D$-modules. We may define the notion of holonomicity for non-flat\nconnections using the universal ring $ \\tilde{U}^{\\otimes}(\\tilde{L},\\rho)$.\nThis was previously done for flat connections. We also define cohomology and\nhomology of arbitrary non-flat connections. The cohomology and homology of a\nnon-flat connection $(\\rho,E)$ is defined using $\\operatorname{Ext}$ and\n$\\operatorname{Tor}$-groups of a non-Noetherian ring $\\operatorname{U}$. In the\ncase when the $A$-module $E$ is finitely generated we may always calculate\ncohomology and homology using a Noetherian quotient of $\\operatorname{U}$. This\nwas previously done for flat connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 13:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 12:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 08:08:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 11:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 11:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 12:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 15:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 12:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

However, the reconfigurable control of\ntranslational symmetry of crystalline structure is still challenging. High\npressure, as a powerful external control knob, provides a very promising route\nto circumvent this constraint. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a\npressure-controlled symmetry transition in layered InSe. The continuous and\nreversible evolution of structural symmetries can be in-situ monitored by using\nthe polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy. As\npressure changes, the reconfigurable symmetry transition of the SHG pattern\nfrom three-fold rotational symmetry to mirror symmetry was experimentally\nobserved in a layered InSe samples and was successfully explained by the\nproposed interlayer-translation model. This opens new routes towards potential\napplications of manipulating crystal symmetry of 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 14:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

One answer is the source-subtracted Cosmic Infrared\nBackground (CIB). The CIB is comprised of the collective light from all sources\nremaining after known, resolved sources are accounted for. Ever-more-sensitive\nsurveys will identify the brightest of these, allowing them to be removed, and\n- like peeling layers off an onion - reveal deeper layers of the CIB. In this\nway it is possible to measure the contributions from populations not accessible\nto direct telescopic observation. Measurement of fluctuations in the\nsource-subtracted CIB, i.e., the spatial power spectrum of the CIB after\nsubtracting resolved sources, provides a robust means of characterizing its\nfaint, and potentially new, populations. Studies over the past 15 years have\nrevealed source-subtracted CIB fluctuations on scales out to ~100' which cannot\nbe explained by extrapolating from known galaxy populations. Moreover, they\nappear highly coherent with the unresolved Cosmic X-ray Background, hinting at\na significant population of accreting black holes among the CIB sources.\nCharacterizing the source-subtracted CIB with high accuracy, and thereby\nconstraining the nature of the new populations, is feasible with upcoming\ninstruments and would produce critically important cosmological information in\nthe next decade. New coextensive deep and wide-area near-infrared, X-ray, and\nmicrowave surveys will bring decisive opportunities to examine, with high\nfidelity, the spatial spectrum and origin of the CIB fluctuations and their\ncross-correlations with cosmic microwave and X-ray backgrounds, and determine\nthe formation epochs and the nature of the new sources (stellar nucleosynthetic\nor accreting black holes).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 14:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Effects of small-scale magnetic fields are\nstudied in cases where the magnetic fields are self-consistently generated by a\nsmall-scale dynamo. The results show that small-scale magnetic fields lead to a\nquenching of the $\\Lambda$ effect which is milder than in cases where also a\nlarge-scale field is present. The effect of compressibility on the $\\Lambda$\neffect is negligible in the range of Mach numbers from 0.015 to 0.8. Density\nstratification induces a marked anisotropy in the turbulence and a vertical\n$\\Lambda$ effect if the forcing scale is roughly two times larger than the\ndensity scale height.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 15:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 18:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

This study aims to tackle its challenges and meet the substantial\nneed for generalization for OSV by examining different loss functions for\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). We adopt our new approach to OSV by asking\ntwo questions: 1. which classification loss provides more generalization for\nfeature learning in OSV? , and 2. How integration of different losses into a\nunified multi-loss function lead to an improved learning framework? These\nquestions are studied based on analysis of three loss functions, including\ncross entropy, Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, and hinge loss. According to\ncomplementary features of these losses, we combine them into a dynamic\nmulti-loss function and propose a novel ensemble framework for simultaneous use\nof them in CNN. Our proposed Multi-Loss Snapshot Ensemble (MLSE) consists of\nseveral sequential trials. In each trial, a dominant loss function is selected\nfrom the multi-loss set, and the remaining losses act as a regularizer.\nDifferent trials learn diverse representations for each input based on\nsignature identification task.

The key innovations are to use the fundamental no-arbitrage\ncondition as criterion function, to construct the most informative test assets\nwith an adversarial approach and to extract the states of the economy from many\nmacroeconomic time series. Our asset pricing model outperforms out-of-sample\nall benchmark approaches in terms of Sharpe ratio, explained variation and\npricing errors and identifies the key factors that drive asset prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 01:37:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 18:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 21:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 14:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 22:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 01:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

For all features of IoT to become fully functional in practice, there\nare several obstacles on the way to be surmounted and critical challenges to be\naddressed. These include, but are not limited to cybersecurity, data privacy,\nenergy consumption, and scalability. The Blockchain decentralized nature and\nits multi-faceted procedures offer a useful mechanism to tackle several of\nthese IoT challenges. However, applying the Blockchain protocols to IoT without\nconsidering their tremendous computational loads, delays, and bandwidth\noverhead can let to a new set of problems. This review evaluates some of the\nmain challenges we face in the integration of Blockchain and IoT technologies\nand provides insights and high-level solutions that can potentially handle the\nshortcomings and constraints of both IoT and Blockchain technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 14:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}
