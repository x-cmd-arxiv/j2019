Dissipative Kerr\nsolitons can form a rich variety of stable states, ranging from breathers to\nmultiple-soliton formations, among which, the recently discovered soliton\ncrystals stand out. They represent temporally-ordered ensembles of soliton\npulses, which can be regularly arranged by a modulation of the continuous-wave\nintracavity driving field. To date, however, the dynamics of soliton crystals\nremains mainly unexplored. Moreover, the vast majority of the reported crystals\ncontained defects - missing or shifted pulses, breaking the symmetry of these\nstates, and no procedure to avoid such defects was suggested. Here we explore\nthe dynamical properties of soliton crystals and discover that often-neglected\nchaotic operating regimes of the driven optical microresonator are the key to\ntheir understanding.

Driven by the high training cost of such\nmethods that can be unaffordable for a low-resource device, training sparse\nneural networks sparsely from scratch has recently gained attention. However,\nexisting sparse training algorithms suffer from various issues, including poor\nperformance in high sparsity scenarios, computing dense gradient information\nduring training, or pure random topology search. In this paper, inspired by the\nevolution of the biological brain and the Hebbian learning theory, we present a\nnew sparse training approach that evolves sparse neural networks according to\nthe behavior of neurons in the network. Concretely, by exploiting the cosine\nsimilarity metric to measure the importance of the connections, our proposed\nmethod, Cosine similarity-based and Random Topology Exploration (CTRE), evolves\nthe topology of sparse neural networks by adding the most important connections\nto the network without calculating dense gradient in the backward. We carried\nout different experiments on eight datasets, including tabular, image, and text\ndatasets, and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art sparse training algorithms in extremely sparse neural networks\nby a large gap.

First, humans' behavior is\nhard to model or infer, as it may reflect biases, long term memory, and\nsensitivity to sequencing, i.e., transience and exponential complexity in the\nlength of the interaction. Second, due to the interactive nature of such\nprocesses, the machine policy used to engage with a human may bias possible\ndata-driven inferences. Finally, in choosing machine policies that optimize\ninteraction rewards, one must, on the one hand, avoid being overly sensitive to\nerror/variability in the estimated human model, and on the other, being overly\ndeterministic/predictable which may result in poor human 'engagement' in the\ninteraction.

By grouping homogeneous pixels, the accuracy can be\nincreased and the decrease of the number of elements to process can drastically\nreduce the computational burden. For most superpixel methods, a trade-off is\ncomputed between 1) color homogeneity, 2) adherence to the image contours and\n3) shape regularity of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a framework\nthat jointly enforces all these aspects and provides accurate and regular\nSuperpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP). During the\ndecomposition, we propose to consider color features along the linear path\nbetween the pixel and the corresponding superpixel barycenter. A contour prior\nis also used to prevent the crossing of image boundaries when associating a\npixel to a superpixel. Finally, in order to improve the decomposition accuracy\nand the robustness to noise, we propose to integrate the pixel neighborhood\ninformation, while preserving the same computational complexity. SCALP is\nextensively evaluated on standard segmentation dataset, and the obtained\nresults outperform the ones of the state-of-the-art methods. SCALP is also\nextended for supervoxel decomposition on MRI images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 23:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Researchers and practitioners are\nincreasingly aware that verification tools can be impactful if they embrace\nchange through analyses that are compositional and span program versions.\nReasoning about similarities and differences between programs goes back to\nBenton, who introduced state-based refinement relations, which were extended by\nYang and others. However, to our knowledge, refinement relations have not been\nexplored for traces.\n  We present a novel theory that allows one to perform compositional reasoning\nabout the similarities/differences between how fragments of two different\nprograms behave over time through the use of what we call trace-refinement\nrelations. We take a reactive view of programs and found Kleene Algebra with\nTests (KAT) [Kozen] to be a natural choice to describe traces since it permits\nalgebraic reasoning and has built-in composition. Our theory involves a\ntwo-step semantic abstraction from programs to KAT, and then our trace\nrefinement relations correlate behaviors by (i) categorizing program behaviors\ninto trace classes through KAT intersection and (ii) correlating atomic\nevents/conditions across programs with KAT hypotheses. We next describe a\nsynthesis algorithm that iteratively constructs trace-refinement relations\nbetween two programs by exploring sub-partitions of their traces, iteratively\nabstracting them as KAT expressions, discovering relationships through a custom\nedit-distance algorithm, and applying strategies (i) and (ii) above. We have\nimplemented this algorithm as {\\sc knotical}, the first tool capable of\nsynthesizing trace-refinement relations. It built from the ground up in Ocaml,\nusing InterProc and SymKAT.

Secondly, we develop the kinematics and dynamics observer\nsuch that the overall observer error dynamics possesses a stability property.\nFinally, the proposed observer is validated through robust Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and experiments on a robotic facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 02:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Grouped data contains information\non frequencies of some pre-specified groups in each area, for example the\nnumbers of households in the income classes, and thus provides more detailed\ninsight about small areas than area-level aggregated data. A direct application\nof the widely used small area methods, such as the Fay-Herriot model for\narea-level data and nested error regression model for unit-level data, is not\nappropriate since they are not designed for grouped data. The newly proposed\nmethod adopts the multinomial likelihood function for the grouped data. In\norder to connect the group probabilities of the multinomial likelihood and the\nauxiliary variables within the framework of small area estimation, we introduce\nthe unobserved unit-level quantities of interest which follows the linear mixed\nmodel with the random intercepts and dispersions after some transformation.\nThen the probabilities that a unit belongs to the groups can be derived and are\nused to construct the likelihood function for the grouped data given the random\neffects. The unknown model parameters (hyperparameters) are estimated by a\nnewly developed Monte Carlo EM algorithm using an efficient importance\nsampling. The empirical best predicts (empirical Bayes estimates) of small area\nparameters can be calculated by a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm.

The functional approach enables us,\nmoreover, to determine the smallest set of steering nodes that need to be\nactuated to ensure target controllability, where these steering nodes are\nconstrained to belong to a given set. We show that such a smallest set can be\nfound in polynomial time. We are also able to classify the possible actuated\nvariables in terms of their importance with respect to the functional target\ncontrollability problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 06:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 11:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

It provides a powerful and innovative insight to\nanalyze the structure and growth of the real city. In order to understand the\nshape and growth of urban agglomerations in Switzerland from spatial and\ntemporal aspects, this work identifies urban clusters from nighttime light data\nand street network data.

The head/tail\nbreaks is a classification method to find the hierarchy of data with a\nheavy-tailed distribution.

The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges\nfor designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph.

Since an\nunknown number of rocky exoplanets may operate in a one-plate convective\nregime, i.e., without plate tectonics, we aim at understanding under which\nconditions planets in such a stagnant-lid regime may support habitable surface\nconditions. Understanding the interaction of the planetary interior and\noutgassing of volatiles with the atmosphere in combination with the evolution\nof the host star is crucial to determine the potential habitability. M-dwarf\nstars in particular possess a high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase which\nendangers the habitability of planets around them via water loss. We therefore\nexplore the potential of secondary outgassing from the planetary interior to\nrebuild a water reservoir allowing for habitability at a later stage. We\ncompute the boundaries of the habitable zone around M, K, G, and F-dwarf stars\nusing a 1D cloud-free radiative-convective climate model accounting for the\noutgassing history of CO2 and H2O from an interior evolution and outgassing\nmodel for different interior compositions and stellar luminosity evolutions.\nThe outer edge of the habitable zone strongly depends on the amount of CO2\noutgassed from the interior, while the inner edge is mainly determined via the\nstellar irradiation, as soon as a sufficiently large water reservoir has been\noutgassed. A build-up of a secondary water reservoir for planets around M-dwarf\nstars is possible even after severe water loss during the high luminosity\npre-main sequence phase as long as some water has been retained within the\nmantle. Earth-like stagnant-lid planets allow for habitable surface conditions\nwithin a continuous habitable zone that is dependent on interior composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 08:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The results indicate that in general the\n$\\alpha$ preformation probabilities of even-$Z$, odd-$N$ nuclei are slightly\nsmaller than the odd-$Z$, even-$N$ ones. We found that the odd-even staggering\neffect may play a more important role on spontaneous fission than $\\alpha$\ndecay. The calculated half-lives can well reproduce the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 08:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

So far, four mutations in the gelsolin gene have been reported as\nresponsible for the disease. Although D187N is the first identified variant and\nthe best characterized, its structure has been hitherto elusive. Exploiting a\nrecently-developed nanobody targeting gelsolin, we were able to stabilize the\nG2 domain of the D187N protein and obtained, for the first time, its\nhigh-resolution crystal structure. In the nanobody-stabilized conformation, the\nmain effect of the D187N substitution is the impairment of the calcium binding\ncapability, leading to a destabilization of the C-terminal tail of G2. However,\nmolecular dynamics simulations show that in the absence of the nanobody,\nD187N-mutated G2 further misfolds, ultimately exposing its hydrophobic core and\nthe furin cleavage site. The nanobody's protective effect is based on the\nenhancement of the thermodynamic stability of different G2 mutants (D187N,\nG167R and N184K). In particular, the nanobody reduces the flexibility of\ndynamic stretches, and most notably decreases the conformational entropy of the\nC-terminal tail, otherwise stabilized by the presence of the Ca2+ ion. A\nCaenorhabditis elegans-based assay was also applied to quantify the proteotoxic\npotential of the mutants and determine whether nanobody stabilization\ntranslates into a biologically relevant effect.

However, the network decisions are often\nperceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these\nalgorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise\nrelevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions\nfor AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP\nproduces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of\neach voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to\nsusceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation (\"Which change in voxels\nwould change the outcome most?\"), the LRP method is able to directly highlight\npositive contributions to the network classification in the input space. In\nparticular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals\n(\"Why does this person have AD?\") with high inter-patient variability, (2)\nthere is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that\nexhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature.\nTo quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed\nrelevance per brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although\nthese metrics produce very individual \"fingerprints\" of relevance patterns for\nAD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including\nthe hippocampus.

Rather\nthan a model, the DeePC algorithm solely needs input/output data measured from\nthe unknown system to predict future trajectories. We show that the DeePC can\neliminate undesired oscillations in a grid-connected power converter and\nstabilize an unstable system. However, the DeePC algorithm may suffer from poor\nscalability when applied in high-order systems. To this end, we present a\nfinite-horizon output-based model predictive control (MPC) for grid-connected\npower converters, which uses an N-step auto-regressive-moving-average (ARMA)\nmodel for system representation. The ARMA model is identified via an N-step\nprediction error method (PEM) in a recursive way. We investigate the connection\nbetween the DeePC and the concatenated PEM-MPC method, and then analytically\nand numerically compare their closed-loop performance. Moreover, the PEM-MPC is\napplied in a voltage source converter based HVDC station which is connected to\na two-area power system so as to eliminate low-frequency oscillations.

The trapezoidal surface is supposed to\nconsist of two horizontal half-lines pointing oppositely, and a single finite\nvertical line segment connecting their endpoints, which can be regarded as a\nnon-local perturbation of a straight line. For incident plane waves, we enforce\nthat the scattered wave, post-subtracting reflected plane waves by the two half\nlines of the scattering surface in certain two regions respectively, satisfies\nan integral form of Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity. With this new\nradiation condition, we prove uniqueness and existence of weak solutions by a\ncoupling scheme between finite element and integral equation methods. This\nconsequently indicates that our new radiation condition is sharper than the\nAngular Spectrum Representation, and has generalized the radiation condition\nfor scattering problems in a locally perturbed half-plane.\n  Furthermore, we develop a numerical mode matching method based on this new\nradiation condition. A perfectly matched layer is setup to absorb outgoing\nwaves at infinity. Since the medium composes of two horizontally uniform\nregions, we expand, in either uniform region, the scattered wave in terms of\neigenmodes and match the mode expansions on the common interface between the\ntwo uniform regions, which in turn gives rise to numerical solutions to our\nproblem.

The\nnew outcomes benefit from the findings reported in a recent\nfinite-difference-scheme paper [Shiroto & Sentoku, arXiv:1902.07866] which we\ngeneralize to the finite-element method. This note focuses solely on the direct\ndiscretization of the collision operator, leaving the discretization of the\nunderlying metriplectic formulation of the relativistic collision operator to\nfuture publications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 12:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

However, the performance of this\ndecoder is limited both by unavoidable $4$-cycles in the code's factor graph\nand the degenerate nature of quantum errors. For the subclass of CSS codes, the\nnumber of $4$-cycles can be reduced by breaking an error into an $X$ and $Z$\ncomponent and decoding each with an individual $\\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder.\nHowever, this comes at the expense of ignoring potential correlations between\nthese two error components. We present a number of modified belief propagation\ndecoders that address these issues. We propose a $\\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder\nfor CSS codes that reintroduces error correlations by reattempting decoding\nwith adjusted error probabilities. We also propose the use of an augmented\ndecoder, which has previously been suggested for classical binary low-density\nparity-check codes. This decoder iteratively reattempts decoding on factor\ngraphs that have a subset of their check nodes duplicated. The augmented\ndecoder can be based on a $\\mathrm{GF}(4)$ decoder for any code, a\n$\\mathrm{GF}(2)$ decoder for CSS code, or even a supernode decoder for a\ndual-containing CSS code. For CSS codes, we further propose a $\\mathrm{GF}(2)$\nbased decoder that combines the augmented decoder with error probability\nadjustment. We demonstrate the performance of these new decoders on a range of\ndifferent codes, showing that they perform favorably compared to other decoders\npresented in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 12:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 10:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

A classical result of Alth\\\"ofer\net al. is that for every integer $k$ and every graph $G$, there is a\n$(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$ with at most $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. But for some\nsettings the more interesting notion is not the number of edges, but the\ndegrees of the nodes. This spurred interest in and study of spanners with small\nmaximum degree. However, this is not necessarily a robust enough objective: we\nwould like spanners that not only have small maximum degree, but also have\n\"few\" nodes of \"large\" degree. To interpolate between these two extremes, in\nthis paper we initiate the study of graph spanners with respect to the\n$\\ell_p$-norm of their degree vector, thus simultaneously modeling the number\nof edges (the $\\ell_1$-norm) and the maximum degree (the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm).\nWe give precise upper bounds for all ranges of $p$ and stretch $t$: we prove\nthat the greedy $(2k-1)$-spanner has $\\ell_p$ norm of at most $\\max(O(n),\nO(n^{(k+p)/(kp)}))$, and that this bound is tight (assuming the Erd\\H{o}s girth\nconjecture). We also study universal lower bounds, allowing us to give\n\"generic\" guarantees on the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm which\ngeneralize and interpolate between the known approximations for the $\\ell_1$\nand $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm. Finally, we show that at least in some situations,\nthe $\\ell_p$ norm behaves fundamentally differently from $\\ell_1$ or\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$: there are regimes ($p=2$ and stretch $3$ in particular) where\nthe greedy spanner has a provably superior approximation to the generic\nguarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 13:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

In this model the role of doping\nconsists in only a local change in the electronic structures of the parent\nphases of cuprates and ferropnictides due to the formation of trion complexes\ncomprising a doped carrier localized in unit cell and charge transfer (CT)\nexcitons around it. These CT excitons emerge in CuO4 or AsFe4 plaquettes in the\nCuO2 or FeAs basal planes (CT plaquettes) under the influence of doped carrier,\nrestricting its itinerancy. As the dopant concentration is increased, CT\nplaquettes combine into clusters of the so called CT phase. It is this CT phase\nthat is related in the model to the HTSC phase. In support of this assumption,\nwe determined the ranges of dopant concentrations conforming to the existence\nof percolation clusters of the CT phase; these ranges were shown to coincide\nwith the positions of the superconducting domes on the phase diagrams of these\ncompounds. The model also perfectly describes subtle features of the phase\ndiagrams of various cuprates and ferropnictides including the 1/8 anomaly,\nnarrow peaks in the dependences of the London penetration depth on the\nconcentration of the dopant, and other specific features. The mechanism of the\ngeneration of free carriers in the CT phase, provided by intrinsic self-doping,\nwas considered. The mechanism is not directly related to external doping, but\nis due to the interaction of band electrons with so called Heitler-London (HL)\ncentres inherently existing in the percolation cluster of CT phase and\nrepresenting pairs of adjacent CuO4 or AsFe4 CT plaquettes in the CuO2 or FeAs\nbasal planes. Material in CT phase was shown to represent a medium, in which\nthe mechanism of excitonic superconductivity, specified by the interaction of\nband electrons with HL centres, can be realized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 13:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 15:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 14:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

However, existing fusion methods often produce\nunclear fused images when input images do not have a sufficient number of\ndifferent exposure levels.

The kinematics of the outflowing gas are strongly\nlinked to the type of ionization mechanism: regions characterized by LIER\nemission host outflows with more extreme kinematics (FWHM_broad ~900 km/s),\nfollowed by those originated in AGN (~550 km/s), `Intermediate' (~450 km/s) and\nSF (~350 km/s) regions.

We find a trend for higher outflow kinematics towards\nlarger stellar masses of the host galaxies but no significant variation as a\nfunction of star formation. The fraction of outflowing gas that can escape from\ngalaxies decreases towards higher dynamical masses, contributing to the\npreservation of the mass-metallicity relation by regulating the amount of\nmetals in galaxies.

To constrain the\nduration of a global-scale Earth MO we have built and applied a 1D interior\nmodel coupled alternatively with a grey H2O/CO2 atmosphere or with a pure H2O\natmosphere treated with a line-by-line model described in a companion paper by\nKatyal et al.

While the corresponding unit cell\nvolume follows Vegard's law in accordance with the different ionic radii of the\nionic substitutions, the bandgap values depict non-linear compositional\ndependences for all the solid solutions. The effect is considerably large for\nBaZrxTi1-xO3 and BaSnxTi1-xO3 solutions, depicting a bandgap linear\ncompositional dependence up to x=0.6, for x>0.6 BaZrxTi1-xO3 compounds present\nmuch larger bandgap values than BaSnxTi1-xO3 counterparts. Electronic\nproperties have been investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in\nBaSnxTi1-xO3 compounds, indicating that the Sn 3d and Ti 2p core levels shift\nagainst the Ba 3d ones within the whole compositional range with the same\nenergy trend as that observed for the optical bandgap. Since for Ba1-x SrxTiO3\ncompounds no major bandgap variation is observed, we conclude that the bandgap\ncompositional dependences observed for BaSnxTi1-xO3 compounds and BaZrxTi1-xO3\nones are originated from the structural sensitivity of the O, Ti and Sn or Zr\nelectronic bands involved in the bandgap transition of these compounds.

The results for the Wigner rotation in the Lorentz lab\nframe obtained by many experts on special relativity such as Moeller and\nJackson, are incorrect. They overestimate the angle of the Wigner rotation by a\nfactor $\\gamma$ compared to its real value, and the direction of the rotation\nis also determined incorrectly. In 1959, Bargman, Michel, and Telegdi (BMT)\nproposed a consistent relativistic theory for the dynamics of the spin as\nobserved in the lab frame, which was successfully tested in experiments. The\nBMT equation naturally involves the Wigner rotation as the purely kinematic\naddition to the Larmor rotation which, in turn, is a consequence of interaction\nof the intrinsic magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. It is\ncommonly believed that the BMT equation contains the standard (and incorrect)\nresult for the Wigner rotation in the Lorentz lab frame. The existing textbooks\nthen suggest that the experimental test of the BMT equation is a direct proof\nof validity for the standard expression for Wigner rotation. Here we focus on\nthe analysis of the reason why authors of textbooks obtained an incorrect\nexpression for the Wigner rotation. We demonstrate that the notion that the\nstandard (incorrect) result for the Wigner rotation as an integral part of the\nBMT equation in most texts is based, in turn, on an incorrect physical\nargument. The aim of the present paper is to analyze the complicated situation\nrelating to the use of the theory of relativity and, in particular, Wigner\nrotation theory, in accelerator physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 13:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

A\nprogram for column generation always includes a module that solves a linear\nequation. In this paper, we address three major issues in solving linear\nproblem during column generation procedure which are (1) how to employ the\nsparse property of the coefficient matrix; (2) how to reduce the size of the\ncoefficient matrix; and (3) how to reuse the solution to a similar equation. To\nthis end, we first analyze the sparse property of coefficient matrix of linear\nequations and find that the matrices occurring in iteration are very sparse.\nThen, we present an algorithm locSolver (for localized system solver) for\nlinear equations with sparse coefficient matrices and right-hand-sides. This\nalgorithm can reduce the number of variables. After that, we present the\nalgorithm incSolver (for incremental system solver) which utilizes similarity\nin the iterations of the program for a linear equation system. All three\ntechniques can be used in column generation of multi-commodity problems.\nPreliminary numerical experiments show that the incSolver is significantly\nfaster than the existing algorithms. For example, random test cases show that\nincSolver is at least 37 times and up to 341 times faster than popular solver\nLAPACK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 14:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

This amounts to estimating the evidence for several\nbiologically informed models of neurovascular coupling using variational\nBayesian methods and selecting the most plausible explanation using Bayesian\nmodel comparison. First, fMRI data is used to localise active neuronal sources.\nThe coordinates of neuronal sources are then used as priors in the\nspecification of a DCM for MEG, in order to estimate the underlying generators\nof the electrophysiological responses. The ensuing estimates of neuronal\nparameters are used to generate neuronal drive functions, which model the pre\nor post synaptic responses to each experimental condition in the fMRI paradigm.\nThese functions form the input to a model of neurovascular coupling, the\nparameters of which are estimated from the fMRI data. This establishes a\nBayesian fusion technique that characterises the BOLD response - asking, for\nexample, whether instantaneous or delayed pre or post synaptic signals mediate\nhaemodynamic responses. Bayesian model comparison is used to identify the most\nplausible hypotheses about the causes of the multimodal data. We illustrate\nthis procedure by comparing a set of models of a single-subject auditory fMRI\nand MEG dataset. Our exemplar analysis suggests that the origin of the BOLD\nsignal is mediated instantaneously by intrinsic neuronal dynamics and that\nneurovascular coupling mechanisms are region-specific.

In particular, the critical forces for surface and\nline defects scale with the radius of precipitates to the second and first\npower, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 15:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 16:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

However, the property of\nnormalization (and therefore the one of soundness) was only conjectured. The\ndifficulty for the proof of normalization is due to the simultaneous presence\nof dependent types (for the constructive part of the choice), of control\noperators (for classical logic), of coinductive objects (to encode functions of\ntype ${\\mathbb{N} \\to A}$ into streams (${a_0},{a_1},...$)) and of lazy\nevaluation with sharing (for memoizing these coinductive objects). Elaborating\non previous works, we introduce in this paper a variant of dPA${^\\omega}$\npresented as a sequent calculus.

The smallest kiln\n(SK, 0.2 m 3) cooled in around 12 hours and the biggest kiln (BK, 8 m 3) in\naround 40 hours. Thermomagnetic, hysteresis and backfield curves indicated that\nthe main magnetic carriers were Ti-poor titanomagnetites and\nTipoortitanohematites. The fraction of the TRM carried by Ti-poor\ntitanohematites is the maindifference between the two sets of bricks. This\nfraction is around 5-10% in bricks from BK kilnand up to 40% in those from SK\nkiln.

Consequently, the strain this is\nplaces on health and social care services means providing 24-hour monitoring is\nnot sustainable. Technological intervention is being considered, however no\nsolution exists to non-intrusively monitor the independent living needs of\npatients with dementia. As a result many patients hit crisis point before\nintervention and support is provided. In parallel, patient care relies on\nfeedback from informal carers about significant behavioural changes. Yet, not\nall people have a social support network and early intervention in dementia\ncare is often missed. The smart meter rollout has the potential to change this.\nUsing machine learning and signal processing techniques, a home energy supply\ncan be disaggregated to detect which home appliances are turned on and off.\nThis will allow Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) to be assessed, such as\neating and drinking, and observed changes in routine to be detected for early\nintervention. The primary aim is to help reduce deterioration and enable\npatients to stay in their homes for longer. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and\nRandom Decision Forest classifier are modelled using data from three test\nhomes. The trained models are then used to monitor two patients with dementia\nduring a six-month clinical trial undertaken in partnership with Mersey Care\nNHS Foundation Trust. In the case of load disaggregation for appliance\ndetection, the SVM achieved (AUC=0.86074, Sen=0.756 and Spec=0.92838). While\nthe Decision Forest achieved (AUC=0.9429, Sen=0.9634 and Spec=0.9634). ADLs are\nalso analysed to identify the behavioural patterns of the occupant while\ndetecting alterations in routine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 11:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

Existing\nmodels typically rely on top-down language information and learn attention\nimplicitly by optimizing the captioning objectives. While somewhat effective,\nthe learned top-down attention can fail to focus on correct regions of interest\nwithout direct supervision of attention. Inspired by the human visual system\nwhich is driven by not only the task-specific top-down signals but also the\nvisual stimuli, we in this work propose to use both types of attention for\nimage captioning. In particular, we highlight the complementary nature of the\ntwo types of attention and develop a model (Boosted Attention) to integrate\nthem for image captioning.
