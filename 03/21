They were common by the time the Universe is several Gyr old, and many\nof them were in place within the first 1~Gyr after the Big Bang. Their quick\nassembly has been attributed to mechanisms such as the rapid collapse of gas\ninto the nuclei of early protogalaxies, accretion and mergers of stellar-mass\nBHs accompanying structure formation at early times, and the runaway collapse\nof early, ultra-dense stellar clusters. The origin of the early massive BHs\nremains an intriguing and long-standing unsolved puzzle in astrophysics. Here\nwe discuss strategies for discerning between BH seeding models using\nelectromagnetic observations. We argue that the most direct answers will be\nobtained through detection of BHs with masses M<10^5 Msun at redshifts z>10,\nwhere we expect them to first form. Reaching out to these redshifts and down to\nthese masses is crucial, because BHs are expected to lose the memory of their\ninitial assembly by the time they grow well above 10^5 Msun and are\nincorporated into higher-mass galaxies. The best way to detect 10^4-10^5 Msun\nBHs at high redshifts is by a sensitive X-ray survey. Critical constraining\npower is augmented by establishing the properties and the environments of their\nhost galaxies in deep optical/IR imaging surveys. Required OIR data can be\nobtained with the JWST and WFIRST missions. The required X-ray flux limits\n(down to 10^{-19} erg/s/cm^2) are accessible only with a next-generation X-ray\nobservatory which has both high (sub-1\") angular resolution and high\nthroughput. A combination of deep X-ray and OIR surveys will be capable of\nprobing several generic markers of the BH seed scenarios, and resolving the\nlong-stanging puzzle of their origin. These electromagnetic observations are\nalso highly synergistic with the information from LISA on high-z BH mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 16:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

Here, we present a new acceleration algorithm\nbased on adaptive and heterogeneous scaling of reaction rates and\nstoichiometric coefficients. The algorithm is conceptually related to the\ncommonly used idea of accelerating a stochastic simulation by considering a\nsub-volume $\\lambda \\Omega$ ($0<\\lambda<1$) within a system of interest, which\nreduces the number of reaction events per unit time occurring in a simulation\nby a factor $1/\\lambda$ at the cost of greater error in unbiased estimates of\nfirst moments and biased overestimates of second moments. Our new approach\noffers two unique benefits. First, scaling is adaptive and heterogeneous, which\neliminates the pitfall of overaggressive scaling. Second, there is no need for\nan \\emph{a priori} classification of populations as discrete or continuous (as\nin a hybrid method), which is problematic when discreteness of a chemical\nspecies changes during a simulation. The method requires specification of only\na single algorithmic parameter, $N_c$, a global critical population size above\nwhich populations are effectively scaled down to increase simulation\nefficiency. The method, which we term partial scaling, is implemented in the\nopen-source BioNetGen software package.

Starting from a\ntheoretical description we derive a scheme for photon emission from an emitter\ncoupled to a birefringent cavity that exceeds hitherto anticipated limitations.\nBased on a recent study and experimental investigation of the intra-cavity\ncoupling of orthogonal polarisation modes in birefringent cavities, we now\ndecouple the emitter and the photon prior to emission from the cavity mode.\nEffectively, this is \"hiding\" the emitter from the photon in the cavity to\nsuppress re-excitation, increasing the overall emission through the cavity\nmirrors. In doing so we show that tailored cavity birefringence can offer\nsignificant advantages and that these are practically achievable within the\nbounds of present-day technology. It is found that birefringence can mitigate\nthe tradeoff between stronger emitter-cavity coupling and efficient photon\nextraction. This allows for longer cavities to be constructed without a loss of\nperformance -- a significant result for applications where dielectric mirrors\ninterfere with any trapping fields confining the emitter. We then generalise\nour model to consider a variety of equivalent schemes. For instance, detuning a\npair of ground states in a three-level emitter coupled to a cavity in a\nLambda-system is shown to provide the same enhancement, and it can be combined\nwith a birefringent cavity to further increase performance. Additionally, it is\nfound that when directly connecting multiple ground states of the emitter to\nform a chain of coupled states, the extraction efficiency approaches its\nfundamental upper limit. The principles proposed in this work can be applied in\nmultiple ways to any emitter-cavity system, paving the way to surpassing the\ntraditional limits of such systems with technologies that exist today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 17:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 08:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The focus is on\nthe optimal decentralized control (ODC) problem, whose feasible set is recently\nshown to have an exponential number of connected components and consequently an\nexponential number of local minima. The rich literature of numerical algorithms\nfor nonlinear optimization suggests that if a local search algorithm is\ninitialized in an arbitrary connected component of the feasible set, it would\nsearch only within that component and find a stationary point there. This is\nbased on the fact that numerical algorithms are designed to generate a sequence\nof points (via searching for descent directions and adjusting the step size),\nwhose corresponding continuous path is trapped in a single connected component.\nIn contrast with this perception rooted in convex optimization, we numerically\nillustrate that local search methods for non-convex constrained optimization\ncan obliviously jump between different connected components to converge to a\nglobal minimum, via an aggressive step size adjustment using backtracking and\nthe Armijio rule. To support the observations, we prove that from almost every\narbitrary point in any connected component of the feasible set, it is possible\nto generate a sequence of points using local search to jump to different\ncomponents and converge to a global solution. However, due to the NP-hardness\nof the problem, such fine-tuning of the parameters of a local search algorithm\nmay need prior knowledge or be time consuming.

In this\nmodel, AGN dominate the HI ionizing background at z<~3 and star-forming\ngalaxies dominate it at higher redshifts. Combined with the steeply declining\nAGN luminosity function beyond z~2, the slow evolution of the HI ionization\nrate inferred from the high-redshift HI Lya forest requires an escape fraction\nfrom star-forming galaxies that increases with redshift (a population-averaged\nescape fraction of ~1% suffices to ionize the intergalactic medium at z=3 when\nincluding the contribution from AGN). We provide effective photoionization and\nphotoheating rates calibrated to match the Planck 2018 reionization optical\ndepth and recent constraints from the HeII Lya forest in hydrodynamic\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 14:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

We\nconsider two types of boxes: square and circle. In a square-shaped 2D box trap,\nwhen the number of generated vortices is the square of an integer, the vortices\nare found to be arranged in a perfect square lattice, although deviations near\nthe center are found when the number of generated vortices is arbitrary. In\ncase of a circular box trap, the generated vortices in the rapidly rotating BEC\nlie on concentric closed orbits. Near the center, these orbits have the shape\nof polygons, whereas near the periphery the orbits are circles. The circular\nbox trap is equivalent to the rotating cylindrical bucket used in early\nexperiment(s) with liquid He II. The number of generated vortices in both cases\nis in qualitative agreement with Feynman's universal estimate. The numerical\nsimulation for this study is performed by a solution of the underlying\nmean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in the rotating frame, where the wave\nfunction for the generated vortex lattice is a stationary state. Consequently,\nthe imaginary-time propagation method can be used for a solution of the GP\nequation, known to lead to an accurate numerical solution. We also demonstrated\nthe dynamical stability of the vortex lattices in real-time propagation upon a\nsmall change of the angular frequency of rotation, using the converged\nimaginary-time wave function as the initial state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

For example, dense deep neural network embedding vectors\nare often used in conjunction with sparse textual features to provide high\ndimensional hybrid representation of documents. Efficient search in such hybrid\nspaces is very challenging as the techniques that perform well for sparse\nvectors have little overlap with those that work well for dense vectors.\nPopular techniques like Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its data-dependent\nvariants also do not give good accuracy in high dimensional hybrid spaces.

The current study seeks\nto investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that\ncombines network analysis of student enrolment data with an interpretive lens\nbased on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of\ncourses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014)\nto quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We explore the properties of this\nnetwork to investigate gender differences in transverse movements (between\ndifferent academic fields) and vertical movements (changes in students'\nachievement rankings within a field). Our findings indicate that female\nstudents are more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields.\nWe also find that university physics does a poor job in attracting high\nachieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the\nstudents who do choose to study physics, low achieving female students are less\nlikely to continue than their male counterparts. The results and implications\nare discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We\nargue that in order to remove constraints on female student's study choices,\nthe field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like\nthey belong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 20:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The results from\nperfect model scenarios show that data assimilation changes and, more often\nthan not, improves the model state. Data from Swarm-A, Swarm-C, CHAMP, and\nGRACE-A are used to validate the resulting analysis states. The independent\nvalidation results show that the Ne-guided thermosphere state does not\noutperform the model state without data assimilation along the considered\norbits. This may be due to the limited number of bonafide Ne profiles available\nfor the thermosphere specification tasks in the experiments. More importantly,\nthe results show that the Ne-guided thermosphere state does not deteriorate\nmuch in performance during geomagnetic storm time.

This very common phenomenon violates\nthe fundamental assumption underpinning nearly all enterprise experimentation\nsystems, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). When this\nassumption is broken, a typical experimentation platform, which relies on\nBernoulli randomization for assignment and two-sample t-test for assessment of\nsignificance, will not only fail to account for the network effect, but\npotentially give highly biased results.\n  This paper outlines a simple and scalable solution to measuring network\neffects, using ego-network randomization, where a cluster is comprised of an\n\"ego\" (a focal individual), and her \"alters\" (the individuals she is\nimmediately connected to). Our approach aims at maintaining representativity of\nclusters, avoiding strong modeling assumption, and significantly increasing\npower compared to traditional cluster-based randomization. In particular, it\ndoes not require product-specific experiment design, or high levels of\ninvestment from engineering teams, and does not require any changes to\nexperimentation and analysis platforms, as it only requires assigning treatment\nan individual level. Each user either has the feature or does not, and no\ncomplex manipulation of interactions between users is needed. It focuses on\nmeasuring the one-out network effect (i.e the effect of my immediate\nconnection's treatment on me), and gives reasonable estimates at a very low\nsetup cost, allowing us to run such experiments dozens of times a year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 21:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

The gas mass obtained from traditional\ntracers, such as dust thermal continuum and CO isotopologues, are now known to\nhave significant (1 - 2 orders of magnitude) discrepancies. Emission from the\nisotopologue of H2, hydrogen deuteride (HD), offers an alternative measurement\nof the disk gas mass.\n  Of all of the regions of the spectrum, the far-infrared stands out in that\norders of magnitude gains in sensitivity can be gleaned by cooling a large\naperture telescope to 8 K.

Here, we\nintroduce a novel technique, interpreting a trained neural network by\ninvestigating its flip points. A flip point is any point that lies on the\nboundary between two output classes: e.g. for a neural network with a binary\nyes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal scores for \"yes\"\nand \"no\". The flip point closest to a given input is of particular importance,\nand this point is the solution to a well-posed optimization problem. This paper\ngives an overview of the uses of flip points and how they are computed. Through\nresults on standard datasets, we demonstrate how flip points can be used to\nprovide detailed interpretation of the output produced by a neural network.\nMoreover, for a given input, flip points enable us to measure confidence in the\ncorrectness of outputs much more effectively than softmax score. They also\nidentify influential features of the inputs, identify bias, and find changes in\nthe input that change the output of the model. We show that distance between an\ninput and the closest flip point identifies the most influential points in the\ntraining data. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and rank-revealing QR\nfactorization (RR-QR), the set of directions from each training input to its\nclosest flip point provides explanations of how a trained neural network\nprocesses an entire dataset: what features are most important for\nclassification into a given class, which features are most responsible for\nparticular misclassifications, how an adversary might fool the network, etc.\nAlthough we investigate flip points for neural networks, their usefulness is\nactually model-agnostic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 01:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

This suggests that the central regions of AGN host\ngalaxies have characteristically lower mass-to-light ratios than inactive\ngalaxies, most likely due to the presence of a younger stellar population in\nactive systems. In addition, the degree of luminosity excess appears to be\nproportional to the accretion rate of the AGN, revealing a physical connection\nbetween stellar growth and black hole growth.

Here, we present a\ntimeline that relates variably retentive radiometric ages from asteroidal\nmeteorites, to new dynamical models of late accretion that invokes giant planet\nmigration. Reconciliation of the geochronological data with dynamical models\nshows that giant planet migration immediately leads to an intense 30 Myr influx\nof comets to the entire solar system. The absence of whole-sale crustal reset\nages after 4450 Ma for the most resilient chronometers from Earth, Moon, Mars,\nVesta and various meteorite parent bodies confines the onset of giant planet\nmigration to no later than ca. 4480 Ma. Waning impacts from planetesimals,\nasteroids (and a minor cometary component) continue to strike the inner planets\nthrough a protracted monotonic decline in impactor flux; this is in agreement\nwith predictions from crater chronology.

Slice sampling is well-known for its desirable\nproperties including its fast mixing and its natural potential for\nparallelization. On the other hand, the hierarchical nature of HDPs poses\nchallenges to adopting a full-fledged slice sampler that automatically\ntruncates all the infinite measures involved without ad-hoc modifications. In\nthis work, we adopt the powerful idea of Bayesian variable augmentation to\naddress this challenge. By introducing new latent variables, we obtain a full\nfactorization of the joint distribution that is suitable for slice sampling.\nOur algorithm has several appealing features such as (1) fast mixing; (2)\nremaining exact while allowing natural truncation of the underlying\ninfinite-dimensional measures, as in (Kalli et al., 2011), resulting in updates\nof only a finite number of necessary atoms and weights in each iteration; and\n(3) being naturally suited to parallel implementations.

In this work, we propose a geometry-aware\n3D representation for the human pose to address this limitation by using\nmultiple views in a simple auto-encoder model at the training stage and only 2D\nkeypoint information as supervision. A view synthesis framework is proposed to\nlearn the shared 3D representation between viewpoints with synthesizing the\nhuman pose from one viewpoint to the other one. Instead of performing a direct\ntransfer in the raw image-level, we propose a skeleton-based encoder-decoder\nmechanism to distil only pose-related representation in the latent space. A\nlearning-based representation consistency constraint is further introduced to\nfacilitate the robustness of latent 3D representation. Since the learnt\nrepresentation encodes 3D geometry information, mapping it to 3D pose will be\nmuch easier than conventional frameworks that use an image or 2D coordinates as\nthe input of 3D pose estimator.

This builds on a series of\nconstructions by the authors on geometric and computational aspects of twisted\ndifferential K-theory, which to a large extent were originally motivated by\nthis problem. In addition to providing a new conceptual framework and a\nmathematically solid setting, this allows us to uncover interesting and novel\neffects. Explicitly, we use our recently constructed Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral\nsequence (AHSS) for twisted differential K-theory to characterize the RR fields\nand their quantization, which involves interesting interplay between geometric\nand topological data. We illustrate this with the examples of spheres, tori,\nand Calabi-Yau threefolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 06:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

We do not find evidence for any GW signals. We place limits on the\nbroadband GW flux emitted at 25~Hz from point sources with a power law spectrum\nat $F_{\\alpha,\\Theta} <(0.05-25)\\times 10^{-8} ~{\\rm\nerg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}\\,Hz^{-1}}$ and the (normalized) energy density spectrum in\nGWs at 25 Hz from extended sources at $\\Omega_{\\alpha}(\\Theta)\n<(0.19-2.89)\\times 10^{-8} ~{\\rm sr^{-1}}$ where $\\alpha$ is the spectral index\nof the energy density spectrum. These represent improvements of $2.5-3\\times$\nover previous limits. We also consider point sources emitting GWs at a single\nfrequency, targeting the directions of Sco X-1, SN 1987A, and the Galactic\nCenter.

We use a dynamic triangular aperture that can\nbe programmed to have different characteristic R to diffract beams of various\nOAM values.

For a constant initial waist w in the spatial light\nmodulator and a constant position z of the aperture system, we find that the\nradius of the aperture is unique for each m value. Interestingly, this R scales\naccording to the literature-reported beam's rms radius. We also show that with\nlarger aperture, a smearing effect can be seen in the diffraction patterns\nwhich becomes a setback on discerning fringes for the measurement of the\ntopological charge value and thus of the OAM of light.

IGA is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of\nthe volumetric spline representation of the object. Typically, tensor-product\nB-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric domain. A general\n3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically\nrepresented using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality\nof the contemporary B-rep modeling space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi\nand Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates volumetric elements.\nHowever, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more\ndifficult since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly\nchallenging task. In this work, we propose an algorithm that precisely\ndecomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular only on the\nboundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify\nthe integration process in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first\nsubdivided into a set of trimmed B\\'ezier trivariates, at all its internal\nknots.

Resource management plays a key role in\nmaximizing resource utilization and application performance in mobile ad hoc\nclouds. Unlike resource management in traditional distributed computing\nsystems, such as clouds, resource management in a mobile ad hoc cloud poses\nnumerous challenges owing to the node mobility, limited battery power, high\nlatency, and the dynamic network environment. The real-time requirements\nassociated with mobile cyber-physical system applications make the problem even\nmore challenging. Currently, existing resource management systems for mobile ad\nhoc clouds are not designed to support mobile cyber-physical system\napplications and energy-efficient communication between application tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose a new energy-efficient resource management system for\nmobile ad hoc clouds. The proposed system consists of two layers: a network\nlayer and a middleware layer. The network layer provides ad hoc network and\ncommunication services to the middleware layer and shares the collected\ninformation in order to allow efficient and robust resource management\ndecisions. It uses (1) a transmission power control mechanism to improve energy\nefficiency and network capacity, (2) link lifetimes to reduce communication and\nenergy consumption costs, and (3) link quality to estimate data transfer times.\nThe middleware layer is responsible for the discovery, monitoring, migration,\nand allocation of resources. It receives application tasks from users and\nallocates tasks to nodes on the basis of network and node-level information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 13:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

The experimental spin-flip and momentum scattering rates\nand their dependence on the density of fluorine and carrier doping are obtained\nthrough weak localization and conductivity measurements, respectively, and\nsuggest the role of fluorine as resonant magnetic impurities. For the estimated\nfluorine concentration of a few 100 ppm, the observed spin lifetimes are in the\nrange of 1-10\\,ps. Theoretically, we established tight-binding electronic\nstructures of fluorinated graphene and bilayer graphene by fitting to density\nfunctional supercell calculations and performed a comprehensive analysis of the\nspin-flip and momentum scattering rates within the same devices, aiming to\ndevelop a consistent description of both scattering channels. We find that\nresonant scattering in graphene is very sensitive to the precise position of\nthe resonance level, as well as to the magnitude of the exchange coupling\nbetween itinerant carriers and localized spins. The experimental data point to\nthe presence of weak spin-flip scatterers that, at the same time, relax the\nelectron momentum strongly, nearly preserving the electron-hole symmetry. Such\nscatterers would exhibit resonance energies much closer to the neutrality point\nthan what density functional theory predicts in the dilute limit. The inclusion\nof a magnetic moment on fluorine adatoms allowed us to qualitatively capture\nthe carrier density dependence of the experimental rates but predicts a greater\n(weaker) spin (momentum) relaxation rate than the measurements.

This invokes a need to equip the affected people and the emergency\nresponders with the ability to rapidly set up and use independent means of\ncommunication. Therefore, in this work, we present a complete end-to-end\nsolution that can connect survivors of a disaster with each other and the\nauthorities using a completely self-sufficient ad hoc network that can be setup\nrapidly. Accordingly, we develop a Heterogeneous Efficient Low Power Radio\n(HELPER) that acts as an access point for end-users to connect using custom\nwebsite application. These HELPERs then coordinate with each other to form a\nLoRa based ad hoc network. To this end, we propose a novel cross-layer\noptimized distributed energy-efficient routing (SEEK) algorithm that aims to\nmaximize the network lifetime.

The Narrow Angle Camera is particularly useful for studying the\nevolution in Anhur in terms of morphological changes and color\nvariations.}{Radiance factor images processed by the OSIRIS pipeline were\ncoregistered, reprojected onto the 3D shape model of the comet, and corrected\nfor the illumination conditions. We find a number of morphological changes in\nthe Anhur region that are related to formation of new scarps; removal of dust\ncoatings; localized resurfacing in some areas, including boulders\ndisplacements; and vanishing structures, which implies localized mass loss that\nwe estimate to be higher than 50 million kg. The strongest changes took place\nin and nearby the Anhur canyon-like structure, where significant dust cover was\nremoved, an entire structure vanished, and many boulders were rearranged. All\nsuch changes are potentially associated with one of the most intense outbursts\nregistered by Rosetta during its observations, which occurred one day before\nperihelion passage. Moreover, in the niche at the foot of a new observed scarp,\nwe also see evidence of water ice exposure that persisted for at least six\nmonths. The abundance of water ice, evaluated from a linear mixing model, is\nrelatively high (> 20%). Our results confirm that the Anhur region is\nvolatile-rich and probably is the area on 67P with the most pristine exposures\nnear perihelion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In this regard, we propose a monocular vision\nassisted localization algorithm, that will help a UAV to navigate safely in\nindoor corridor environments. Always, the aim is to navigate the UAV through a\ncorridor in the forward direction by keeping it at the center with no\norientation either to the left or right side. The algorithm makes use of the\nRGB image, captured from the UAV front camera, and passes it through a trained\ndeep neural network (DNN) to predict the position of the UAV as either on the\nleft or center or right side of the corridor. Depending upon the divergence of\nthe UAV with respect to the central bisector line (CBL) of the corridor, a\nsuitable command is generated to bring the UAV to the center. When the UAV is\nat the center of the corridor, a new image is passed through another trained\nDNN to predict the orientation of the UAV with respect to the CBL of the\ncorridor. If the UAV is either left or right tilted, an appropriate command is\ngenerated to rectify the orientation. We also propose a new corridor dataset,\nnamed NITRCorrV1, which contains images as captured by the UAV front camera\nwhen the UAV is at all possible locations of a variety of corridors. An\nexhaustive set of experiments in different corridors reveal the efficacy of the\nproposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

In this article, we propose an approximate\nBayes approach --- treating the similarity matrices generated over the views as\nrough first-stage estimates for the co-assignment probabilities; in its\nKullback-Leibler neighborhood, we obtain a refined low-rank matrix, formed by\nthe pairwise product of simplex coordinates.

However these approaches reach their limits when compressible\neffects are important in the high Mach flow regime, e.g. in stellar atmospheres\nor in the presence of accretion shocks. In order to tackle these issues, we\npropose a new high performance and portable code, called \"ARK\" with a numerical\nsolver well-suited for the stratified compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We\ntake a finite volume approach with machine precision conservation of mass,\ntransverse momentum and total energy. Based on previous works in applied\nmathematics we propose the use of a low Mach correction to achieve a good\nprecision in both low and high Mach regimes. The gravity source term is\ndiscretized using a well-balanced scheme in order to reach machine precision\nhydrostatic balance. This new solver is implemented using the Kokkos library in\norder to achieve high performance computing and portability across different\narchitectures (e.g. multi-core, many-core, and GP-GPU). We show that the\nlow-Mach correction allows to reach the low-Mach regime with a much better\naccuracy than a standard Godunov-type approach. The combined well-balanced\nproperty and the low-Mach correction allowed us to trigger Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nconvective modes close to the critical Rayleigh number. Furthermore we present\n3D turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection with low diffusion using the low-Mach\ncorrection leading to a higher kinetic energy power spectrum.

This effect is\nusually interpreted either as the gravitational interaction among circumbinary\nbodies and the host binary -- known as the light travel time (LTT) effect -- or\nas the quadrupole moment variations in one magnetic active component -- known\nas Applegate mechanism. In this study, we present an analysis of the ETV and\nthe magnetic cycle of the close binary KIC 10544976. This system is composed of\na white dwarf and a red dwarf in a short orbital period (0.35 days) and was\nmonitored by ground-based telescopes between 2005 and 2017 and by the Kepler\nsatellite between 2009 and 2013. Using the Kepler data, we derived the magnetic\ncycle of the red dwarf by two ways: the rate and energy of flares and the\nvariability due to spots. Both methods resulted in a cycle of ~600 days, which\nis in agreement with magnetic cycles measured for single low-mass stars. The\norbital period of KIC 10544976 shows only one long-term variation which can be\nfitted by an LTT effect with period of ~16.8 yr. Hence, one possible\nexplanation for the ETVs is the presence of a circumbinary body with minimal\nmass of ~13.4 M_Jup. In the particular scenario of coplanarity between the\nexternal body and the inner binary, the third body mass is also ~13.4 M_Jup. In\nthis case, the circumbinary planet must either have survived the evolution of\nthe host binary or have been formed as a consequence of its evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}
