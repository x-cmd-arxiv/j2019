This work extends the effective aperture size by coherently\ncompounding the received radio frequency data from multiple transducers. A\nframework is developed in which an ultrasound imaging system consisting of $N$\nsynchronized matrix arrays, each with partly shared field of view, take turns\nto transmit plane waves. Only one individual transducer transmits at each time\nwhile all $N$ transducers simultaneously receive. The subwavelength\nlocalization accuracy required to combine information from multiple transducers\nis achieved without the use of any external tracking device. The method\ndeveloped in this study is based on the study of the backscattered echoes\nreceived by the same transducer and resulting from a targeted scatterer point\nin the medium insonated by the multiple ultrasound probes of the system. The\ncurrent transducer locations along with the speed of sound in the medium are\ndeduced by optimizing the cross-correlation between these echoes. The method is\ndemonstrated experimentally in 2-D using ultrasound point and anechoic lesion\nphantoms and a first demonstration of a free-hand experiment is also shown.\nResults demonstrate that the coherent multi-transducer imaging has the\npotential to improve ultrasound image quality, improving resolution and target\ndetectability.

To show the\neffectiveness and validity of our system for prosthesis training, we conducted\na 10-day study with able-bodied subjects (N = 3) to see the effect that\ntraining on the HoloPHAM had on other established functional outcome measures.\nA washout phase of 5 days was incorporated to observe the effect without\ntraining. Comparisons were made with standardized outcome metrics, along with\nthe progression of kinematic variability over time. Statistically significant\n(p<0.05) improvements were observed between pre- and post-training stages. Our\nresults show that AR can be an effective tool for prosthesis training with\npattern recognition systems, fostering motor learning for reaching movement\ntasks, and paving the possibility of replacing physical training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 18:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

We define the\nLBE directly from the particle data within an adaptive spherical shell, and\ndevise a Gaussian mixture estimator to separate background particles from\npreviously unidentified subhalo particles. Analyzing the LBE properties, we\nfind that the LBE of satellite galaxies is not at rest with respect to their\nhost halo, in contrast to typical assumptions. The orientations of the\nvelocities of a subhalo and its LBE are well aligned in the outer infall\nregions of haloes, but decorrelated near halo center.

Therefore, we\nuse the time-evolving LBE of galaxies to develop a method to better account for\nram-pressure stripping within the Munich semi-analytical model, L-Galaxies.\nOverall, our new approach results in a significant increase in gas stripping\nacross cosmic time.

The transition is driven by an applied magnetic field and involves no\nchange in the symmetry of the state.

Existing multiplex centrality measures typically rank nodes\nassuming the layers are qualitatively similar. Many real systems, however, are\ncomprised of networks heterogeneous in nature, for example, social networks may\nhave both agnostic and affiliative layers. Here, we use rank aggregation\nmethods to identify intervention targets in multiplex networks when the\nstructure, the dynamics, and our intervention goals are qualitatively different\nfor each layer. Our approach is to rank the nodes separately in each layer\nconsidering their different function and desired outcome, and then we use Borda\ncount or Kemeny aggregation to identify a consensus ranking - top nodes in the\nconsensus ranking are expected to effectively balance the competing goals\nsimultaneously among all layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of consensus\nranking, we apply our method to a degree-based node removal procedure such that\nwe aim to destroy the largest component in some layers, while maintaining\nlarge-scale connectivity in others. For any multi-objective intervention,\noptimal targets only exist in the Pareto-sense; we, therefore, use a weighted\ngeneralization of consensus ranking to investigate the trade-off between the\ncompeting objectives.

An\nemulator provides a fast approximation of such functions relying on a limited\nnumber of evaluations. Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonplace emulators due\nto their statistical properties such as the ability to estimate their own\nuncertainty. GPs are essentially developed to fit smooth, continuous functions.\nHowever, the assumptions of continuity and smoothness is unwarranted in many\nsituations. For example, in computer models where bifurcations or tipping\npoints occur, the outputs can be discontinuous. This work examines the capacity\nof GPs for emulating step-discontinuous functions. Several approaches are\nproposed for this purpose. Two special covariance functions/kernels are adapted\nwith the ability to model discontinuities. They are the neural network and\nGibbs kernels whose properties are demonstrated using several examples. Another\napproach, which is called warping, is to transform the input space into a new\nspace where a GP with a standard kernel, such as the Matern family, is able to\npredict the function well. The transformation is perform by a parametric map\nwhose parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. The results show that the\nproposed approaches have superior performance to GPs with standard kernels in\ncapturing sharp jumps in the true function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 21:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 13:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

Then, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP)\nalgorithm is used to find the entries of the unknown mmWave MIMO channel\nmatrix.

Recent years has\nseen a surge of successes solving challenging games and smaller domain\nproblems, including simple though non-specific robotic manipulation and\ngrasping tasks. Rapid successes in RL have come in part due to the strong\ncollaborative effort by the RL community to work on common, open-sourced\nenvironment simulators such as OpenAI's Gym that allow for expedited\ndevelopment and valid comparisons between different, state-of-art strategies.\nIn this paper, we aim to start the bridge between the RL and the surgical\nrobotics communities by presenting the first open-sourced reinforcement\nlearning environments for surgical robots, called dVRL[3]{dVRL available at\nhttps://github.com/ucsdarclab/dVRL}. Through the proposed RL environments,\nwhich are functionally equivalent to Gym, we show that it is easy to prototype\nand implement state-of-art RL algorithms on surgical robotics problems that aim\nto introduce autonomous robotic precision and accuracy to assisting,\ncollaborative, or repetitive tasks during surgery. Learned policies are\nfurthermore successfully transferable to a real robot. Finally, combining dVRL\nwith the over 40+ international network of da Vinci Surgical Research Kits in\nactive use at academic institutions, we see dVRL as enabling the broad surgical\nrobotics community to fully leverage the newest strategies in reinforcement\nlearning, and for reinforcement learning scientists with no knowledge of\nsurgical robotics to test and develop new algorithms that can solve the\nreal-world, high-impact challenges in autonomous surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 22:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

It is assumed that the dynamics\nof a quadrotor is disturbed by arbitrary, unstructured forces and moments\ncaused by wind. To address this, the proposed control system is augmented with\nmultilayer neural networks, and the weights of neural networks are adjusted\nonline according to an adaptive law. By utilizing the universal approximation\ntheorem, it is shown that the effects of unknown disturbances can be mitigated.\nMore specifically, under the proposed control system, the tracking errors in\nthe position and the heading direction are uniformly ultimately bounded where\nthe ultimate bound can be reduced arbitrarily. These are developed directly on\nthe special Euclidean group to avoid complexities or singularities inherent to\nlocal parameterizations. The efficacy of the proposed control system is first\nillustrated by numerical examples. Then, several indoor flight experiments are\npresented to demonstrate that the proposed controller successfully rejects the\neffects of wind disturbances even for aggressive, agile maneuvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 22:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

In order to\ninterpret these observations, we use a Pluto volatile transport model able to\nsimulate the cycles of N2 and CH4 ices over millions of years. By assuming\nfixed solid mixing ratios, we explore how changes in surface albedos,\nemissivities and thermal inertias impact volatile transport. This work is\ntherefore a direct and natural continuation of the work by Bertrand et al.\n(2018), which only explored the N2 cycles. Results show that bright CH4\ndeposits can create cold traps for N2 ice outside Sputnik Planitia, leading to\na strong coupling between the N2 and CH4 cycles. Depending on the assumed\nalbedo for CH4 ice, the model predicts CH4 ice accumulation (1) at the same\nequatorial latitudes where the Bladed Terrain Deposits are observed, supporting\nthe idea that these CH4-rich deposits are massive and perennial, or (2) at\nmid-latitudes (25{\\deg}N-70{\\deg}N), forming a thick mantle which is consistent\nwith New Horizons observations. In our simulations, both CH4 ice reservoirs are\nnot in an equilibrium state and either one can dominate the other over long\ntimescales, depending on the assumptions made for the CH4 albedo. This suggests\nthat long-term volatile transport exists between the observed reservoirs. The\nmodel also reproduces the formation of N2 deposits at mid-latitudes and in the\nequatorial depressions surrounding the Bladed Terrain, as observed by New\nHorizons. At the poles, only seasonal CH4 and N2 deposits are obtained in\nPluto's current orbital configuration. Finally, we show that Pluto's atmosphere\nalways contained, over the last astronomical cycles, enough gaseous CH4 to\nabsorb most of the incoming Lyman-flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 22:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

In this paper, we propose an automatic sleep stage annotation\nmethod called SleepEEGNet using a single-channel EEG signal. The SleepEEGNet is\ncomposed of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract time-invariant\nfeatures, frequency information, and a sequence to sequence model to capture\nthe complex and long short-term context dependencies between sleep epochs and\nscores. In addition, to reduce the effect of the class imbalance problem\npresented in the available sleep datasets, we applied novel loss functions to\nhave an equal misclassified error for each sleep stage while training the\nnetwork. We evaluated the proposed method on different single-EEG channels\n(i.e., Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz EEG channels) from the Physionet Sleep-EDF datasets\npublished in 2013 and 2018. The evaluation results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieved the best annotation performance compared to current\nliterature, with an overall accuracy of 84.26%, a macro F1-score of 79.66% and\nCohen's Kappa coefficient = 0.79. Our developed model is ready to test with\nmore sleep EEG signals and aid the sleep specialists to arrive at an accurate\ndiagnosis.

For these settings we propose subgradient iterative\nalgorithms with random minibatch feasibility updates.

Boosting signed link prediction necessitates\nadditional information to compensate for data sparsity. According to psychology\ntheories, one rich source of such information is user's personality such as\noptimism and pessimism that can help determine her propensity in establishing\npositive and negative links. In this study, we investigate how personality\ninformation can be obtained, and if personality information can help alleviate\nthe data sparsity problem for signed link prediction. We propose a novel signed\nlink prediction model that enables empirical exploration of user personality\nvia social media data.

Modern imaging\nmethods have proven successful at extracting such information. However, in\norder to analyze this type of data, neuronal morphology needs to be encoded in\na graph-theoretic method. This encoding enables the use of high throughput\ninformatic methods to extract and infer brain function. The application of\ngraph-theoretic methods to neuronal morphological representation comes with\ncertain difficulties. Here we report a novel, effective method to accomplish\nthis task.\n  The morphology of a neuron, which consists of its overall size, global shape,\nlocal branch patterns, and cell-specific biophysical properties, can vary\nsignificantly with the cell's identity, location, as well as developmental and\nphysiological state. Various algorithms have been developed to customize shape\nbased statistical and graph related features for quantitative analysis of\nneuromorphology, followed by the classification of neuron cell types using the\nfeatures. Unlike the classical feature extraction based methods from imaged or\n3D reconstructed neurons, we propose a model based on the rooted path\ndecomposition from the soma to the dendrites of a neuron and extract\nmorphological features on each path. We hypothesize that measuring the distance\nbetween two neurons can be realized by minimizing the cost of continuously\nmorphing the set of all rooted paths of one neuron to another. To validate this\nclaim, we first establish the correspondence of paths between two neurons using\na modified Munkres algorithm. Next, an elastic deformation framework that\nemploys the square root velocity function is established to perform the\ncontinuous morphing, which, in addition, provides an effective visualization\ntool.

Single-layer PtN$_2$ has also been\npredicted to show semiconducting behavior with direct band gaps. Full\nexploration of the structure-property relationship awaits the successful\nexfoliation or synthesis of this novel single-layer material, which depends on\nthe structure of its bulk counterpart with the same stoichiometry to some\nextent. Bulk PtN$_2$ with the pyrite structure is commonly regarded as the most\nstable structure in the literature. But comparing the energies of single-layer\nPtN$_2$ and bulk PtN$_2$ leads to a dilemma that a single-layer material is\nmore stable than its bulk counterpart. To solve this dilemma, we propose\nstacking single-layer PtN$_2$ sheets infinitely to form a new bulk structure of\nPtN$_2$. The resulting tetrahedral layered structure is energetically more\nstable than the pyrite structure and single-layer PtN$_2$. We also find that\nthe predicted bulk structure is metallic, in contrast to the semiconducting\npyrite structure. In addition to predicting the 3D structure, we explore the\npossibility of rolling single-layer PtN$_2$ sheets into nanotubes. The required\nenergies are comparable to those needed to form carbon or boron nitride\nnanotubes from their single-layer sheets, implying the feasibility of obtaining\nPtN$_2$ nanotubes. We finally study the electronic structures of PtN$_2$\nnanotubes and find that the band gaps of PtN$_2$ nanotubes are tunable by\nchanging the number of unit cells $N$ of single-layer PtN$_2$ used to construct\nthe nanotubes. Our work shows that dimension engineering of PtN$_2$ not only\nleads to a more stable 3D structure but also 1D materials with novel\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 03:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

Previous noise\ntransition based method has achieved promising results and presented a\ntheoretical guarantee on performance in the case of class-conditional noise.\nHowever, this type of approaches critically depend on an accurate\npre-estimation of the noise transition, which is usually impractical.\nSubsequent improvement adapts the pre-estimation along with the training\nprogress via a Softmax layer. However, the parameters in the Softmax layer are\nhighly tweaked for the fragile performance due to the ill-posed stochastic\napproximation. To address these issues, we propose a Latent Class-Conditional\nNoise model (LCCN) that naturally embeds the noise transition under a Bayesian\nframework. By projecting the noise transition into a Dirichlet-distributed\nspace, the learning is constrained on a simplex based on the whole dataset,\ninstead of some ad-hoc parametric space. We then deduce a dynamic label\nregression method for LCCN to iteratively infer the latent labels, to\nstochastically train the classifier and to model the noise.

ECB achieves constant amortized time enumeration\nfor bounded degree graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 03:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

However, the knowledge libraries or deep networks for\nmost recent lifelong learning models are with prescribed size, and can\ndegenerate the performance for both learned tasks and coming ones when facing\nwith a new task environment (cluster). To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel incremental clustered lifelong learning framework with two knowledge\nlibraries: feature learning library and model knowledge library, called\nFlexible Clustered Lifelong Learning (FCL3). Specifically, the feature learning\nlibrary modeled by an autoencoder architecture maintains a set of\nrepresentation common across all the observed tasks, and the model knowledge\nlibrary can be self-selected by identifying and adding new representative\nmodels (clusters). When a new task arrives, our proposed FCL3model firstly\ntransfers knowledge from these libraries to encode the new task,\ni.e.,effectively and selectively soft-assigning this new task to multiple\nrepresentative models over feature learning library. Then, 1) the new task with\na higher outlier probability will be judged as a new representative, and used\nto redefine both feature learning library and representative models over time;\nor 2) the new task with lower outlier probability will only refine the feature\nlearning library. For model optimization, we cast this lifelong learning\nproblem as an alternating direction minimization problem as a new task comes.\nFinally, we evaluate the proposed framework by analyzing several multi-task\ndatasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our FCL3 model can\nachieve better performance than most lifelong learning frameworks, even batch\nclustered multi-task learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 04:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 17:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Here we introduce\nthe MapDE algorithm and its implementation in Maple, for mappings relating\ndifferential equations. We consider the problem of how to algorithmically\ncharacterize, and then to compute mappings of less tractable (Source) systems R\nto more tractable (Target) systems ^R by exploiting the Lie algebra of vector\nfields leaving R invariant. For systems of exact differential polynomials R, ^R\nour algorithm MapDE can decide, under certain assumptions, if there exists a\nlocal invertible mapping Psi(x; u) = (^x; ^u) that maps the Source system R to\nthe Target ^R. We use a result of Bluman and Kumei who have shown that the\nmapping satisfies infinitesimal (linearized) mapping equations that map the\ninfinitesimals of the Lie invariance algebra for R to those for ^R. MapDE\ninvolves applying the differential-elimination algorithm to the defining\nsystems for infinitesimal symmetries of R, ^R, and also to the nonlinear\nmapping equations (including the Bluman-Kumei mapping subsystem); returning\nthem in a form which includes its integrability conditions and for which an\nexistence-uniqueness theorem is available. Once existence is established, a\nsecond stage can determine features of the map, and some times by integration,\nexplicit forms of the mapping. Examples are given to illustrate the algorithm.\nAlgorithm MapDE also allows users to enter broad target classes instead of a\nspecific system ^R. For example, we give an algorithmic approach that avoids\nthe integrations of the Bluman-Kumei approach where MapDE can determine if a\nlinear differential equation R can be mapped to a linear constant coefficient\ndifferential equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 05:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

Because the\nrandomness through the interface affects the flow in the Stokes domain, we\ninvestigate the coupled stochastic Stokes-Darcy model to improve the fidelity\nas this model also considers the second and third porosity of the free flow.\nThen we prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of the\nvariational form. For the numerical solution, we adopt the Monte Carlo (MC)\nmethod and finite element method (FEM), for the discrete form in the\nprobability space and physical space, respectively. In the traditional\nsingle-level Monte Carlo (SLMC) method, more accurate numerical approximate\nrequires both larger number of samples in probability space and smaller mesh\nsize in the physical space. Then the computational cost increase significantly\nas the mesh size becomes smaller for the more accurate numerical approximate.\nTherefore we adopt the multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to dramatically\nreduce the computational cost in the probability space, because the number of\nsamples decays fast while the mesh size decreases. We also develop a strategy\nto calculate the number of samples needed in MLMC method for the stochastic\nStokes-Darcy model. Furthermore MLMC naturally provides the hierarchial grids\nand sufficient information on these grids for multi-grid (MG) method, which can\nin turn improve the efficiency of MLMC. In order to fully make use of the\ndynamical interaction between this two methods, we propose the multi-grid\nmulti-level Monte Carlo method for more efficiently solving the stochastic\nmodel. Numerical examples are provided to verify and illustrate the proposed\nmethod and the theoretical conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 05:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

Our solution differs from the\nstandard deep classification networks on two accounts. First, we use a novel\nloss function, membership loss, in addition to the classical cross-entropy loss\nfor training networks. Secondly, we use the knowledge from the external dataset\nmore effectively to learn globally negative filters, filters that respond to\ngeneric objects outside the known class set. We show that thresholding the\nmaximal activation of the proposed network can be used to identify novel\nobjects effectively. Extensive experiments on four publicly available novelty\ndetection datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 06:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

Such a framework enables the robots to perceive, predict\nand adapt their actions to the human's plan and intelligently avoid collisions\nwith the human based on the predicted human trajectory. Moreover, by explicitly\nleveraging the hierarchical relationship between the plan and trajectories,\nmore robust plan recognition performance can be achieved.

Based on energy barriers directly obtained from\nfirst-principle calculations for single-Li and two-Li intercalated BLG, a new\nequation was deduced for predicting energy barriers considering Li's\ninteractions for multi-Li intercalated BLG. Our calculated results indicate\nthat Li energetically prefers to intercalate within rather than adsorb outside\nthe bilayer graphene. Additionally, lithium exists in cationic state in the\nbilayer graphene. More excitingly, ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient, within\nAB-stacked BLG near room temperature was obtained, which reproduces the\nultrafast Li diffusion coefficient measured in recent experiment. However,\nultrafast Li diffusion was not found within AA-stacked BLG near room\ntemperature. The analyses of potential distribution indicate that the stacking\nstructure of BLG greatly affects its height of potential well within BLG, which\ndirectly leads to the large difference in Li diffusion. Furthermore, it is\nfound that both the interaction among Li ions and the stacking, structure cause\nLi diffusion within AB-stacked BLG to exhibit directional preference. Finally,\nthe temperature dependence of Li diffusion is described by the Arrhenius law.\nThese findings suggest that the stacking structure of BLG has an important\ninfluence on Li diffusion within BLG, and changing the stacking structure of\nBLG is one possible way to greatly improve Li diffusion rate within BLG. At\nlast, it is suggested that AB-stacked BLG can be an excellent candidate for\nanode material in Lithium-ion batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 06:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

By identifying\nthe maximal symmetries, the independent parity conservation sectors, the\nminimum (irreducible) Hilbert space, and especially the relevant anti-unitary\nand unitary operators, we show that the color degree of freedoms lead to novel\nquantum chaotic behaviours. When $N$ is odd, different symmetry operators need\nto be constructed to make the classifications complete. The 2-colored case only\nshow 3-fold Wigner-Dyson way, and the 4-colored case show 10-fold generalized\nWigner-Dyson way which may also have non-trivial edge exponents. We also study\n2- and 4-colored hybrid SYK models which display many salient quantum chaotic\nfeatures hidden in the corresponding pure SYK models. These features motivate\nus to develop a systematic RMT to study the energy level statistics of 2 or 4\nun-correlated random matrix ensembles. The exact diagonalizations are performed\nto study both the bulk energy level statistics and the edge exponents and find\nexcellent agreements with our exact maximal symmetry classifications. Our\ncomplete and systematic methods can be easily extended to study the generic\nimbalanced cases. They may be transferred to the classifications of colored\ntensor models, quantum chromodynamics with pairings across different colors,\nquantum black holes and interacting symmetry protected (or enriched)\ntopological phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 07:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 21:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 18:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

To explore this challenge, we present a\nmultiscale approach combining the synthesis of 4-vinylbenzyl chloride\n(4VBC)-functionalised gelatin (Gel-4VBC) with a voltage-free spinning and\nUV-curing process so that biopolymer networks in the form of either individual\nfibres or nonwovens could be successfully manufactured.

The sequential functionalisation /spinning\nroute proved to be highly scalable, so that one step spunlaid formation of\nfibroblast-friendly nonwoven fabrics was successfully demonstrated with wet\nspun Gel-4VBC fibres.

The\nperturbation expansion is furnished by an interplay of two time scales what has\nan significant impact on the order of convergence. Further, we use these\nasymptotic estimates to prove that there exists a unique solution to the\naforementioned boundary value problem and provide an approximation to the\nsought stiffness. Our results rigorously explain several observations made by\nother researchers concerning the dependence of stiffness on the initial angle\nof the stride and its velocity. The theory is illustrated with a number of\nnumerical calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 08:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

A deep search has allowed us to probe unprecedentedly low burst\nenergies during two consecutive observations (separated by one day) using the\nArecibo telescope at 1.4 GHz. The bursts are generally detected in less than a\nthird of the 580-MHz observing bandwidth, demonstrating that narrow-band FRB\nsignals may be more common than previously thought. We show that the bursts are\nlikely faint versions of previously reported multi-component bursts. There is a\nstriking lack of bursts detected below 1.35 GHz and simultaneous VLA\nobservations at 3 GHz did not detect any of the 41 bursts, but did detect one\nthat was not seen with Arecibo, suggesting preferred radio emission frequencies\nthat vary with epoch. A power law approximation of the cumulative distribution\nof burst energies yields an index $-1.8\\pm0.3$ that is much steeper than the\npreviously reported value of $\\sim-0.7$.

In response, environmental policies have been\nadopted in many countries, to decrease anthropogenic air pollution for the\nimprovement of long-term air quality, since most air pollutant sources are\nanthropogenic. However, air pollution fluctuations have been found to strongly\ndepend on the weather dynamics. This raises a fundamental question: What are\nthe significant atmospheric processes that affect the local daily variability\nof air pollution? For this purpose, we develop here a multi-layered network\nanalysis to detect the interlinks between the geopotential height of the upper\nair (~5 km) and surface air pollution in both China and the USA. We find that\nRossby waves significantly affect air pollution fluctuations through the\ndevelopment of cyclone and anticyclone systems, and further affect the local\nstability of the air and the winds. The significant impacts of Rossby waves on\nair pollution are found to underlie most of the daily fluctuations in air\npollution. Thus, the impact of Rossby waves on human life is greater than\npreviously assumed. The rapid warming of the Arctic could slow down Rossby\nwaves, thus increasing human health risks. Our method can help to determine the\nrisk assessment of such extreme events and can improve potential\npredictability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 09:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

However, the\nsituation becomes more complicated for relatively thin slabs, and a number of\nnew and unexpected phenomena are observed. In particular, when the magnetic\nfield beneath the layer dominates, its effects compete with effects due to\nelasticity, and counteract the elasticity stabilising effects. As a\nconsequence, the layer can become more unstable than when only one of these\nstabilising mechanism is acting.

However, they require large amounts of data to retrain\nto achieve the desired adaptivity, which becomes intractable in practical\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we propose a new decoder: Model Independent Neural Decoder\n(MIND), which builds on the top of neural decoders and equips them with a fast\nadaptation capability to varying channels.

Building on top of existing state-of-the-art\nneural Convolutional and Turbo decoders, MIND outperforms the static benchmarks\nby a large margin and shows minimal performance gap when compared to the neural\n(Convolutional or Turbo) decoders designed for that particular channel.

The Bayesian occupancy grid is the most used method to deal\nwith complex environments. However, this is not fitted to compute the risk\nalong a path by its discrete nature, hence giving poor results. In this\narticle, we present a new way to store the occupancy of the environment that\nallows the computation of risk for a given path. We then define the risk as the\nforce of collision that would occur for a given obstacle.

Deep learning\nmethods offer a new approach for designing decoders that can be trained and\ntailored for arbitrary channel statistics. We focus on Turbo codes and propose\nDeepTurbo, a novel deep learning based architecture for Turbo decoding.\n  The standard Turbo decoder (Turbo) iteratively applies the\nBahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm with an interleaver in the middle. A\nneural architecture for Turbo decoding termed (NeuralBCJR), was proposed\nrecently. There, the key idea is to create a module that imitates the BCJR\nalgorithm using supervised learning, and to use the interleaver architecture\nalong with this module, which is then fine-tuned using end-to-end training.\nHowever, knowledge of the BCJR algorithm is required to design such an\narchitecture, which also constrains the resulting learned decoder. Here we\nremedy this requirement and propose a fully end-to-end trained neural decoder -\nDeep Turbo Decoder (DeepTurbo). With novel learnable decoder structure and\ntraining methodology, DeepTurbo reveals superior performance under both AWGN\nand non-AWGN settings as compared to the other two decoders - Turbo and\nNeuralBCJR.

One important aspect is the\nteaching of technical skills for minimally invasive or robot-assisted\nprocedures. This includes the objective and preferably automatic assessment of\nsurgical skill. Recent studies presented good results for automatic, objective\nskill evaluation by collecting and analyzing motion data such as trajectories\nof surgical instruments. However, obtaining the motion data generally requires\nadditional equipment for instrument tracking or the availability of a robotic\nsurgery system to capture kinematic data. In contrast, we investigate a method\nfor automatic, objective skill assessment that requires video data only. This\nhas the advantage that video can be collected effortlessly during minimally\ninvasive and robot-assisted training scenarios.\n  Methods: Our method builds on recent advances in deep learning-based video\nclassification. Specifically, we propose to use an inflated 3D ConvNet to\nclassify snippets, i.e., stacks of a few consecutive frames, extracted from\nsurgical video. The network is extended into a Temporal Segment Network during\ntraining.\n  Results: We evaluate the method on the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset,\nwhich consists of recordings of basic robot-assisted surgery tasks performed on\na dry lab bench-top model.

We present a study aimed at testing the role of stellar multiplicity\nin the formation and/or evolution of the most massive, close-in planetary and\nsubstellar companions. Using direct imaging observations, as well as the Gaia\nDR2 catalogue, we searched for wide binary companions to 38 stars hosting\nmassive giant planets or brown dwarfs (M > 7 MJup) on orbits shorter than ~1\nAU. We report the discovery of a new component in the WASP-14 system, and\npresent an independent confirmation of a comoving companion to WASP-18.

This binary frequency was found to be\nlarger than for lower-mass planets on similar orbits, and we observed a\nmarginally higher binary rate for inner companions with periods shorter than 10\ndays. These results demonstrate that stellar companions greatly influence the\nformation and/or evolution of these systems, suggesting that the role played by\nbinary companions becomes more important for higher-mass planets, and that this\ntrend may be enhanced for systems with tighter orbits. Our analysis also\nrevealed a peak in binary separation at 250 AU, highlighting a shortfall of\nclose binaries among our sample.

The observed planet-by-planet\nfrequency of strong TTVs is only somewhat lower in systems with 1-2 known\nplanets (7 +/- 1 percent) than in systems with 3+ known planets (11 +/- 2\npercent). We attribute TTVs to known planets in multi-transiting systems, but\nfind about 30 cases where the perturbing planet is unknown. Our conclusions are\nvaluable as an ensemble for learning about planetary system architectures and\nindividually as stepping stones towards more detailed mass-radius constraints.\nWe also discuss Data Release 25 TTVs, about 100 KOIs with Transit Duration\nand/or Depth Variations, and that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) will likely find roughly 10 planets with strong TTVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 12:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

VIC occurs due to the destructive interference between two\nspontaneous decay pathways. An essential condition for VIC is the\nnon-orthogonality of the transition dipole moments associated with the decays.\nFurthermore, the interference between decay pathways requires that the spacing\nbetween the two decaying states must be comparable to or smaller than the\nsquare root of the product of the two spontaneous linewidths.

The direct experimental determination of\nsuch an extremely small error is very challenging by standard quantum-process\ntomography. Instead, the method of randomized benchmarking, which uses a random\nsequence of Clifford gates, has become a standard tool for determination of the\naverage gate error as the decay constant in the exponentially decaying\nfidelity. In this paper, the task for determining a tiny error is addressed by\nsequentially repeating the \\emph{same} gate multiple times, which leads to the\ncoherent amplification of the error, until it reaches large enough values to be\nmeasured reliably. If the transition probability is $p=1-\\epsilon$ with\n$\\epsilon \\ll 1$ in the single process, then classical intuition dictates that\nthe probability after $N$ passes should be $P_N \\approx 1 - N \\epsilon$.\nHowever, this classical expectation is misleading because it neglects\ninterference effects. This paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis based\non the SU(2) symmetry of the qubit propagator, resulting in explicit analytic\nrelations that link the $N$-pass propagator to the single-pass one in terms of\nChebyshev polynomials. In particular, the relations suggest that in some\nspecial cases the $N$-pass transition probability degrades as $P_N =\n1-N^2\\epsilon$, i.e. dramatically faster than the classical probability\nestimate. In the general case, however, the relation between the single-pass\nand $N$-pass propagators is much more involved. Recipes are proposed for\nunambiguous determination of the gate errors in the general case, and for both\nClifford and non-Clifford gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 13:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

In the present work\nwe focus on scalarization due to a non-minimal coupling of the scalar field to\nthe Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant. The coupling acts as a tachyonic mass for\nthe scalar mode, thus leading to the instability of general relativity\nsolutions.

The classical digital filters have a good performance in ideal\nsituations with Gaussian electronic noise and no pulse shape distortion.\nHowever, high-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at CERN, can produce multiple simultaneous radiation events, which\nproduce signal pileup.

Given a snake-like\nrobot with an initial position and a final position in an environment (modeled\nby a graph), our objective is to determine whether the robot can reach the\nfinal position from the initial position without intersecting itself.\nNaturally, this problem models a wide-variety of scenarios, ranging from the\ntransportation of linked wagons towed by a locomotor at an airport or a\nsupermarket to the movement of a group of agents that travel in an `ant-like'\nfashion and the construction of trains in amusement parks. Unfortunately,\nalready on grid graphs, this problem is PSPACE-complete [Biasi and Ophelders,\n2016].

Considering the ejecta structure from multi-group radiation\nhydrodynamics simulation, we find that the observed rapid drop in radio and\nX-ray light curves of SN 1993J at $t>$3000 days can be due to a change in the\nmass-loss rate ($\\dot M$) around $\\sim$6500 years prior to the explosion of the\nSN. The exact epoch scales inversely with the assumed wind velocity of $v_{\\rm\nw}=10~ km~s^{-1}$. The progenitor of this SN very likely belonged to a binary\nsystem, where, during its evolution, the primary had transferred material to\nthe secondary. It is argued in the paper that the change in $\\dot M$ can happen\nbecause of a change in the mass accretion efficiency ($\\eta$) of the companion\nstar. It is possible that before $\\sim6500~(v_{\\rm w}/10~km~s^{-1})^{-1}$years\nprior to the explosion, $\\eta$ was high, thus the CSM was tenuous, which causes\nthe late time downturn in fluxes.

We propose a simple measure for assessing the mixing rate that can\nbe directly applied to experimental data observed in any metric space $X$. For\na compact phase space $X \\subset R^M$, we prove the following statement. If the\nunderlying dynamical system has a unique physical measure and its dynamics is\nstrongly mixing with respect to this measure, then our method provides an upper\nbound of the mixing rate. We employ our method to analyze memory loss for the\nsystem of slowly sheared granular particles with a small inertial number $I$.\nThe shear is induced by the moving walls as well as by the linear motion of the\nsupport surface that ensures approximately linear shear throughout the sample.\nWe show that even if $I$ is kept fixed, the rate of memory loss (considered at\nthe time scale given by the inverse shear rate) depends erratically on the\nshear rate. Our study suggests a presence of bifurcations at which the rate of\nmemory loss increases with the shear rate while it decreases away from these\npoints. We also find that the memory loss is not a smooth process. Its rate is\nclosely related to frequency of the sudden transitions of the force network.\nThe loss of memory, quantified by observing evolution of force networks, is\nfound to be correlated with the loss of correlation of shear stress measured on\nthe system scale.

Compressive sensing is a novel randomized data acquisition\napproach that linearly samples sparse or compressible signals at a rate much\nbelow the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate. The original problem of compressive\nsensing in sparse recovery is NP-hard; therefore, in addition to restrictions\nfor the uniqueness of the sparse solution, the coding matrix has also to\nsatisfy additional stringent constraints -usually the restricted isometry\nproperty (RIP)- so we can handle it by its convex or nonconvex relaxations. In\npractice, such constraints are not only intractable to be verified but also\ninvalid in broad applications. We first divide the well-posed problem of\ncompressive sensing into relaxed sub-problems and represent them as separate\nSAT instances in conjunctive normal form (CNF). After merging the resulting\nsub-problems, we assign weights to all clauses in such a way that the\naggregated weighted-MAX-SAT can guarantee successful recovery of the original\nsignal. The only requirement in our approach is the solution uniqueness of the\nassociated problems, which is notably looser.

Input image resolution and number of near-infrared\npassbands needed by the evolutionary algorithm is also analyzed while the\naccuracy of the best evolved CNN is compared to other CNN variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 13:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

Using high-speed fluorescent thermal imaging in combination with\nelectrical measurements we have investigated the coil under load, including\nvarious ramping tests and over-current experiments. We have found found that\nthe coil does not heat up measurably when being ramped to below its critical\ncurrent. Two over-current experiments are presented, where in one case the coil\nrecovered by itself and in another case a thermal runaway occurred. We have\nrecorded heating in the bulk of the windings due to local defects, however the\ncoil remained cryostable even during some over-critical conditions and heated\nonly to about 82-85 K at certain positions. A thermal runaway was observed at\nthe center, where the highest magnetic field and a resistive joint create a\nnatural defect. The maximum temperature, ~100 K, was reached only in the few\ninnermost windings around the coil former.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 14:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In\nthis paper, both problems are solved together without approximations or\nsimplifications. In fact, the problem solved has a massive amount of\ngrid-connected photovoltaic units, four pump-storage hydro plants as energy\nstorage units and ten thermal power plants, each with its own set of operation\nrequirements that need to be satisfied. To face such a complex constrained\noptimization problem an adaptive repair method is proposed. By including a\ngiven repair method itself as a parameter to be optimized, the proposed\nadaptive repair method avoid any bias in repair choices. Moreover, this results\nin a repair method that adapt to the problem and will improve together with the\nsolution during optimization. Experiments are conducted revealing that the\nproposed method is capable of surpassing exact method solutions on a simplified\nversion of the problem with approximations as well as solve the otherwise\nintractable complete problem without simplifications. Moreover, since the\nproposed approach can be applied to other problems in general and it may not be\nobvious how to choose the constraint handling for a certain constraint, a\nguideline is provided explaining the reasoning behind. Thus, this paper open\nfurther possibilities to deal with the ever changing types of generation units\nand other similarly complex operation/schedule optimization problems with many\ndifficult constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 01:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

When the\nmatrix is Boolean it is favorable to have Boolean factors too. This will save\nthe efforts of quantizing the reconstructed data back, which usually is done\nusing arbitrary thresholds. Here we introduce topFiberM a Boolean matrix\nfactorization algorithm. topFiberM chooses in a greedy way the fibers (rows or\ncolumns) to represent the entire matrix. Fibers are extended to rectangles\naccording to a threshold on precision. The search for these \"top fibers\" can\ncontinue beyond the required rank and according to an optional parameter that\ndefines the limit for this search. A factor with a better gain replaces the\nfactor with minimum gain in \"top fibers\". We compared topFiberM to the\nstate-of-the-art methods, it achieved better quality for the set of datasets\nusually used in literature. We also applied our algorithm to linked-data to\nshow its scalability. topFiberM was in average 128 times faster than the well\nknown Asso method when applied to a set of matrices representing a real\nmultigraph although Asso is implemented in C and topFiberM is implemented in R\nwhich is generally slower than C. topFiberM is publicly available from Github\n(https://github.com/dice-group/BMF).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 02:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

As agents exchange\ntokens a network structure is created in which the tokens move from agent to\nagent. Agents form the vertices in the network and the exchange of tokens\ncreates the link structure. The rules of exchange adopted collectively by\nagents shape the network structure and affect the distribution of tokens\namongst agents. Many inventions including banking, payments networks and\nblockchain technology have been created for the purpose of keeping accurate\nrecords of these implicit networks. However, our formal understanding of\ntokenised systems as large scale, iterative, interacting structures is limited.\nThe aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of token exchanges as a game,\nand introduce a mathematical framework for understanding ledgers as complex\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 19:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) systems are used in industrial, infrastructure and facility\nprocesses (e.g. manufacturing, fabrication, oil and water pipelines, building\nventilation, etc.) Like other Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, SCADA\nsystems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, therefore, a robust anomaly detection\nis a major requirement. However, having an accurate anomaly detection system is\nnot an easy task, due to the difficulty to differentiate between cyber-attacks\nand system internal failures (e.g. hardware failures). In this paper, we\npresent a model that detects anomaly events in a water system controlled by\nSCADA. Six Machine Learning techniques have been used in building and\nevaluating the model. The model classifies different anomaly events including\nhardware failures (e.g. sensor failures), sabotage and cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS\nand Spoofing). Unlike other detection systems, our proposed work focuses on\nnotifying the operator when an anomaly occurs with a probability of the event\noccurring. This additional information helps in accelerating the mitigation\nprocess. The model is trained and tested using a real-world dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 12:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}
