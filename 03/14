The method ensures stability and robustness, where a\nsystem is called robust if it remains stable despite uncertain parameters.\nEssentially, we ensure stability of all steady states of the nonlinear system\non the steady state manifold that results from the variation of the uncertain\nparameters. The uncertain parameters are characterized by finite intervals,\nwhich may be interpreted as error bars and therefore are of immediate practical\nrelevance. Stability despite uncertain parameters can be guaranteed by\nenforcing a lower bound on the distance of the optimal steady state to\nsubmanifolds of saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations on the steady state manifold.\nWe derive constraints that ensure this distance. The proposed method differs\nfrom previous ones in that stability and robustness are guaranteed with\nconstraints instead of with the cost function. Because the cost function is not\nrequired to enforce stability and robustness, it can be used to state economic\nor similar goals, which is natural in applications. We illustrate the proposed\nmethod by optimizing a laser diode. The optimization finds a steady state of\nmaximum intensity while guaranteeing asymptotic or exponential stability\ndespite uncertain model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 16:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

These spectral condensates take the form of large-scale\nvortices in physical space. Recently, evidence for bistability was found in\nthis system close to the critical height: depending on the initial conditions,\nthe flow is either in a condensate state with most of the energy in the\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) large-scale modes, or in a three-dimensional (3-D) flow\nstate with most of the energy in the small-scale modes. This bistable regime is\ncharacterised by the statistical properties of random and rare transitions\nbetween these two locally stable states. Here, we examine these statistical\nproperties in thin-layer turbulent flows, where the energy is injected by\neither stochastic or deterministic forcing. To this end, by using a large\nnumber of direct numerical simulations (DNS), we measure the decay time\n$\\tau_d$ of the 2-D condensate to 3-D flow state and the build-up time $\\tau_b$\nof the 2-D condensate. We show that both of these times $\\tau_d,\\tau_b$ follow\nan exponential distribution with mean values increasing faster than\nexponentially as the layer height approaches the threshold. We further show\nthat the dynamics of large-scale kinetic energy may be modeled by a stochastic\nLangevin equation.

Given a set of $A$ alternatives to choose\nfrom, the overall runtime $O(t^3A)$ is prohibitive. In this paper we introduce\nBKB (budgeted kernelized bandit), a new approximate GP algorithm for\noptimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence\nnear-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and\nremarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP.\n  We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB) with randomized\nmatrix sketching based on leverage score sampling, and we prove that randomly\nsampling inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate\nlow-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence\nintervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from variance starvation, an\nimportant problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations.

However, numerous details of the\nphysics of late-stage stellar mass loss remain poorly understood, ranging from\nthe wind launching mechanism(s) to the geometry and timescales of the mass\nloss. One of the major challenges to understanding AGB winds is that the AGB\nevolutionary phase is characterized by the interplay between highly complex and\ndynamic processes, including radial pulsations, shocks, magnetic fields,\nopacity changes due to dust and molecule formation, and large-scale convective\nflows. Collectively, these phenomena lead to changes in the observed stellar\nproperties on timescales of days to years.

Understanding Earth system\nevolution is central to this pursuit, and a refined understanding of Earth's\nevolution can provide substantive insight into observational and interpretive\nframeworks in exoplanet science.

Recent attempts to\nresolve the mode collapse issue for cGANs are usually task-specific and\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nregularization term to address the mode collapse issue for cGANs. The proposed\nmethod explicitly maximizes the ratio of the distance between generated images\nwith respect to the corresponding latent codes, thus encouraging the generators\nto explore more minor modes during training. This mode seeking regularization\nterm is readily applicable to various conditional generation tasks without\nimposing training overhead or modifying the original network structures. We\nvalidate the proposed algorithm on three conditional image synthesis tasks\nincluding categorical generation, image-to-image translation, and text-to-image\nsynthesis with different baseline models.

In order to fully understand the physical processes at\nwork within galaxies, it is therefore essential to have a firm understanding of\nthe composition, structure, kinematics, thermodynamics, and evolution of the\nCGM.

Even though the Neel and dimer phases are not related hierarchically by\na pattern of symmetry breaking, it was shown that they meet along a line of\nquantum critical points with a U(1) symmetry and central charge $c=1$.

Gravitational fields at the outskirts of early-type galaxies (ETGs)\nare difficult to constrain observationally. It thus remains poorly explored how\nwell the LCDM and MOND hypotheses agree with ETGs.\n  Aims. This led us to gather a large sample of ETGs and examine homogeneously\nwhich dark matter halos they occupy, whether the halos follow the theoretically\npredicted stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and the halo mass-concentration\nrelation (HMCR), whether ETGs obey MOND and the radial acceleration relation\n(RAR) observed for late-type galaxies (LTGs), and finally whether LCDM or MOND\nperform better in ETGs.\n  Methods. We employed Jeans analysis of radial velocities of globular clusters\n(GCs). We analysed nearly all ETGs having more than about 100 archival GC\nradial velocity measurements. The GC systems of our 17 ETGs extend mostly over\nten effective radii. A LCDM simulation of GC formation helped us to interpret\nthe results.\n  Results. Successful LCDM fits are found for all galaxies, but compared to the\ntheoretical HMCR and SHMR, the best-fit halos usually have concentrations that\nare too low and stellar masses that are too high for their masses. This might\nbe because of tidal stripping of the halos or because ETGs and LTGs occupy\ndifferent halos. Most galaxies can be fitted by the MOND models successfully as\nwell, but for some of the galaxies, especially those in centers of galaxy\nclusters, the observed GC velocity dispersions are too high. This might be a\nmanifestation of the additional dark matter that MOND requires in galaxy\nclusters. Additionally, we find many signs that the GC systems were perturbed\nby galaxy interactions. Formal statistical criteria prefer the best-fit LCDM\nmodels over the MOND models, but this might be due to the higher flexibility of\nthe LCDM models. The MOND approach can predict the GC velocity dispersion\nprofiles better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

In this paper, we provide\nthe theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question.\nWe consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized\nReLU activation and Gaussian input data.

We further show the associated coarse gradient\ndescent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss\nminimization problem.

This first population of stars comprised\nmassive stars that exploded as supernovae disseminating the metals they\nsynthesised in the interstellar medium. These massive stars are long dead and\ncannot be observed in the local Universe. Among very metal poor stars\n(metallicity below -2.0) we expect to find the direct descendants of these\npristine metal factories.

The constraints are stronger if the\nchemical inventory is more complete, more chemical elements and isotopic ratios\nare measured for each star. Unfortunately the lower the metallicity of the\nstar, the weaker the lines. Access to the space UV spectral range gives us\ncrucial supplementary information. To start with, it allows access to some very\nstrong Fe lines that may allow to measure the abundance of this element in\nstars for which this was not possible from the ground-accessible UV spectra.\nThe number of such stars is steadily increasing. Next the UV range allows us to\nmeasure elements that cannot be measured from ground-based spectra like P, Ge,\nAs, Se, Cd, Te, Lu, Os, Ir, Pt, Au. In addition it is fundamental for measuring\nother elements that can be accessed from earth, but with great difficulty, like\nC, S, Cu, Zn, Pb. The Hubble space telescope, with its limited collecting power\nmade this possible only for very few stars. Old metal poor stars are cool, of\nspectral types F,G,K, and their UV flux is low. The availability of a UV high\nresolution spectrograph fed by a large area space telescope will open an\nunprecedented window on the early evolution of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

We find that many\nbinaries with P$_{orb} < 20$ d tidally lock, and most with $P_{orb} < 4$ d\ntidally lock into synchronous rotation on circularized orbits.

In this\nwork, we investigate the low-energy properties of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model\non the triangular lattice, including both nearest-neighbor $J_1$ and\nnext-nearest-neighbor $J_2$ super-exchanges, by a dynamical variational Monte\nCarlo approach that allows accurate results on spin models. For $J_2=0$, our\ncalculations are compatible with the existence of a well-defined magnon in the\nwhole Brillouin zone, with gapless excitations at $K$ points (i.e., at the\ncorners of the Brillouin zone). The strong renormalization of the magnon branch\n(also including roton-like minima around the $M$ points, i.e., midpoints of the\nborder zone) is described by our Gutzwiller-projected state, where Abrikosov\nfermions are subject to a non-trivial magnetic $\\pi$-flux threading half of the\ntriangular plaquettes. When increasing the frustrating ratio $J_2/J_1$, we\ndetect a progessive softening of the magnon branch at $M$, which eventually\nbecomes gapless within the spin-liquid phase. This feature is captured by the\nband structure of the unprojected wave function (with $2$ Dirac points for each\nspin component). In addition, we observe an intense signal at low energies\naround the $K$ points, which cannot be understood within the unprojected\npicture and emerges only when the Gutzwiller projection is considered,\nsuggesting the relevance of gauge fields for the low-energy physics of spin\nliquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 19:18:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 13:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

We make use of a canonical formulation of the whole of the\ncosmological system in which the perturbative gauge-invariant degrees of\nfreedom are identified as canonical variables. Introducing background-dependent\nlinear canonical transformations on these perturbations and completing them for\nthe entire system, we are able to characterize a generic collection of\nannihilation and creationlike variables that obey the dynamics dictated by a\nrespective collection of Hamiltonians. We then impose that such Hamiltonians\npossess no self-interaction terms so that, in a Fock representation with normal\nordering, they act diagonally on the basis of $n$-particle states. This leads\nto a semilinear first-order partial differential equation with respect to the\nbackground for the coefficients that define the annihilation and creationlike\nvariables for all Fourier modes, as well as to a very precise ultraviolet\ncharacterization of them. Such first-order equation contains, in the imaginary\npart of its complex solutions, the complicated second-order field equation that\ntypically arises for the time-dependent frequency of the perturbations in the\ncontext of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We check that the\nasymptotic knowledge acquired allows one to select the standard vacua in\nMinkowski and de Sitter spacetimes.

Plasma turbulence is ubiquitous in the\nuniverse, and it is responsible for the transport of mass, momentum, and energy\nin such diverse systems as the solar corona and wind, accretion discs, planet\nformation, and laboratory fusion devices. Turbulence is an inherently\nmulti-scale and multi-process phenomenon, coupling the largest scales of a\nsystem to sub-electron scales via a cascade of energy, while simultaneously\ngenerating reconnecting current layers, shocks, and a myriad of instabilities\nand waves. The solar wind is humankind's best resource for studying the\nnaturally occurring turbulent plasmas that permeate the universe. Since\nlaunching our first major scientific spacecraft mission, Explorer 1, in 1958,\nwe have made significant progress characterizing solar wind turbulence. Yet,\ndue to the severe limitations imposed by single point measurements, we are\nunable to characterize sufficiently the spatial and temporal properties of the\nsolar wind, leaving many fundamental questions about plasma turbulence\nunanswered. Therefore, the time has now come wherein making significant\nadditional progress to determine the dynamical nature of solar wind turbulence\nrequires multi-spacecraft missions spanning a wide range of scales\nsimultaneously. A dedicated multi-spacecraft mission concurrently covering a\nwide range of scales in the solar wind would not only allow us to directly\ndetermine the spatial and temporal structure of plasma turbulence, but it would\nalso mitigate the limitations that current multi-spacecraft missions face, such\nas non-ideal orbits for observing solar wind turbulence.

In computer networks, cardinality\nestimation algorithms are mainly used for counting the number of distinct\nflows, and they are divided into two categories: sketching algorithms and\nsampling algorithms. Sketching algorithms require the processing of all\npackets, and they are therefore usually implemented by dedicated hardware.\nSampling algorithms do not require processing of all packets, but they are\nknown for their inaccuracy. In this work we identify one of the major drawbacks\nof sampling-based cardinality estimation algorithms: their inability to adapt\nto changes in flow size distribution.

But traditional language\nmodels limit the vocabulary to a fixed set of common words. For code, this\nstrong assumption has been shown to have a significant negative effect on\npredictive performance.

Considering the\nHund's coupling-induced electronic correlation, the understanding of the role\nof SOC in FeSCs is not trivial and is still elusive. Here, through a\ncomprehensive study of 77Se and 57Fe nuclear magnetic resonance, a nontrivial\nSOC effect is revealed in the nematic state of FeSe. First, the\norbital-dependent spin susceptibility, determined by the anisotropy of the 57Fe\nKnight shift, indicates a predominant role from the 3dxy orbital, which\nsuggests the coexistence of local and itinerant spin degrees of freedom\n(d.o.f.) in the FeSe. Then, we reconfirm that the orbital reconstruction below\nthe nematic transition temperature (Tnem ~ 90 K) happens not only on the 3dxz\nand 3dyz orbitals but also on the 3dxy orbital, which is beyond a trivial\nferro-orbital order picture. Moreover, our results also indicate the\ndevelopment of a coherent coupling between the local and itinerant spin d.o.f.\nbelow Tnem, which is ascribed to a Hund's coupling-induced electronic crossover\non the 3dxy orbital. Finally, due to a nontrivial SOC effect, sizable in-plane\nanisotropy of the spin susceptibility emerges in the nematic state, suggesting\na spin-orbital-intertwined nematicity rather than simply spin- or\norbital-driven nematicity}.

In this paper, we propose a radically\ndifferent theoretical framework based on extremely anisotropic metamaterials\nfor engineering backscattering-immune waveguides. We theoretically derived the\nexact condition for one-way wave propagation in zigzag paths, and identified a\nnumber of key advantages of the current design over topologically protected\nwaveguides. While the theoretical underpinning is universal and is applicable\nto acoustic and electromagnetic waves, the experimental validation was\nconducted using spoof surface acoustic waves. The proposed metamaterial could\nopen up new possibilities for wave manipulation and lead to applications in\non-chip devices and noise control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 03:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

However, due to the different distribution of synthetic\nimages compared to real images, the desired performance cannot still be\nachieved. Real images consist of multiple forms of light orientation, while\nsynthetic images consist of a uniform light orientation. These features are\nconsidered to be characteristic of outdoor and indoor scenes, respectively. To\nsolve this problem, the previous method learned a model to improve the realism\nof the synthetic image. Different from the previous methods, this paper takes\nthe first step to purify real images. Through the style transfer task, the\ndistribution of outdoor real images is converted into indoor synthetic images,\nthereby reducing the influence of light. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nreal-time style transfer network that preserves image content information (eg,\ngaze direction, pupil center position) of an input image (real image) while\ninferring style information (eg, image color structure, semantic features) of\nstyle image (synthetic image). In addition, the network accelerates the\nconvergence speed of the model and adapts to multi-scale images. Experiments\nwere performed using mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) methods to\ndemonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions.\nQualitatively, it compares the proposed method with the available methods in a\nseries of indoor and outdoor scenarios of the LPW dataset. In quantitative\nterms, it evaluates the purified image by training a gaze estimation model on\nthe cross data set. The results show a significant improvement over the\nbaseline method compared to the raw real image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 05:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

In order to provide fast data\naccess, the NameNode (NN) in HDFS maintains the metadata of all files in its\nmain-memory. Hadoop performs well with a small number of large files that\nrequire relatively little metadata in the NN s memory. But for a large number\nof small files, Hadoop has problems such as NN memory overload caused by the\nhuge metadata size of these small files. We present a new type of archive file,\nHadoop Perfect File (HPF), to solve HDFS s small files problem by merging small\nfiles into a large file on HDFS. Existing archive files offer limited\nfunctionality and have poor performance when accessing a file in the merged\nfile due to the fact that during metadata lookup it is necessary to read and\nprocess the entire index file(s). In contrast, HPF file can directly access the\nmetadata of a particular file from its index file without having to process it\nentirely. The HPF index system uses two hash functions: file s metadata are\ndistributed through index files by using a dynamic hash function and, for each\nindex file, we build an order preserving perfect hash function that preserves\nthe position of each file s metadata in the index file. The HPF design will\nonly read the part of the index file that contains the metadata of the searched\nfile during its access. HPF file also supports the file appending functionality\nafter its creation. Our experiments show that HPF can be more than 40% faster\nfile s access from the original HDFS. If we don t consider the caching effect,\nHPF s file access is around 179% faster than MapFile and 11294% faster than HAR\nfile. If we consider caching effect, HPF is around 35% faster than MapFile and\n105% faster than HAR file.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 03:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

This unexplored\nidea provides the possibility to refine the geometry through controllable order\nelevation strategy for isogeometric analysis. To achieve this, a higher-order\nNURBS layer is used as the contact boundary layer of the bodies. The NURBS\nlayer is constructed using the surface refinement strategies such that it is\naccompanied by a large number of additional degrees of freedom and matches with\nthe bulk parametrization.\n  The validity of the presented isogeometric mortar contact formulation with\nvarying-order NURBS discretization is first examined through the contact patch\ntest.

For this to make sense, an FRP language must ensure that\nall programs are causal, and can be implemented without introducing space leaks\nand time leaks. To this end, some FRP languages do not give direct access to\nsignals, but just to signal functions.\n  Recently, modal types have been suggested as an alternative approach to\nensuring causality in FRP languages in the synchronous case, giving direct\naccess to the signal and event abstractions. This paper presents Simply RaTT, a\nnew modal calculus for reactive programming. Unlike prior calculi, Simply RaTT\nuses a Fitch-style approach to modal types, which simplifies the type system\nand makes programs more concise. Echoing a previous result by Krishnaswami for\na different language, we devise an operational semantics that safely executes\nSimply RaTT programs without space leaks.\n  We also identify a source of time leaks present in other modal FRP languages:\nThe unfolding of fixed points in delayed computations.

Here, we propose\nan optical approach for expanding the detection bandwidth. It uses quantum\nuncertainty squeezing inside one of the optical resonators, compensating for\nfinite resonators' linewidths while maintaining the low-frequency sensitivity\nunchanged. Introducing the quantum expander for boosting the sensitivity of\nfuture gravitational-wave detectors, we envision it to become a new tool in\nother cavity-enhanced metrological experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 12:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

The\nemergence of each torus instability phases is discussed and tori collision has\nbeen also investigated. The first simple evaluation of the center-of-mass\nenergy proves that collision-energy-efficiency increases with the dimensionless\nBH spin. We explore the phenomenological aspects of the corotating and\ncounterrotating tori by analyzing properties of the orbiting toroidal\nconfigurations related to the fluid enthalpy flux, the mass-flux, the\nmass-accretion-rates, and the cusp luminosity in the two cases of corotating\nand counterrotating fluids in dependence on the SMBH spin.

A major issue is that most approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs in\nthe literature suffer under the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense\nthat the computational effort to compute an approximation with a prescribed\naccuracy grows exponentially in the dimension of the PDE or in the reciprocal\nof the prescribed approximation accuracy and nearly all approximation methods\nhave not been shown not to suffer under the curse of dimensionality.

The tontine account is given up to a tontine pool upon death while the\nbequest account value is paid to the retiree's estate. The values of these two\naccounts are continuously re-balanced to the same proportion, which is the key\nfeature of our new product. Our main research question about the new product is\nwhat proportion of pension savings should a retiree allocate to the tontine\naccount. Under a power utility function, we show that more risk averse retirees\nallocate a fairly stable proportion of their pension savings to the tontine\naccount, regardless of the strength of their bequest motive. The proportion\ndeclines as the retiree becomes less risk averse for a while. However, for the\nleast risk averse retirees, a high proportion of their pension savings is\noptimally allocated to the tontine account. This surprising result is explained\nby the least risk averse retirees seeking the potentially high value of the\nbequest account at very old ages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 13:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

We first show that,\nwithout further assumptions, the class of graph languages that can be (stably)\nconstructed under crash faults is non-empty but small. In particular, if an\nunbounded number of crash faults may occur, we prove that (i) the only\nconstructible graph language is that of spanning cliques and (ii) a strong\nimpossibility result holds even if the size of the graphs that the protocol\noutputs in populations of size $n$ need only grow with $n$ (the remaining nodes\nbeing waste). When there is a finite upper bound $f$ on the number of faults,\nwe show that it is impossible to construct any non-hereditary graph language.\nOn the positive side, by relaxing our requirements we prove that: (i)\npermitting linear waste enables to construct on $n/(2f)-f$ nodes, any graph\nlanguage that is constructible in the fault-free case, (ii) partial\nconstructibility (i.e. not having to generate all graphs in the language)\nallows the construction of a large class of graph languages. We then extend the\noriginal model with a minimal form of fault notifications.

We furthermore show that the solutions are determined\nby Cauchy data at the initial time; however, no Cauchy problem is admissible at\nother times. A second result is to extend the first one to particular FLRW\nspacetimes with a Big Bang singularity, using the conformal invariance of the\nDirac equation in the massless case. This shows that the cutoff at $t=0$ can\narise naturally and be fully compatible with relativity. We thus obtain a class\nof interacting, manifestly covariant and rigorous models in 1+3 dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 12:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 11:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

A prominent\nexample is audiovisual signal processing, which has gained increasing attention\nin automatic speech recognition, speaker localization and related tasks. If\nappropriately combined with acoustic information, additional visual cues can\nhelp to improve the performance in these applications, especially under adverse\nacoustic conditions. A dynamic weighting of acoustic and visual streams based\non instantaneous sensor reliability measures is an efficient approach to data\nfusion in this context. This paper presents a framework that extends the\nwell-established theory of nonlinear dynamical systems with the notion of\ndynamic stream weights for an arbitrary number of sensory observations. It\ncomprises a recursive state estimator based on the Gaussian filtering paradigm,\nwhich incorporates dynamic stream weights into a framework closely related to\nthe extended Kalman filter. Additionally, a convex optimization approach to\nestimate oracle dynamic stream weights in fully observed dynamical systems\nutilizing a Dirichlet prior is presented. This serves as a basis for a generic\nparameter learning framework of dynamic stream weight estimators. The proposed\nsystem is application-independent and can be easily adapted to specific tasks\nand requirements.

Coupled with the features of low\nthresholds and backgrounds, they are also excellent telescopes of solar\nneutrinos. In this paper, we study the discovery potential of ton-scale xenon\ndetectors in electromagnetic moments of solar neutrinos. Relevant neutrino-atom\nscattering processes are calculated by applying a state-of-the-arts atomic\nmany-body method--relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA). Limits on\nthese moments are derived from existing data and estimated with future\nexperiment specifications. With one ton-year exposure, XENON-1T can improve the\neffective milli-charge constraint by a factor two. With LZ and DARWIN, the\nprojected improvement on the solar neutrino effective milli-charge(magnetic\nmoment) is around 7(2) times smaller than the current bound. If LZ can keep the\nsame background level and push the electron recoil threshold to 0.5 keV, the\nprojected improvement on milli-charge(magnetic moment) is about 10(3) times\nsmaller than the current bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Enshrining invariants -- desired properties of correct\nexecution -- in code or comments can support maintainability and help sustain\ncorrectness. Tools that can automatically infer and recommend invariants can\nthus be very beneficial. However, current invariant-suggesting tools, such as\nDaikon, suffer from high rates of false positives, in part because they only\nleverage traced program values from available test cases, rather than directly\nexploiting knowledge of the source code per se. We propose a machine-learning\napproach to judging the validity of invariants, specifically of method pre- and\npost-conditions, based directly on a method's source code. We introduce a new,\nscalable approach to creating labeled invariants: using programs with large\ntest-suites, we generate Daikon invariants using traces from subsets of these\ntest-suites, and then label these as valid/invalid by cross-validating them\nwith held-out tests. This process induces a large set of labels that provide a\nform of noisy supervision, which is then used to train a deep neural model,\nbased on gated graph neural networks. Our model learns to map the lexical,\nsyntactic, and semantic structure of a given method's body into a probability\nthat a candidate pre- or post-condition on that method's body is correct and is\nable to accurately label invariants based on the noisy signal, even in\ncross-project settings.

Second-generation stars can form at higher multiplicity, so that BH\naccretion disks may be fed by Roche-lobe overflow from lower-mass companions in\ntheir AGB stage. The near-IR SB constraints can be used to calculate the number\nof caustic transits behind lensing clusters that JWST and the 25~39 m\nground-based telescopes may detect for both Pop III stars and stellar mass BH\naccretion disks. Because Pop III stars and stellar mass BH accretion disks have\nsizes of a few x 10^-11 arcsec at z>7, typical caustic magnifications can be\nmu=10^4~10^5, with rise times of hours and decline times of < 1 year for\ncluster transverse velocities of v<1000 km/s. Microlensing by intracluster\nmedium objects can modify transit magnifications, and lengthen visibility\ntimes. Depending on BH masses, accretion-disk radii and feeding efficiencies,\nstellar-mass BH accretion-disk caustic transits could outnumber those from Pop\nIII stars. To observe Pop III caustic transits directly may require monitoring\n3~30 lensing clusters to AB< 29 mag over a decade or more. Such a program must\nbe started with JWST in Cycle 1, and -- depending on the role of microlensing\nin the Intra Cluster Light -- should be continued for decades with the GMT and\nTMT, where JWST and the ground-based telescopes each will play a unique and\nstrongly complementary role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 22:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

Image set classification aims to classify a set of images,\nwhich were usually obtained from video frames or multi-view cameras, into a\ntarget object. To accurately and stably classify a set, it is essential to\nrepresent structural information of the set accurately. There are various\nrepresentative image features, such as histogram based features, HLAC, and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. We should note that most of them\nhave non-negativity and thus can be effectively represented by a convex cone.\nThis leads us to introduce the convex cone representation to image-set\nclassification. To establish a convex cone based framework, we mathematically\ndefine multiple angles between two convex cones, and then define the geometric\nsimilarity between the cones using the angles. Moreover, to enhance the\nframework, we introduce a discriminant space that maximizes the between-class\nvariance (gaps) and minimizes the within-class variance of the projected convex\ncones onto the discriminant space, similar to the Fisher discriminant analysis.\nFinally, the classification is performed based on the similarity between\nprojected convex cones. The effectiveness of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated experimentally by using five databases: CMU PIE dataset, ETH-80,\nCMU Motion of Body dataset, Youtube Celebrity dataset, and a private database\nof multi-view hand shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

It acts as an enabler for the separation\nof sensors/actors and resources, like memory and computational power. 5G offers\ncharacteristics essential for the proposed approach like robustness, ultra-low\nlatency, high data rates and massive number of devices.\n  A demonstrator of a production line was used as an test environment for 5G in\na real-world industrial application. A wide variety of heterogeneous sensor\nsystems is used by a mobile robot platform. The collected data is transmitted\nvia a 5G network to various Cloud systems. The product is treated as a\ncyber-physical system with a RFID tag in conjunction with the product memory\nsystem.\n  The dynamic production flow approach is discussed centered around the robot\nwhich is used for transportation and inspection of products. This inspection is\nperformed during the transportation and influences the production flow\ndirectly. This is desirable in the scope of Industry 4.0 to have an efficient\nproduction down to batch size 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

We show that, on the CFT side, if the two copies of the\nfield theory are not initially correlated the entropy can only increase such\nthat a definite orientation for the thermodynamic arrow of time is imposed.\nConversely, in a high-correlation environment, the entropy can either increase\nor decrease, such that there is no opportunity for the dominance of one\ndirection of time over the other. On the gravity side, we construct the\nstructure of geometric dual by considering the notion of spacetime sidedness\nand time-orientability. Accordingly, we conjecture that the entanglement of the\nCFTs in the thermofield double state, impose the connection of the two sides of\nthe spacetime forming a one sided spacetime. In addition, disentangling the\ndegrees of freedom of the two CFTs, results in disconnecting the two sides of\nthe spacetime. In essence, the maximal entanglement between the two copies of\nCFT builds, in the geometric dual, a connection between the two sides of\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

The participating nodes in IoT networks are\nusually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber\nattacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the\nsecurity and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional\ncryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes\nrender the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security\nspectrum of the IoT networks. This is, at least in part, because of the\nresource constraints, heterogeneity, massive real-time data generated by the\nIoT devices, and the extensively dynamic behavior of the networks. Therefore,\nMachine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to\nprovide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, are leveraged to\ncope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review\nthe security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions\nfor the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security\nsolutions that call for ML and DL approaches. We also discuss in detail the\nexisting ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT\nnetworks. At last, based on the detailed investigation of the existing\nsolutions in the literature, we discuss the future research directions for ML-\nand DL-based IoT security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 02:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

The three qualities are: suppression, harmony\nand passion. Any formal institution can develop a policy compass to examine the\ndiscrepancy between what the institution would like to do (suggested in its\nmandate) and the actual performance and situation it finds itself in. The\nlatter is determined through an aggregation of statistical data and facts.\nThese are made robust and stable using meta-requirements of convergence. Here,\nI present a version of the compass adapted to embed the central ideas of\necological economics: that society is dependent on the environment, and that\neconomic activity is dependent on society; that we live in a world subject to\nat least the first two laws of thermodynamics; that the planet we live on is\nlimited in space and resources; that some of our practices have harmful and\nirreversible consequences on the natural environment; that there are values\nother than value in exchange, such as intrinsic value and use value. In this\npaper, I explain how to construct a policy compass in general. This is followed\nby the adaptation for ecological economics. The policy compass is original, and\nso is the adaptation. The compass is inspired by the work of Anthony Friend,\nRob Hoffman, Satish Kumar, Georgescu-Roegen, Stanislav Schmelev, Peter\nS\\\"oderbaum and Arild Vatn. In the conclusion, I discuss the accompanying\nconception of sustainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 22:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}
