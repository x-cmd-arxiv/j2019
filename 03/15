Using an algebraic\ninterpretation of Onsager-Straley theory for twisted nematics, we investigate\nthe role of length polydispersity on the pitch of nanorod-based cholesterics\nwith a continuous length polydispersity, and find that polydispersity enhances\nthe twist elastic modulus, $K_{2}$, of the cholesteric material without\naffecting the effective helical amplitude, $K_{t}$. In addition, for the\ninfinitely large average aspect ratios considered here, the dependence of the\npitch on the overall rod concentration is completely unaffected by\npolydispersity. For a given concentration, the increase in twist elastic\nmodulus (and reduction of the helical twist) may be up to 50% for strong size\npolydispersity, irrespective of the shape of the unimodal length distribution.\nWe also demonstrate that the twist reduction is reinforced in bimodal\ndistributions, by doping a polydisperse cholesteric with very long rods.\nFinally, we identify a subtle, non-monotonic change of the pitch across the\nisotropic-cholesteric biphasic region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

We then prove an upper bound and a lower bound for the\nwiretap secret key capacity of a wiretapped PIN and give two conditions for\nwhich these bounds are tight. We also extend our main result to two other\nrelated models and prove their corresponding capacities. At the end, we argue\nhow our analysis suggests that public interaction is required for achieving the\nmultiterminal WSK capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:27:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 19:16:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 22:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

An interpretable, statistical framework is\nintroduced for training these nonlinear networks based on a maximum-likelihood\nobjective function. To learn network parameters, stochastic gradient descent is\napplied to the objective. This direct optimization is stable until convergence,\nand does not involve back-propagation over separate encoder and decoder\nnetworks, or adversarial training of dueling networks. While training remains\ntractable for moderately sized networks, Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\napproximations of gradients are derived for deep networks which contain latent\nvariables.

Dressed operators create particles,\ntogether with their gauge or gravitational fields which typically extend to\ninfinity. This raises an important question of how well quantum information can\nbe localized; one version of this is the question of whether soft charges fully\ncharacterize a given localized charge or matter distribution. This paper finds\nexpressions for the non-trivial soft charges of such dressed operators.\nHowever, a large amount of flexibility in the dressing indicates that the soft\ncharges, and other asymptotic observables, are not inherently correlated with\ndetails of the charge or matter distribution. Instead, these asymptotic\nobservables can be changed by adding a general radiative (source-free) field\nconfiguration to the original one. A dressing can be chosen, perturbatively, so\nthat the asymptotic observables are independent of details of the distribution,\nbesides its total electric or Poincar\\'e charges. This provides an approach to\ndescribing localization of information in gauge theories or gravity, and thus\nsubsystems, that avoids problems associated with nonlocality of operator\nsubalgebras. Specifically, this construction suggests the notions of\nelectromagnetic or gravitational splittings, which involve networks of Hilbert\nspace embeddings in which the charges play an important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 13:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 16:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

These may be the key\nresource for experimental violations of causal inequalities and have been\nrecently identified as resources for concrete information-theoretic tasks.\nHere, we take a step forward by deriving a complete operational framework for\ncausal nonseparability as a resource. Our first contribution is a formal\ndefinition of quantum control of causal orders, a stronger form of causal\nnonseparability (with the celebrated quantum switch as best-known example)\nwhere the causal orders of events for a target system are coherently controlled\nby a control system. We then build a resource theory -- for both generic causal\nnonseparability and quantum control of causal orders -- with a\nphysically-motivated class of free operations, based on process-matrix\nconcatenations. We present the framework explicitly in the mindset with a\ncontrol register. However, our machinery is versatile, being applicable also to\nscenarios with a target register alone. Moreover, an important subclass of our\noperations not only is free with respect to causal nonseparability and quantum\ncontrol of causal orders but also preserves the very causal structure of causal\nprocesses. Hence, our treatment contains, as a built-in feature, the basis of a\nresource theory of quantum causal networks too. As applications, first, we\nestablish a sufficient condition for pure-process free convertibility. This\nimposes a hierarchy of quantum control of causal orders with the quantum switch\nat the top. Second, we prove that causal-nonseparability distillation exists,\ni.e. we show how to convert multiple copies of a process with arbitrarily\nlittle causal nonseparability into fewer copies of a quantum switch.

The absorption\nsystem presented here is the most distant damped Ly-alpha system currently\nknown.

We investigate in what parts of the disk structure\nparameter space dust evolution and line optical depth are the dominant drivers\nof the observed gas and dust size difference. Using the thermochemical model\nDALI with dust evolution included we ran a grid of models aimed at reproducing\nthe observed gas and dust size dichotomy. The relation between R_dust and dust\nevolution is non-monotonic and depends on the disk structure. R_gas is directly\nrelated to the radius where the CO column density drops below 10^15 cm^-2 and\nCO becomes photodissociated. R_gas is not affected by dust evolution but scales\nwith the total CO content of the disk. R_gas/R_dust > 4 is a clear sign for\ndust evolution and radial drift in disks, but these cases are rare in current\nobservations. For disks with a smaller R_gas/R_dust, identifying dust evolution\nfrom R_gas/R_dust requires modelling the disk structure including the total CO\ncontent. To minimize the uncertainties due to observational factors requires\nFWHM_beam < 1x the characteristic radius and a peak SNR > 10 on the 12CO\nemission moment zero map. For the dust outer radius to enclose most of the disk\nmass, it should be defined using a high fraction (90-95%) of the total flux.\nFor the gas, any radius enclosing > 60% of the 12CO flux will contain most of\nthe disk mass. To distinguish radial drift and grain growth from line optical\ndepth effects based on size ratios requires disks to be observed at high enough\nangular resolution and the disk structure should to be modelled to account for\nthe total CO content of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

We employ an Earth climate\nmodel with no land and a slab ocean, and consider two eccentricities ($e=0.3$\nand 0.6) and two rotation rates: a fast Earth-like period of 24 hours, and a\nslower pseudo-synchronous period that generalizes spin synchronization for\neccentric orbits. We adopt bandpasses of the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the\nJames Webb Space Telescope as a template for future photometry. At $e=0.3$ the\nrotation rates can be distinguished if the planet transits near periastron,\nbecause slow rotation produces a strong day-night contrast and thus an emission\nminimum during periastron. However, light curves behave similarly if the planet\nis eclipsed near periastron, as well as for either viewing geometry at $e=0.6$.\nRotation rates can nevertheless be distinguished using ratios of emission in\ndifferent bands, one in the water vapor window with another in a region of\nstrong water absorption. These ratios vary over an orbit by $\\lesssim\\!0.1$ dex\nfor Earth-like rotation, but by 0.3--0.5 dex for pseudo-synchronous rotation\nbecause of large day-night contrast in upper-tropospheric water.

Such large overhead significantly diminishes the performance benefits\noffered by NVM. In this paper, we introduce a new method to reduce the overhead\nof cache-line flushing for logging-based transactions. Different from the\ntraditional method that works at the program level and leverages program\nsemantics to reduce the logging overhead, we introduce architecture awareness.\nIn particular, we do not flush certain cache blocks, as long as they are\nestimated to be eliminated out of the cache because of the hardware caching\nmechanism (e.g., the cache replacement algorithm). Furthermore, we coalesce\nthose cache blocks with low dirtiness to improve the efficiency of cache-line\nflushing. We implement an architecture-aware, high performance transaction\nruntime system for persistent memory, Archapt.

The evolution of clusters of nodes (or communities) is one of the major\nfocus of research. However, the time dimension increases complexity,\nintroducing new constructs and requiring novel and enhanced algorithms. In\nspite of recent improvements, the relative scarcity of timestamped\nrepresentations of empiric networks, with known ground truth, hinders algorithm\nvalidation. A few approaches have been proposed to generate synthetic temporal\nnetworks that conform to static topological specifications while in general\nadopting an ad-hoc approach to temporal evolution. We believe there is still a\nneed for a principled synthetic network generator that conforms to problem\ndomain topological specifications from a static as well as temporal\nperspective. Here we present such a system. The unique attributes of our system\ninclude accepting arbitrary node degree and cluster size distributions and\ntemporal evolution under user control, while supporting tunable joint\ndistribution and temporal correlation of node degrees. Theoretical\ncontributions include the analysis of conditions for \"graphability\" of\nsequences of inter and intra cluster node degrees and cluster sizes and the\ndevelopment of a heuristic to search for the cluster membership of nodes that\nminimizes the shared information distance between clusterings. Our work shows\nthat this system is capable of generating networks under user controlled\ntopology with up to thousands of nodes and hundreds of clusters with strong\ntopology adherence. Much larger networks are possible with relaxed\nrequirements.

Towards this goal, we formulate the problem of\ncomputing the price of anarchy as a tractable linear program.

Modern machine learning works very well on I.I.D. data: data\nfor which each example is drawn {\\em independently} and for which the\ndistribution generating each example is {\\em identical}. When these assumptions\nare relaxed, modern machine learning can perform very poorly. When machine\nlearning is used in contexts where security is a concern, it is desirable to\ndesign models that perform well even when the input is designed by a malicious\nadversary. So far most research in this direction has focused on an adversary\nwho violates the {\\em identical} assumption, and imposes some kind of\nrestricted worst-case distribution shift. I argue that machine learning\nsecurity researchers should also address the problem of relaxing the {\\em\nindependence} assumption and that current strategies designed for robustness to\ndistribution shift will not do so. I recommend {\\em dynamic models} that change\neach time they are run as a potential solution path to this problem, and show\nan example of a simple attack using correlated data that can be mitigated by a\nsimple dynamic defense.

The transition from non-pulsing to pulsing states was not\naccompanied by a large change in flux. Instead, both pulsing and non-pulsing\nstates were observed in a single observation during the low-flux super-orbital\nstate. During the high-state, we measure a pulse period of $P =\n0.70117(9)\\,\\mathrm{s}$ at $T_{ref} = 56145\\,\\mathrm{MJD}$. Spectral analysis\nduring non-pulsing and pulsing states reveals that the observations can be\nconsistently modeled by an absorbed power law with a phenomenological cutoff\nresembling a Fermi-Dirac distribution, or by a partially obscured cutoff power\nlaw. The shapes of the underlying continua show little variability between\nepochs, while the covering fraction and column density vary between\nsuper-orbital states. The strength of pulsations also varies, leading us to\ninfer that the absence and reemergence of pulsations are related to changing\nobscuration, such as by a warped accretion disk. SMC X-1 is accreting near or\nabove its Eddington limit, reaching an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm\nX}({\\rm 2-10~keV}) \\approx 5 \\times 10^{38}\\, {\\rm erg}\\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$. This\nsuggests that SMC X-1 may be a useful local analog to ultraluminous X-ray\npulsars (ULXPs), which likewise exhibit strong variability in their pulsed\nfractions, as well as flux variability on similar timescales. In particular,\nthe gradual pulse turn-on which has been observed in M82 X-2 is similar to the\nbehavior we observe in SMC X-1. Thus we propose that pulse fraction variability\nof ULXPs may also be due to variable obscuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The resources are conceptualized as\nprobabilistic processes from the setting variables to the outcome variables\nhaving a particular causal structure, namely, one wherein the wings are only\nconnected by a common cause. We term them \"common-cause boxes\". We define the\ndistinction between classical and nonclassical resources in terms of whether or\nnot a classical causal model can explain the correlations. One can then\nquantify the relative nonclassicality of resources by considering their\ninterconvertibility relative to the set of operations that can be implemented\nusing a classical common cause (which correspond to local operations and shared\nrandomness). We prove that the set of free operations forms a polytope, which\nin turn allows us to derive an efficient algorithm for deciding whether one\nresource can be converted to another. We moreover define two distinct monotones\nwith simple closed-form expressions in the two-party binary-setting\nbinary-outcome scenario, and use these to reveal various properties of the\npre-order of resources, including a lower bound on the cardinality of any\ncomplete set of monotones. In particular, we show that the information\ncontained in the degrees of violation of facet-defining Bell inequalities is\nnot sufficient for quantifying nonclassicality, even though it is sufficient\nfor witnessing nonclassicality. Finally, we show that the continuous set of\nconvexly extremal quantumly realizable correlations are all at the top of the\npre-order of quantumly realizable correlations.

Here we present a unified approach on both space and time in quantum\ntheory, and build quantum states across spacetime instead of only on spatial\nslices.

As a first step towards\nnon-relativistic quantum field theory, we consider how to approach this in the\ncontinuous-variable multi-mode regime. We propose six possible definitions for\nspacetime states in continuous variables, based on four different measurement\nprocesses: quadratures, displaced parity operators, position measurements and\nweak measurements. The basic idea is to treat different instances of time as\ndifferent quantum modes. They are motivated by the pseudo-density matrix\nformulation among indefinite causal structures and the path integral formalism.\nWe show that these definitions lead to desirable properties, and raise the\ndifferences and similarities between spatial and temporal correlations.

To\novercome this problem, we propose a deep model for the soft multilabel learning\nfor unsupervised RE-ID. The idea is to learn a soft multilabel (real-valued\nlabel likelihood vector) for each unlabeled person by comparing (and\nrepresenting) the unlabeled person with a set of known reference persons from\nan auxiliary domain. We propose the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining\nto learn a discriminative embedding for the unlabeled target domain by\nexploring the similarity consistency of the visual features and the soft\nmultilabels of unlabeled target pairs. Since most target pairs are cross-view\npairs, we develop the cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning to achieve\nthe learning goal that the soft multilabels are consistently good across\ndifferent camera views. To enable effecient soft multilabel learning, we\nintroduce the reference agent learning to represent each reference person by a\nreference agent in a joint embedding.

An effective\nHamiltonian describing the tunable anisotropic quantum Rabi model can be\nderived from a qubit-resonator coupling system modulated by two periodic\ndriving fields.

The derived effective Hamiltonian allows us to\nobtain pure rotating term and counter-rotating term.

The approach builds on the Hughes--Masud stabilized formulation of the\nDarcy problem and the trace finite element method. The system of fractures is\nallowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary way. Moreover, the\nfractures are not triangulated in the common sense and the junctions of\nfractures are not fitted by the mesh. To couple the flow variables at multiple\nfracture junctions, we extend the Hughes--Masud formulation by including\npenalty terms to handle interface conditions. One observation made here is that\nby over-penalizing the pressure continuity interface condition one can avoid\nincluding additional jump terms along the fracture junctions. This simplifies\nthe formulation while ensuring the optimal convergence order of the method. The\napplication of the trace finite element allows to treat both planar and\ncurvilinear fractures with the same ease. The paper presents convergence\nanalysis and assesses the performance of the method in a series of numerical\nexperiments. For the background mesh we use an octree grid with cubic cells.\nThe flow in the fracture can be easily coupled with the flow in matrix, but we\ndo not pursue the topic of discretizing such coupled system here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 04:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 03:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

More specifically, we consider the problem of\ndeciding continuous-time control with temporal logic specifications. We prove\nthat sampled-data control of nonlinear systems with temporal logic\nspecifications is robustly decidable in the sense that, given a continuous-time\nnonlinear control system and a temporal logic formula, one can algorithmically\ndecide whether there exists a robust sampled-data control strategy to realize\nthis specification when the right-hand side of the system is slightly perturbed\nby a small disturbance. If the answer is positive, one can then construct a\n(potentially less) robust sampled-data control strategy that realizes the same\nspecification. The result is proved by constructing a robustly complete\nabstraction of the original continuous-time control system using sufficiently\nsmall discretization parameters.

The proposed method raises an alarm when it discovers a\nfailure by the object detector to detect a traffic sign. This approach can be\nuseful to evaluate the performance of the detector during the deployment phase.\nWe trained a single shot multi-box object detector to detect traffic signs and\nused its internal features to train a separate false negative detector (FND).\nDuring deployment, FND decides whether the traffic sign detector (TSD) has\nmissed a sign or not. We are using precision and recall to measure the accuracy\nof FND in two different datasets. For 80% recall, FND has achieved 89.9%\nprecision in Belgium Traffic Sign Detection dataset and 90.8% precision in\nGerman Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset respectively.

While these models rely heavily on the labeled\nimage pairs, recently some GAN variants have been proposed to tackle the\nunpaired image translation task. These models exploited supervision at the\ndomain level with a reconstruction process for unpaired image translation. On\nthe other hand, parallel works have shown that leveraging perceptual loss\nfunctions based on high level deep features could enhance the generated image\nquality. Nevertheless, as these GAN-based models either depended on the\npretrained deep network structure or relied on the labeled image pairs, they\ncould not be directly applied to the unpaired image translation task. Moreover,\ndespite the improvement of the introduced perceptual losses from deep neural\nnetworks, few researchers have explored the possibility of improving the\ngenerated image quality from classical image quality measures. To tackle the\nabove two challenges, in this paper, we propose a unified quality-aware\nGAN-based framework for unpaired image-to-image translation, where a\nquality-aware loss is explicitly incorporated by comparing each source image\nand the reconstructed image at the domain level. Specifically, we design two\ndetailed implementations of the quality loss. The first method is based on a\nclassical image quality assessment measure by defining a classical\nquality-aware loss. The second method proposes an adaptive deep network based\nloss. Finally, extensive experimental results on many real-world datasets\nclearly show the quality improvement of our proposed framework, and the\nsuperiority of leveraging classical image quality measures for unpaired image\ntranslation compared to the deep network based model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

For relatively small $k$ w.r.t. the input size $n$, learning\n$k$-junta functions is one of fundamental problems both theoretically and\npractically in machine learning. For the last two decades, much effort has been\nmade to design efficient learning algorithms for Boolean junta functions, and\nsome novel techniques have been developed. However, in real world,\nmulti-labeled data seem to be obtained in much more often than binary-labeled\none. Thus, it is a natural question whether these techniques can be applied to\nmore general cases about the alphabet size.\n  In this paper, we expand the Fourier detection techniques for the binary\nalphabet to any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and give, roughly speaking, an\n$O(n^{0.8k})$-time learning algorithm for $k$-juntas over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.

Hence, it has led the human society to move towards the\nuse of renewable energies, including solar energy. In recent years, one of the\nmost popular methods to gain energy is using photovoltaic arrays to produce\nsolar energy. Skyscrapers and different weather conditions cause shadings on\nthese PV arrays, which leads to less power generation. Various methods such as\nTCT and Sudoku patterns have been proposed to improve power generation for\npartial shading PV arrays, but these methods have some problems such as not\ngenerating maximum power and being designed for a specific dimension of PV\narrays. Therefore, we proposed a metaheuristic algorithm-based approach to\nextract maximum possible power in the shortest possible time. In this paper,\nfive algorithms which have proper results in most of the searching problems are\nchosen from different groups of metaheuristic algorithms. Also, four different\nstandard shading patterns are used for more realistic analysis. Results show\nthat the proposed method achieves better results in maximum power generation\ncompared to TCT arrangement (18.53%) and Sudoku arrangement (4.93%). Also, the\nresults show that GWO is the fastest metaheuristic algorithm to reach maximum\noutput power in PV arrays under partial shading condition. Thus, the authors\nbelieve that by using metaheuristic algorithms, an efficient, reliable, and\nfast solution is reached to solve partial shading PV arrays problem\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 08:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

For a robotic teammate, the ability to generate explanations to\njustify its behavior is one of the key requirements of explainable agency.\nPrior work on explanation generation has been focused on supporting the\nrationale behind the robot's decision or behavior. These approaches, however,\nfail to consider the mental demand for understanding the received explanation.\nIn other words, the human teammate is expected to understand an explanation no\nmatter how much information is presented. In this work, we argue that\nexplanations, especially those of a complex nature, should be made in an online\nfashion during the execution, which helps spread out the information to be\nexplained and thus reduce the mental workload of humans in highly cognitive\ndemanding tasks. However, a challenge here is that the different parts of an\nexplanation may be dependent on each other, which must be taken into account\nwhen generating online explanations. To this end, a general formulation of\nonline explanation generation is presented with three variations satisfying\ndifferent \"online\" properties.

The reason is straightforward as the PWN is too\nweak to generate enough high energy electrons and positrons to stimulate strong\nturbulence at the late time. We then propose an assumption that the strong\nturbulence is generated by the shock wave of the parent supernova remnant (SNR)\nof Geminga.

We aim to understand the dimming properties, examine accretion\nvariability, and derive the physical properties of the inner disc traced by the\nCO ro-vibrational emission at NIR wavelengths (2.3 mic).\n  We compared two epochs of X-Shooter observations, during and after the\ndimming. We modelled the rarely detected CO bandhead emission in both epochs to\nexamine whether the inner disc properties had changed. The SED was used to\nderive the extinction properties of the dimmed spectrum and compare the\ninfrared excess between the two epochs. Lines tracing accretion were used to\nderive the mass accretion rate in both states. The CO originates from a region\nwith physical properties of T=3000 K, N$_{CO}$=1x10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and\nvsini=113 km/s. The extinction properties of the dimming layer were derived\nwith the effective optical depth ranging from teff 2.5-1.5 from the UV to the\nNIR. The inferred mass accretion rate Macc is $1.5x 10^{-8}$ Msun/yr and $\\sim\n2x 10^{-8}$ Msun/yr after and during the dimming respectively. By fitting the\nSED, additional emission is observed in the IR during the dimming event from\ndust grains with temperatures of 500-700K. The physical conditions traced by\nthe CO are similar for both epochs, indicating that the inner gaseous disc\nproperties do not change during the dimming events. The extinction curve is\nflatter than that of the ISM, and large grains of a few hundred microns are\nthus required. When we correct for the observed extinction, Macc is constant in\nthe two epochs, suggesting that the accretion is stable and therefore does not\ncause the dimming. The additional hot emission in the NIR is located at about\n0.5 au from the star. The dimming events could be due to a dust-laden wind, a\nsevere puffing-up of the inner rim, or a perturbation caused by the recent\nstar-disc encounter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 09:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

In this paper, we design three transmission schemes aiming to\nminimize the delivery latency for cache-enabled multigroup multicasting\nnetworks. In particular, full caching bulk transmission scheme is first\ndesigned as a performance benchmark for the ideal situation where the caching\ncapability of each enhanced remote radio head (eRRH) is sufficient large to\ncache all files. For the practical situation where the caching capability of\neach eRRH is limited, we further design two transmission schemes, namely\npartial caching bulk transmission (PCBT) and partial caching pipelined\ntransmission (PCPT) schemes. In the PCBT scheme, eRRHs first fetch the uncached\nrequested files from the baseband unit (BBU) and then all requested files are\nsimultaneously transmitted to the users. In the PCPT scheme, eRRHs first\ntransmit the cached requested files while fetching the uncached requested files\nfrom the BBU. Then, the remaining cached requested files and fetched uncached\nrequested files are simultaneously transmitted to the users. The design goal of\nthe three transmission schemes is to minimize the delivery latency, subject to\nsome practical constraints. Efficient algorithms are developed for the\nlow-latency cloud-edge coordinated transmission strategies. Numerical results\nare provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed transmission schemes\nand show that the PCPT scheme outperforms the PCBT scheme in terms of the\ndelivery latency criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 10:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

For the RBCs, we propose a nodal projective FEM\n(npFEM) solver which has theoretical advantages over the more commonly used\nmass-spring systems (mesoscopic modeling), such as an unconditional stability,\nversatile material expressivity, and one set of parameters to fully describe\nthe behavior of the body at any mesh resolution.

At its core,\nthe solver uses specially defined potential energies, and builds upon them a\nfast iterative procedure based on quasi-Newton techniques. For a known\nmaterial, our solver has only one free parameter that demands tuning, related\nto the body viscoelasticity. In contrast, state-of-the-art solvers for\ndeformable bodies have more free parameters, and the calibration of the models\ndemands special assumptions regarding the mesh topology, which restrict their\ngenerality and mesh independence.

We find $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios\nthat span from $\\sim$100 up to $\\sim$220 and these values are lower or equal\nthan those observed with single-dish observations towards the same source.\nSince N-fractionation changes across the studied region, this means that it is\nregulated by local environmental effects. We find also the possibility, for one\nof the four cores defined in the protocluster, to have a more abundant\n$^{15}$NNH$^{+}$ with respect to N$^{15}$NNH$^{+}$. This is another indication\nthat current chemical models may be missing chemical reactions or may not take\ninto account other mechanisms, like photodissociation or grain surface\nchemistry, that could be important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 14:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Detector effects like efficiency and smearing\nare undone mathematically, yielding distributions in true event properties.\nThis is an ill-posed problem, as even small statistical variations in the\nreconstructed data can lead to large changes in the unfolded spectra.\n  This work presents an alternative or complementary approach: the\nresponse-matrix-centred forward-folding approach. It offers a convenient way to\nforward-fold model expectations in truth space to reconstructed quantities.\nThese can then be compared to the data directly, similar to what is usually\ndone with full detector simulations within the experimental collaborations. For\nthis, the detector response (efficiency and smearing) is parametrised as a\nmatrix. The effects of the detector on the measurement of a given model is\nsimulated by simply multiplying the binned truth expectation values by this\nresponse matrix.\n  Systematic uncertainties in the detector response are handled by providing a\nset of matrices according to the prior distribution of the detector properties\nand marginalising over them. Background events can be included in the\nlikelihood calculation by giving background events their own bins in truth\nspace.\n  To facilitate a straight-forward use of response matrices, a new software\nframework has been developed: the Response Matrix Utilities (ReMU). ReMU is a\nPython package distributed via the Python Package Index. It only uses widely\navailable, standard scientific Python libraries and does not depend on any\ncustom experiment-specific software.

A building block called\nSelective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with\ndifferent kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the\ninformation in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield\ndifferent sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion\nlayer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel\nNetworks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show\nthat SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower\nmodel complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture\ntarget objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons\nfor adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.\nThe code and models are available at https://github.com/implus/SKNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 15:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 03:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

In this approach, a\nhigh-resolution quadrupole-ToF mass spectrometer acquires thousands of MS/MS\ndata by selecting not just a single precursor at a time, but by allowing a\nbroad m/z range to be fragmented. This acquisition window is then sequentially\nmoved from the lowest to the highest mass selection range. This technique\nenables the acquisition of thousands of high-resolution MS/MS spectra per\nminute in a standard LC-MS run. In the subsequent data analysis phase, the\ncorresponding dataset is searched in a triple quadrupole-like mode, thus not\nconsidering the whole MS/MS scan spectrum, but by searching for several\nprecursor to fragment transitions that identify and quantify the corresponding\npeptide.

The geometry of the CME/shock event was recovered through 3D modeling,\ngiven the absence of concomitant stereoscopic observations, and assuming that\nthe band-splitted type II burst was emitted at the intersection of the shock\nsurface with two adjacent low-Alfven speed coronal streamers. From the derived\nspatiotemporal evolution of the standoff distance between shock and CME leading\nedge, we were finally able to infer the magnetic field strength $B$ in the\ninner corona.

On the basis of which we conjecture that\nparallel communicating one-way reversible finite automata systems may accept\nlanguages not accepted by multi-head one way reversible finite automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 09:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

Just\nas QHE in two-dimensional electron gases can be understood in terms of Chern\nnumber topological invariants that belong to the first Chern class, QHE in 4D\nand 8D can be understood in terms of Chern number topological invariants that\nbelong to the 2nd and 4th Chern classes. It has been shown that 2D QHE\nphenomena are related to topologically-ordered ground states of Josephson\njunction arrays (JJAs), which map onto an Abelian gauge theory with a periodic\ntopological term that describes charge-vortex coupling. In these 2D JJAs,\nmagnetic point defects and Cooper pair electric charges are dual to one another\nvia electric-magnetic duality (Montonen-Olive). This leads to a quantum phase\ntransition between phase-coherent superconductor and dual phase-incoherent\nsuperinsulator ground states, at a \"self-dual\" critical point. In this article,\na framework for topological-ordering of Bose-Einstein condensates is extended\nto consider four-dimensional quaternion ordered systems that are related to 4D\nQHE. This is accomplished with the incorporation of a non-Abelian topological\nterm that describes coupling between third homotopy group point defects (as\ngeneralized magnetic vortices) and Cooper pair-like charges. Point defects\nbelonging to the third homotopy group are dual to charge excitations, and this\nleads to the manifestation of a quantum phase transition between\norientationally-ordered and orientationally-disordered ground states at a\n\"self-dual\" critical point. The frustrated ground state in the vicinity of this\n\"self-dual\" critical point, are characterized by global topological invariants\nbelonging to the 2nd Chern class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

Our primary goal is to validate the models by interpreting\nthe importance of predictors in the final models. Central to interpretation is\nthe use of feature importance scores, which vary depending on the underlying\nmethodology. In order to assess feature importance, we compared univariate\nstatistical tests, information-theoretic measures, permutation testing, and\nnormalized coefficients from multivariate logistic regression models. In\ngeneral we found poor correlation between methods in their assessment of\nfeature importance, even when their performance is comparable and relatively\ngood.

This research presents a\nnovel conceptual framework to mitigate the risk of insiders using deterrence\nand prevention approaches. Deterrence factors discourage employees from\nengaging in information security misbehaviour in organisations, and situational\ncrime prevention factors encourage them to prevent information security\nmisconduct.

Finally, the output of the data analysis also showed that\nsubjective norms, perceived behavioural control and attitude influence\nindividuals' intentions, and, ultimately, their behaviour towards avoiding\ninformation security misbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 13:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

The\nmotivation is to build shallow networks which are more interpretable in the\nmedical imaging domain. Radon transform is an established technique that can\nreconstruct images from parallel projections. The Projectron first applies\nglobal Radon transform to each image using equidistant angles and then feeds\nthese transformations for encoding to a single layer of neurons followed by a\nlayer of suitable kernels to facilitate a linear separation of projections.\nFinally, the Projectron provides the output of the encoding as an input to two\nmore layers for final classification. We validate the Projectron on five\npublicly available datasets, a general dataset (namely MNIST) and four medical\ndatasets (namely Emphysema, IDC, IRMA, and Pneumonia). The results are\nencouraging as we compared the Projectron's performance against MLPs with raw\nimages and Radon projections as inputs, respectively. Experiments clearly\ndemonstrate the potential of the proposed Projectron for\nrepresenting/classifying medical images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 12:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

The gold\nstandard for arousal detection in human polysomnographic recordings (PSGs) is\nmanual annotation by expert human scorers, a method with significant\ninterscorer variability. In this study, we developed an automated method, the\nMultimodal Arousal Detector (MAD), to detect arousals using deep learning\nmethods. The MAD was trained on 2,889 PSGs to detect both cortical arousals and\nwakefulness in 1 second intervals. Furthermore, the relationship between\nMAD-predicted labels on PSGs and next day mean sleep latency (MSL) on a\nmultiple sleep latency test (MSLT), a reflection of daytime sleepiness, was\nanalyzed in 1447 MSLT instances in 873 subjects. In a dataset of 1,026 PSGs,\nthe MAD achieved a F1 score of 0.76 for arousal detection, while wakefulness\nwas predicted with an accuracy of 0.95. In 60 PSGs scored by multiple human\nexpert technicians, the MAD significantly outperformed the average human scorer\nfor arousal detection with a difference in F1 score of 0.09. After controlling\nfor other known covariates, a doubling of the arousal index was associated with\nan average decrease in MSL of 40 seconds ($\\beta$ = -0.67, p = 0.0075). The MAD\noutperformed the average human expert and the MAD-predicted arousals were shown\nto be significant predictors of MSL, which demonstrate clinical validity the\nMAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 10:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}
