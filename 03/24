However, there\nexists obvious conflicting requirements in multi-orientation object detection\nthat classification is insensitive to orientations, while regression is quite\nsensitive. To address this issue, we provide an Encoder-Decoder architecture,\ncalled Rotated Feature Network (RFN), which produces rotation-sensitive feature\nmaps (RS) for regression and rotation-invariant feature maps (RI) for\nclassification. Specifically, the Encoder unit assigns weights for rotated\nfeature maps. The Decoder unit extracts RS and RI by performing resuming\noperator on rotated and reweighed feature maps, respectively. To make the\nrotation-invariant characteristics more reliable, we adopt a metric to\nquantitatively evaluate the rotation-invariance by adding a constrain item in\nthe loss, yielding a promising detection performance.

Since measuring\nlinguistic competence using current approaches is difficult, expensive and in\nmany cases imprecise, we present a new alternative approach based on social\nnetworks. Our method, called Proficiency Rank, extends the well-known Page Rank\nalgorithm to measure the reputation of users in a collaborative social graph.\nFirst, we extended Page Rank so that it not only considers positive links\n(votes) but also negative links. Second, in addition to using explicit links,\nwe also incorporate other 4 types of signals implicit in the social graph.\nThese extensions allow Proficiency Rank to produce proficiency rankings for\nalmost all users in the data set used, where only a minority contributes by\nanswering, while the majority contributes only by voting. This overcomes the\nintrinsic limitation of Page Rank of only being able to rank the nodes that\nhave incoming links. Our experimental validation showed that the\nreputation/importance of the users in Yask is significantly correlated with\ntheir language proficiency. In contrast, their written production was poorly\ncorrelated with the vocabulary profiles of the Common European Framework of\nReference.

Successful modern\nday methods for 3D scene understanding require the use of a 3D sensor. On the\nother hand, single image based methods have significantly worse performance. In\nthis work, we aim at bridging the performance gap between 3D sensing and 2D\nsensing for 3D object detection by enhancing LiDAR-based algorithms to work\nwith single image input. Specifically, we perform monocular depth estimation\nand lift the input image to a point cloud representation, which we call\npseudo-LiDAR point cloud. Then we can train a LiDAR-based 3D detection network\nwith our pseudo-LiDAR end-to-end. Following the pipeline of two-stage 3D\ndetection algorithms, we detect 2D object proposals in the input image and\nextract a point cloud frustum from the pseudo-LiDAR for each proposal. Then an\noriented 3D bounding box is detected for each frustum. To handle the large\namount of noise in the pseudo-LiDAR, we propose two innovations: (1) use a\n2D-3D bounding box consistency constraint, adjusting the predicted 3D bounding\nbox to have a high overlap with its corresponding 2D proposal after projecting\nonto the image; (2) use the instance mask instead of the bounding box as the\nrepresentation of 2D proposals, in order to reduce the number of points not\nbelonging to the object in the point cloud frustum. Through our evaluation on\nthe KITTI benchmark, we achieve the top-ranked performance on both bird's eye\nview and 3D object detection among all monocular methods, effectively\nquadrupling the performance over previous state-of-the-art.

However, for cylindrical wormhole\nsolutions a problem is the lacking asymptotic flatness, making it impossible to\nobserve their entrances as local objects in our Universe. It was suggested to\nsolve this problem by joining a wormhole solution to flat asymptotic regions at\nsome surfaces $\\Sigma_-$ and $\\Sigma_+$ on different sides of the throat. The\nconfiguration then consists of three regions, the internal one containing a\nthroat and two flat external ones.

The variability\nof the braking torque can be significant. For example, the largest torque for\n$\\epsilon$ Eri is twice its decadal averaged value. This variation is\ncomparable to that observed in the solar wind, when sparsely sampled. On\naverage, the torques in our sample range from 0.5-1.5 times their average\nvalue.

Depending on these ENF\nvariations, the luminous intensity of a mains-powered light source also\nfluctuates. These fluctuations in luminance can be captured by video\nrecordings. Accordingly, ENF can be estimated from such videos by analysis of\nsteady content in the video scene. When videos are captured by using a rolling\nshutter sampling mechanism, as is done mostly with CMOS cameras, there is an\nidle period between successive frames. Consequently, a number of illumination\nsamples of the scene are effectively lost due to the idle period.

Deep reinforcement learning is a promising\ntechnique to tackle the task of mapless navigation. Since reinforcement\nlearning requires a lot of explorations, it is usually necessary to train the\nagent in the simulator and then migrate to the real environment. The big\nreality gap makes RGB image, the most common visual sensor, rarely used. In\nthis paper we present a learning-based mapless motion planner by taking RGB\nimages as visual inputs. Many parameters in end-to-end navigation network\ntaking RGB images as visual input are used to extract visual features.\nTherefore, we decouple visual features extracted module from the reinforcement\nlearning network to reduce the need of interactions between agent and\nenvironment.

In low-disorder, two-dimensional\n(2D) electron systems, the quantum WC is known to be favored at very low\ntemperatures ($T$) and small Landau level filling factors ($\\nu$), near the\ntermination of the fractional quantum Hall states. This WC phase exhibits an\ninsulating behavior, reflecting its pinning by the small but finite disorder\npotential. An experimental determination of a $T$ vs $\\nu$ phase diagram for\nthe melting of the WC, however, has proved to be challenging. Here we use\ncapacitance measurements to probe the 2D WC through its effective screening as\na function of $T$ and $\\nu$. We find that, as expected, the screening\nefficiency of the pinned WC is very poor at very low $T$ and improves at higher\n$T$ once the WC melts. Surprisingly, however, rather than monotonically\nchanging with increasing $T$, the screening efficiency shows a well-defined\nmaximum at a $T$ which is close to the previously-reported melting temperature\nof the WC. Our experimental results suggest a new method to map out a $T$ vs\n$\\nu$ phase diagram of the magnetic-field-induced WC precisely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 09:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

While its\nanticyclonic vortex appearance suggests it might be a shallow weather-layer\nfeature, the very long time span for which it was observed implies it is likely\ndeeply rooted, otherwise it would have been sheared apart by Jupiter's\nturbulent atmosphere. Determining the GRS depth will shed light not only on the\nprocesses governing the GRS, but on the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere as a\nwhole. The Juno mission single flyby over the GRS (PJ7) discovered using\nmicrowave radiometer measurements that the GRS is at least a couple hundred\nkilometers deep (Li et al. 2017).

Due to difficulties in obtaining\ndynamically measured BH masses in distant galaxies, we use the Fundamental\nPlane relationship of BHs to infer their masses. We utilize X-ray observations\ntaken by $Chandra$ to measure the temperature of the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM), which is a proxy for the total mass of the cluster. We analyze the $\\rm\nM_{BH}-kT$ and $\\rm M_{BH}-M_{Bulge}$ relationships and establish the\nbest-fitting power laws:$\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm BH} /10^9 M_{\\odot})=-0.35+2.08\n\\log_{10}(kT / 1 \\rm keV)$ and $\\log_{10}(\\rm M_{BH}/10^9M_{\\odot})= -1.09+\n1.92 \\log_{10}(M_{\\rm bulge}/10^{11}M_{\\odot})$. Both relations are comparable\nwith that established earlier for a sample of brightest group/cluster galaxies\nwith dynamically measured BH masses. Although both the $\\rm M_{BH}-kT$ and the\n$\\rm M_{BH}-M_{Bulge}$ relationships exhibit large intrinsic scatter, based on\nMonte Carlo simulations we conclude that dominant fraction of the scatter\noriginates from the Fundamental Plane relationship. We split the sample into\ncool core and non-cool core resembling clusters, but do not find statistically\nsignificant differences in the $\\rm M_{BH}-kT$ relation. We speculate that the\noverly massive BHs in BCGs may be due to frequent mergers and cool gas inflows\nonto the cluster center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 10:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In the\nopposite, small $J$ or $V$, limit, the moments survive, and the conduction\nelectrons mediate an effective interaction which can trigger long range, often\nantiferromagnetic, order. In the case of the Kondo model, where the moments are\ndescribed by local spins, Nozi\\`eres considered the possibility that the\navailable conduction electrons within the Kondo temperature of the Fermi\nsurface would be insufficient in number to accomplish the screening.

Formally,\nthe MHD equations, with flows and gravity as part of a wide class of physical\nprocesses, separate into independent local and global relations representing an\nequilibrium solution for embedded current-carrying fields.

Recently, a promising direction for SSR is to\nlearn a complicated mapping function from the RGB image to the HSI counterpart\nusing a deep convolutional neural network. This essentially involves mapping\nthe RGB context within a size-specific receptive field centered at each pixel\nto its spectrum in the HSI. The focus thereon is to appropriately determine the\nreceptive field size and establish the mapping function from RGB context to the\ncorresponding spectrum. Due to their differences in category or spatial\nposition, pixels in HSIs often require different-sized receptive fields and\ndistinct mapping functions. However, few efforts have been invested to\nexplicitly exploit this prior.\n  To address this problem, we propose a pixel-aware deep function-mixture\nnetwork for SSR, which is composed of a new class of modules, termed\nfunction-mixture (FM) blocks. Each FM block is equipped with some basis\nfunctions, i.e., parallel subnets of different-sized receptive fields. Besides,\nit incorporates an extra subnet as a mixing function to generate pixel-wise\nweights, and then linearly mixes the outputs of all basis functions with those\ngenerated weights. This enables us to pixel-wisely determine the receptive\nfield size and the mapping function. Moreover, we stack several such FM blocks\nto further increase the flexibility of the network in learning the pixel-wise\nmapping. To encourage feature reuse, intermediate features generated by the FM\nblocks are fused in late stage, which proves to be effective for boosting the\nSSR performance. Experimental results on three benchmark HSI datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 13:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Power-law distributions, for\nexample, project diverse natural phenomenon, ranging from earthquakes1 to\nheartbeat dynamics2 onto a common platform of statistical self-similarity. A\nlarge range of human languages are known to follow a specific regime of\npower-law distributions, the Zipf-Mandelbrot law, in addition to showing\nproperties like the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy3,4. Animal behaviour\nin specific contexts have been shown to follow power-law distributions5,6.\nHowever, the entire behavioural repertoire of a species has never been analysed\nfor the existence of underlying patterns. Here we show that the frequency-rank\ndata of randomly sighted behaviours at the population level of free-ranging\ndogs follow a scale-invariant power-law behaviour. While the data does not\ndisplay Zipfian trends, it obeys the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy rules\nakin to languages. Interestingly, the data also exhibits robust self-similarity\npatterns at different scales which we extract using multifractal detrended\nfluctuation analysis7. The observed multifractal trends suggest that the\nprobability of consecutive occurrence of behaviours of adjacent ranks is much\nhigher than behaviours widely separated in rank. Since we observe such robust\ntrends in random data sets, we hypothesize that the general behavioural\nrepertoire of a species is shaped by a syntax similar to languages. This opens\nup the prospect of future multifractal and other statistical investigations on\ntrue time series of behavioural data to probe the existence of possible long\nand short-range correlations, and thereby develop predictive models of\nbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 17:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 19:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}
