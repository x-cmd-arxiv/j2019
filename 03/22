In this case, an ASP has to cautiously\ndecide where to deploy the edge service and how much budget it is willing to\nuse. A central issue here is that the service demand received by each edge\nsite, which is the key factor of deploying benefit, is unknown to ASPs a\npriori. What's more complicated is that this demand pattern varies temporally\nand spatially across geographically distributed edge sites. In this paper, we\ninvestigate an edge resource rental problem where the ASP learns service demand\npatterns for individual edge sites while renting computation resource at these\nsites to host its applications for edge service provisioning. An online\nalgorithm, called Context-aware Online Edge Resource Rental (COERR), is\nproposed based on the framework of Contextual Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandit\n(CC-MAB). COERR observes side-information (context) to learn the demand\npatterns of edge sites and decides rental decisions (including where to rent\nthe computation resource and how much to rent) to maximize ASP's utility given\na limited budget. COERR provides a provable performance achieving sublinear\nregret compared to an Oracle algorithm that knows exactly the expected service\ndemand of edge sites.

More generally, high and\nlow-quality tips can be distinguished with a mean precision of 0.96 and near\nperfect area-under-curve of 0.98. With trivial modifications, we also\nsuccessfully automatically identify undesirable, non-surface-specific states on\nsurfaces of Au(111) and Cu(111). In these cases we find mean precisions of 0.95\nand 0.75 and area-under-curves of 0.98 and 0.94, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 16:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

The second part of our\nstudy is using the estimated mid-price dynamics to investigate the amplitude of\nits price impact and the decay pattern of individual bond transaction.

Despite conflicting experimental literature\nregarding its low temperature structure, there exists no theoretical study of\nthe phonon properties and lattice stability of this material. By studying the\nfirst-principles electronic structure and phonon properties of CuS$_2$ at\nvarious electronic temperatures, we identify temperature-sensitive soft phonon\nmodes which unveil a previously unreported Kohn anomaly at approximately 100K.\nVariation of the electronic temperature shows the presence of two distinct\nphases, characterized at low temperature by a $2\\times2\\times2$ periodic charge\nmodulation associated with the motion of the S$_2$ dimers. Investigation of the\nFermi surface presents a potential Fermi surface nesting vector related to the\nlocation of the Kohn anomaly and observed band splittings in the unfolded\nbandstructure. The combination of these results suggests a strong possibility\nof CDW order in CuS$_2$. Further study of CuS$_2$ in monolayer form finds no\nevidence of a CDW phase, as the identified bulk periodic distortions cannot be\nrealized in 2D. This behavior sets this material apart from other transition\nmetal dichalcogenide materials, which exhibit a charge density wave phase down\nto the 2D limit. As CDW in TMDC materials is considered to compete with\nsuperconductivity, the lack of CDW in monolayer CuS$_2$ suggests the\npossibility of enhanced superconductivity relative to other transition metal\ndichalcogenides. Overall, our work identifies CuS$_2$ as a previously\nunrealized candidate to study interplay of superconductivity, CDW order, and\ndimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

We decompose the IR-to-radio\nspectral energy distribution (SED), sampled in 51 bands, using (i) a model\ncomprised of two-temperature modified blackbodies (MBB) and radio power-laws\nand (ii) a semi-analytic model, which also accounts for emission from a clumpy\ntorus. The latter is more realistic but requires a well-sampled SED, as\npossible here. In the former model, we find temperatures of T_warm = 296^17_15\nK and T_cold = 110^3_3 K for the warm and cold dust components, respectively.\nThis model suggests that the cold dust component dominates the FIR energy\nbudget (66%) but contributes only 17% to the total IR luminosity.

Accounting for the torus' contribution to the FIR\nluminosity, we find a lensing-corrected star formation rate of\nSFR=3075x(4/mu_L) Msun yr^-1. We find that the central quasar contributes 30%\nto the FIR luminosity but dominates the total IR luminosity (93%). The 30%\ncorrection is in contrast to the 90% reported in previous work.

However, the performance of detecting fake news only from\nnews content is generally limited as fake news pieces are written to mimic true\nnews. In the real world, news pieces spread through propagation networks on\nsocial media. The news propagation networks usually involve multi-levels. In\nthis paper, we study the challenging problem of investigating and exploiting\nnews hierarchical propagation network on social media for fake news detection.\n  In an attempt to understand the correlations between news propagation\nnetworks and fake news, first, we build a hierarchical propagation network from\nmacro-level and micro-level of fake news and true news; second, we perform a\ncomparative analysis of the propagation network features of linguistic,\nstructural and temporal perspectives between fake and real news, which\ndemonstrates the potential of utilizing these features to detect fake news;\nthird, we show the effectiveness of these propagation network features for fake\nnews detection.

We take a viewpoint\nclose to that of F. Cianfrani and G. Montani [Phys. Rev.

We then mend their approach by adding the\nmissing degrees of freedom to the solution and give a complete description of\nthe resulting theory, which preserves Lorentz invariance but turns out to be\nendowed with a noncanonical symplectic structure. Later on and without\nresorting to any gauge condition, we perform a Darboux transformation to bring\nthis theory into a canonical form. Finally, we show that in the time gauge both\nformulations, namely the noncanonical and the canonical ones, lead to the\nAshtekar-Barbero variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 19:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

Based on previous studies, this galaxy hosts a ~1x10^9\nM_sun black hole and has a star-formation rate of ~1500 M_sun/yr. The\nunprecedented high resolution of the observations reveals a complex morphology\nof gas within 3kpc of the accreting central black hole. The gas has a high\nvelocity dispersion with little ordered motion along the line of sight, as\nwould be expected from gas accretion that has yet to settle in a disk. In\naddition, we find the presence of [CII] cavities in the gas distribution (with\ndiameters of ~0.5kpc), offset from the central black hole. This unique\ndistribution and kinematics cannot be explained by a simple model. Plausible\nscenarios are that the gas is located in a truncated or warped disk, or the\nholes are created by interactions with nearby galaxies or due to energy\ninjection into the gas. In the latter case, the energy required to form the\ncavities must originate from the central active galactic nucleus, as the\nrequired energy far exceeds the energy output expected from supernovae. This\nenergy input into the gas, however, does not inhibit the high rate of\nstar-formation.

Successive-cancellation-based (SC-based)\ndecoders, such as SC list (SCL) and SC flip (SCF), provide a reasonable error\nperformance for polar codes at the cost of low decoding speed. Fast SC-based\ndecoders, such as Fast-SSC, Fast-SSCL, and Fast-SSCF, identify the special\nconstituent codes in a polar code graph off-line, produce a list of operations,\nstore the list in memory, and feed the list to the decoder to decode the\nconstituent codes in order efficiently, thus increasing the decoding speed.\nHowever, the list of operations is dependent on the code rate and as the rate\nchanges, a new list is produced, making fast SC-based decoders not\nrate-flexible. In this paper, we propose a completely rate-flexible fast\nSC-based decoder by creating the list of operations directly in hardware, with\nlow implementation complexity. We further propose a hardware architecture\nimplementing the proposed method and show that the area occupation of the\nrate-flexible fast SC-based decoder in this paper is only $38\\%$ of the total\narea of the memory-based base-line decoder when 5G code rates are supported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 19:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The two-phase Riemann\nproblem is first constructed to handle the pairwise interaction between fluid\nparticles, then modified for the fluid-wall interaction to impose the solid\nwall boundary condition. Since the method uses the same artificial speed of\nsound for both heavy and light phases, the computational efficiency increases\ngreatly.

We\naddress the problem by focussing on a prototype of such ensemble system,\nnamely, the ensemble of Bloch equations. The dynamics of the equations are\nstructurally identical, but show variations in Larmor dispersion and radio\nfrequency (rf) inhomogeneity. We assume that the initial state of every\nindividual system is unknown and, moreover, the population density of these\nindividual systems is also unknown. Furthermore, we assume that at any time,\nthere is only one scalar measurement output at our disposal. The measurement\noutput integrates a certain observation function, common to all individual\nsystems, over the continuum ensemble. The observability problem we pose in the\npaper is thus the following: Whether one is able to use the common control\ninput (i.e., the rf field) and the single measurement output to estimate the\ninitial states of the individual systems and, moreover, to identify the\npopulation density? Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition\nfor the ensemble system to be observable: We show that if the common\nobservation function is any harmonic homogeneous polynomial of positive degree,\nthen the ensemble system is observable. The main focus of the paper is to\ndemonstrate how to leverage tools from representation theory of Lie algebras to\naddress the observability problem. Although the results we establish in the\npaper are for the specific ensemble of Bloch equations, the approach we develop\nalong the analysis can be generalized to investigate observability of other\ngeneral ensembles of nonholonomic control systems with a single, integrated\nmeasurement output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 19:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 20:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

By performing full structural optimization with hybrid\nfunctionals and neglecting spin polarization, we find that a substantial\ndimerization ($0.090$ {\\AA} / $0.076$ {\\AA} bond disproportionation in the\nPBE0/HSE06) occurs on the chains; a structural effect absent in calculations\nbased on the LDA/GGA functionals.

The\nsingle-particle direct gap is $1.7$ eV ($1.0$ eV) in the PBE0 (HSE06),\ncomparable with the experimental optical gap of $1.47$ eV, and on the\nlarger(smaller) side of the estimated experimental single particle gap window\nof 1.57-1.87 eV, after inclusion of excitonic effects.

This work is primarily motivated by fraud detection, where attackers\nslightly modify tokenized strings, e.g., names on accounts, to create numerous\nidentities that she can use to defraud service providers, e.g., Google, and\nLinkedIn. To detect such attacks, all the accounts are pair-wise compared, and\nthe resulting similar accounts are considered suspicious and are further\ninvestigated. Comparing the tokenized-string features of a large number of\naccounts requires an intuitive tokenized-string distance that can detect subtle\nedits introduced by an adversary, and a very scalable algorithm. This is not\nachievable by existing distance measure that are unintuitive, hard to tune, and\nwhose join algorithms are serial and hence unscalable. We define a novel\nintuitive distance measure between tokenized strings, Normalized Setwise\nLevenshtein Distance (NSLD).

Tumor biopsy\nbeing challenging for brain tumor patients, noninvasive imaging techniques like\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been extensively employed in diagnosing\nbrain tumors. Therefore automated systems for the detection and prediction of\nthe grade of tumors based on MRI data becomes necessary for assisting doctors\nin the framework of augmented intelligence. In this paper, we thoroughly\ninvestigate the power of Deep ConvNets for classification of brain tumors using\nmulti-sequence MR images. We propose novel ConvNet models, which are trained\nfrom scratch, on MRI patches, slices, and multi-planar volumetric slices. The\nsuitability of transfer learning for the task is next studied by applying two\nexisting ConvNets models (VGGNet and ResNet) trained on ImageNet dataset,\nthrough fine-tuning of the last few layers.

A\ntimely question, given recent advances in the development of thermally\nactivated delayed fluorescence materials, is whether strong light-matter\ncoupling can be used to invert the ordering of singlet and triplet states and,\nin addition, enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. Here, we\ndemonstrate a complete inversion of the singlet lower polariton and triplet\nexcited states. We also unambiguously measure the RISC rate in strongly-coupled\norganic microcavities and find that, regardless of the large energy level\nshifts, it is unchanged compared to films of the bare molecules. This\nobservation is a consequence of slow RISC to the lower polariton due to the\ndelocalized nature of the state across many molecules and an inability to\ncompete with RISC to the dark exciton reservoir, which occurs at a rate\ncomparable to that in bare molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 21:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

Envisioned applications range from the realization of\nphotonic gates for quantum information processing to synthesis of photonic\nquantum materials for investigation of strongly-correlated driven-dissipative\nsystems. Polaritonics, based on the strong coupling of photons to atomic or\nelectronic excitations in an optical resonator, has emerged as a promising\napproach to implement those tasks. Recent experiments demonstrated the onset of\nquantum correlations in the exciton-polariton system, showing that strong\npolariton blockade could be achieved if interactions were an order of magnitude\nstronger. Here, we report time resolved four-wave mixing experiments on a\ntwo-dimensional electron system embedded in an optical cavity, demonstrating\nthat polariton-polariton interactions are strongly enhanced when the electrons\nare initially in a fractional quantum Hall state. Our experiments indicate that\nin addition to strong correlations in the electronic ground state,\nexciton-electron interactions leading to the formation of polaron polaritons\nplay a key role in enhancing the nonlinear optical response. Besides potential\napplications in realization of strongly interacting photonic systems, our\nfindings suggest that nonlinear optical measurements could provide information\nabout fractional quantum Hall states that is not accessible in linear optical\nresponse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 22:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

We focus on the inherent role of photonic spin in\nnon-reciprocal gyroelectric media, ie. magnetized metals or magnetized\ninsulators. We first review the concept of a Maxwell Hamiltonian in\nnon-reciprocal media, which immediately reveals that the gyrotropic coefficient\nbehaves as a photon mass in two dimensions. Similar to the Dirac mass, this\nphotonic mass opens bandgaps in the energy dispersion of bulk propagating\nwaves. Within these bulk photonic bandgaps, three distinct classes of\nMaxwellian edge waves exist - each arising from subtle differences in boundary\nconditions. On one hand, the edge wave solutions are rigorous photonic analogs\nof Jackiw-Rebbi electronic edge states. On the other hand, for the exact same\nsystem, they can be high frequency photonic counterparts of the integer quantum\nHall effect, familiar at zero frequency. Our Hamiltonian approach also predicts\nthe existence of a third distinct class of Maxwellian edge wave exhibiting\ntopological protection. The Maxwellian edge state in this unique\n\\textit{quantum gyroelectric phase of matter} necessarily requires a sign\nchange in gyrotropy arising from non-locality (spatial dispersion). A signature\nproperty of these topological electromagnetic edge states is that they are\noblivious to the contacting medium, ie. they occur at the interface of the\nquantum gyroelectric phase and any medium (even vacuum). Furthermore, the\nMaxwellian spin waves exhibit photonic spin-1 quantization in exact analogy\nwith their supersymmetric spin-\\sfrac{1}{2} counterparts. The goal of this\npaper is to discuss these three foundational classes of edge waves in a unified\nperspective while providing in-depth derivations, taking into account\nnon-locality and various boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 00:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

In an effort to bridge this knowledge gap, we perform here\ncorrelated low-frequency noise (LFN) and impedance spectroscopy (IS)\ncharacterization that elucidates carrier kinetics in operating perovskite solar\ncells.

Most existing methods rely on\nmulti-stage optimizations in a layer-wise manner for iteratively pruning and\nretraining which may not be optimal and may be computation intensive. Besides,\nthese methods are designed for pruning a specific structure, such as filter or\nblock structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this\npaper, we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes\nfilters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish\nthis, we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by\ndefining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the\noutput of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the\noptimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL), which learns a\nsparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more\nscaling factors in the soft mask to zero, the fast iterative\nshrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably\nremove the corresponding structures.

This\npipeline was tested through an extensive simulation study and 6 cadaveric\nsurgeries. Using osteotomy boundaries in the fluoroscopic images, the\npreoperative plan is refined to more accurately match the intraoperative shape.\nResults: In simulation, average fragment pose errors were 1.3{\\deg}/1.7 mm when\nthe planned fragment matched the intraoperative fragment, 2.2{\\deg}/2.1 mm when\nthe plan was not updated to match the true shape, and 1.9{\\deg}/2.0 mm when the\nfragment shape was intraoperatively estimated.

Recently, the minimum variance\ndistortionless response (MVDR) beamforming has widely been used because it\nworks well if the steering vector of speech and the spatial covariance matrix\n(SCM) of noise are given. To estimating such spatial information, conventional\nstudies take a supervised approach that classifies each time-frequency (TF) bin\ninto noise or speech by training a deep neural network (DNN).

When the goal is to minimize the mean flow time of a\nset of jobs, it is usually the case that one wants to complete short jobs\nbefore long jobs. However, since jobs usually cannot be parallelized with\nperfect efficiency, granting strict priority to the short jobs can result in\nvery low system efficiency which in turn hurts the mean flow time across jobs.\nIn this paper, we derive the optimal policy for allocating servers to jobs at\nevery moment in time in order to minimize mean flow time across jobs.

We uncover and analyze three surprising performance slowdowns induced by\nlower layers that result in HDFS read throughput loss. First, intrinsic\nslowdown affects reads from every new file system extent for a variable amount\nof time. Second, temporal slowdown appears temporarily and periodically and is\nworkload-agnostic. Third, in permanent slowdown, some files can individually\nand permanently become slower after a period of time. We analyze the impact of\nthese slowdowns on HDFS and show significant throughput loss. Individually,\neach of the slowdowns can cause a read throughput loss of 10-15%. However,\ntheir effect is cumulative. When all slowdowns happen concurrently, read\nthroughput drops by as much as 30%. We further analyze mitigation techniques\nand show that two of the three slowdowns could be addressed via increased IO\nrequest parallelism in the lower layers. Unfortunately, HDFS cannot\nautomatically adapt to use such additional parallelism. Our results point to a\nneed for adaptability in storage stacks. The reason is that an access pattern\nthat maximizes performance in the common case is not necessarily the same one\nthat can mask performance fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 03:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

It can hardly be applied to other\nlearning tasks such as regression trees because extending the BSP-Tree process\nto a higher dimensional space is nontrivial. This paper is the first attempt to\nextend the BSP-Tree process to a d-dimensional (d>2) space. We propose to\ngenerate a cutting hyperplane, which is assumed to be parallel to d-2\ndimensions, to cut each node in the d-dimensional BSP-tree. By designing a\nsubtle strategy to sample two free dimensions from d dimensions, the extended\nBSP-Tree process can inherit the essential self-consistency property from the\noriginal version. Based on the extended BSP-Tree process, an ensemble model,\nwhich is named the BSP-Forest, is further developed for regression tasks.\nThanks to the retained self-consistency property, we can thus significantly\nreduce the geometric calculations in the inference stage. Compared to its\ncounterpart, the Mondrian Forest, the BSP-Forest can achieve similar\nperformance with fewer cuts due to its flexibility.

Third, the model suffers\nfrom over-adaptation (similar to overfitting when training with a few data\nexample) and instability risk that may lead to degraded detection performance\nin the target domain. To address these challenges, we first introduce a pairing\nmechanism over source and target features to alleviate the issue of\ninsufficient target domain samples.

Such safety applications require high\nthroughput and short delay, which cannot be achieved by conventional microwave\nvehicular communication systems. Therefore, millimeter-wave (mmWave)\ncommunications are considered to be a key technology for sharing perceptual\ndata because of their wide bandwidth. One of the challenges of data sharing in\nmmWave communications is broadcasting because narrow-beam directional antennas\nare used to obtain high gain. Because many vehicles should share their\nperceptual data to others within a short time frame in order to enlarge the\nareas that can be perceived based on shared perceptual data, an efficient\nscheduling for concurrent transmission that improves spatial reuse is required\nfor perceptual data sharing. This paper proposes a data sharing algorithm that\nemploys a graph-based concurrent transmission scheduling. The proposed\nalgorithm realizes concurrent transmission to improve spatial reuse by\ndesigning a rule that is utilized to determine if the two pairs of transmitters\nand receivers interfere with each other by considering the radio propagation\ncharacteristics of narrow-beam antennas. A prioritization method that considers\nthe geographical information in perceptual data is also designed to enlarge\nperceivable areas in situations where data sharing time is limited and not all\ndata can be shared. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\ndoubles the area of the cooperatively perceivable region compared with a\nconventional algorithm that does not consider mmWave communications because the\nproposed algorithm achieves high-throughput transmission by improving spatial\nreuse. The prioritization also enlarges the perceivable region by a maximum of\n20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 08:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

Here we show that\nthe gap opening due to a sublattice symmetry breaking has also a profound\nimpact on the polar response of graphene. By combining ab-initio calculations\nand analytical modelling we show that for realistic band-gap values\n($\\Delta\\lesssim 0.5$ eV) the piezoelectric coefficient and the Born effective\ncharge of graphene attain a giant value, independent on the gap. In particular\nthe piezoelectric coefficient per layer of gapped mono- and bilayer graphene is\nthree times larger than that of a large-gap full polar insulator as hexagonal\nBoron Nitride (h-BN) monolayer, and 30\\% larger than that of a polar\nsemiconductor as MoS$_2$. This surprising result indicates that piezoelectric\nacoustic-phonons scattering can be relevant to model charge transport and\ncharge-carrier relaxation in gated bilayer graphene. The independence of the\npiezoelectric coefficient and of the Born effective charge on the gap value\nfollows from the connection between the polar response and the valley Chern\nnumber of gapped Dirac electrons, made possible by the effective gauge-field\ndescription of the electron-lattice/strain coupling in these systems.

Gyrotaxis has, in recent years, become a paradigmatic\nmodel for phytoplankton motility in flows. The essential attractiveness of this\npeculiar form of motility is the availability of a mechanistic description\nwhich, despite its simplicity, revealed predictive, rich in phenomenology,\neasily complemented to include the effects of shape, feed-back on the fluid and\nstochasticity (e.g. in cell orientation). In this review we consider recent\ntheoretical, numerical and experimental results to discuss how, depending on\nflow properties, gyrotaxis can produce inhomogeneous phytoplankton\ndistributions on a wide range of scales, from millimeters to kilometers, in\nboth laminar and turbulent flows. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon of\ngyrotactic trapping in nonlinear shear flows and in fractal clustering in\nturbulent flows.

Our method is\nsummarized as follows. First, we store the binary values of the monochrome\nimage of target roadmap (one and zero represent the road and the other areas,\nrespectively) in the two-dimensional square map. Second, we recursively divide\nthe square map into sub-leafs by a quadtree until the summed-up value of pixels\nincluded inside the leaf becomes equal to or less than one. Third, we gradually\nremove the distal leaves that are adjacent to the leaves whose depths are\nshallower than the distal leaf. After that, we trace the remaining distal\nleaves of the tree using Morton's space-filling curve, while selecting the\nleaves that keep a certain distance among the previously selected leaves as the\nnodes of the graph. Finally, each selected node searches the neighboring nodes\nand stores them as the edges of the graph. We demonstrate our method by\ngenerating a centerline graph from a complex roadmap of a real-world airport\nand by carrying out a typical network analysis using Dijkstra's method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 09:34:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 17:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

The decoherence of the initial quantum correlation due to the noisy\nchannels and the acceleration process is investigated by means of Wigner\nfunction. The negative (positive) behavior of the Wigner function predicts the\ngain of the quantum (classical) correlations. Based on the upper and lower\nbounds of the Wigner function, the entangled initial state loses its quantum\ncorrelation due the acceleration process and the strengths of the noisy\nchannels.

While the process of convergent orbital\nmigration is expected to routinely yield resonant planetary systems, previous\nanalyses have shown that the semi-major axes of initially resonant pairs of\nplanets will gradually diverge under the influence of long-term energy damping,\nproducing an overabundance of planetary period ratios in slight excess of exact\ncommensurability. While this feature is clearly evident in the orbital\ndistribution of close-in extrasolar planets, the existing theoretical picture\nis limited to the specific case of the planetary three-body problem. In this\nstudy, we generalise the framework of dissipative divergence of resonant orbits\nto multi-resonant chains, and apply our results to the current observational\ncensus of well-characterised three-planet systems. Focusing on the 2:1 and 3:2\ncommensurabilities, we identify three 3-planet systems, whose current orbital\narchitecture is consistent with an evolutionary history wherein convergent\nmigration first locks the planets into a multi-resonant configuration and\nsubsequent dissipation repels the orbits away from exact commensurability.\nNevertheless, we find that the architecture of the overall sample of multi\nplanetary systems is incompatible with this simple scenario, suggesting that\nadditional physical mechanisms must play a dominant role during the early\nstages of planetary systems' dynamical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 12:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Reasoning at\nan abstract level is not as expensive as exploring the entire solution space.\nSMT solvers use efficient decision procedures which provide proofs for the\nlogical formulas corresponding to the AI model.

In loose analogy with phyllotaxis in\nplants, each step of the cascade can be represented by a rotation and a scaling\nof the interacting triad. Using a constant divergence angle and a constant\nscaling factor, one obtains a family of such fractals depending on the distance\nof interactions. Scaling factors in such sequences are given by the square\nroots of known ratios such as the plastic ratio, the supergolden ratio or some\nsmall Pisot numbers. While spiral chains can represent mono-fractal models of\nself-similar cascade, which can span a very large range in wave-number domain\nwith good angular coverage, it is also possible that spiral chains or chains of\nconsecutive triads play an important role in the cascade. As numerical models,\nthe spiral chain models based on decimated Fourier coefficients have problems\nsuch as the dual cascade being overwhelmed by statistical chain equipartition\ndue to almost stochastic evolution of the complex phases. A generic spiral\nchain model based on evolution of energy is proposed, which is shown to recover\nthe dual cascade behavior in two-dimensional turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

The variability of the Wolf-Rayet star EZ CMa has been documented\nfor close to half a century, and a clear periodicity of $\\sim$3.7 days is\nestablished. However, all attempts to prove that it is a binary have failed\nbecause the photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric variations are not\ncoherent over more than a few orbital cycles.\n  Aims. In this letter we show that the lack of coherence in the variability\ncan be explained with a very rapid apsidal motion in a binary orbit.}\n  Methods. We measured the times of minima in a recently published\nexceptionally long photometric light curve obtained by the Toronto\n{\\emph{BRITE}} satellite. The apsidal motion and the system eccentricity are\ndetermined from the length of the time intervals between these minima, which\nalternate in their duration, following a pattern that is clearly associated\nwith apsidal motion. These minima are superposed on brightness enhancements of\nthe emission from a shock zone, which occur at about the times of periastron\nphases.\n  Results. We determine the orbital periodicity, $P_{a}=3.63\\, $d, and the\nperiod of the apsidal motion, $U\\simeq 100\\, $d, which together yield an\naverage sidereal period of $P_{s}=3.77\\,$d.

We demonstrate that by introducing a fast apsidal motion, the\nbasic photometric variability is very well explained. The binary nature of EZ\nCMa is now established. This might imply that other apparently single\nWolf-Rayet stars that emit hard X-rays, similar to EZ CMa, are also binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Such loops are often irregular and a balanced\nexecution of their loop iterations is critical for achieving high performance.\nHowever, several factors may lead to an imbalanced load execution, such as\nproblem characteristics, algorithmic, and systemic variations. Dynamic loop\nself-scheduling (DLS) techniques are devised to mitigate these factors, and\nconsequently, improve application performance. On distributed-memory systems,\nDLS techniques can be implemented using a hierarchical master-worker execution\nmodel and are, therefore, called hierarchical DLS techniques. These techniques\nself-schedule loop iterations at two levels of hardware parallelism: across and\nwithin compute nodes. Hybrid programming approaches that combine the message\npassing interface (MPI) with open multi-processing (OpenMP) dominate the\nimplementation of hierarchical DLS techniques. The MPI-3 standard includes the\nfeature of sharing memory regions among MPI processes. This feature introduced\nthe MPI+MPI approach that simplifies the implementation of parallel scientific\napplications. The present work designs and implements hierarchical DLS\ntechniques by exploiting the MPI+MPI approach. Four well-known DLS techniques\nare considered in the evaluation proposed herein. The results indicate certain\nperformance advantages of the proposed approach compared to the hybrid\nMPI+OpenMP approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

The instantaneous and continuous matching of power supply with demand\nis a key factor explaining its volatility. During periods of high demand,\ncostlier generation capabilities are utilised since electricity cannot be\nstored and this has the impact of driving prices up very quickly. Furthermore,\nthe non-storability also complicates physical hedging. Owing to these, the\nproblem of joint price-quantity risk in electricity markets is a commonly\nstudied theme.\n  We propose using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to tackle this problem since GPs\nprovide a versatile and elegant non-parametric approach for regression and\ntime-series modelling. However, GPs scale poorly with the amount of training\ndata due to a cubic complexity. These considerations suggest that knowledge\ntransfer between price and load is vital for effective hedging, and that a\ncomputationally efficient method is required. To this end, we use the\ncoregionalized (or multi-task) sparse GPs which addresses the aforementioned\nissues.\n  To gauge the performance of our model, we use an average-load strategy as\ncomparator. The latter is a robust approach commonly used by industry. If the\nspot and load are uncorrelated and Gaussian, then hedging with the expected\nload will result in the minimum variance position.\n  Our main contributions are twofold. Firstly, in developing a coregionalized\nsparse GP-based approach for hedging. Secondly, in demonstrating that our\nmodel-based strategy outperforms the comparator, and can thus be employed for\neffective hedging in electricity markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 14:48:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 10:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

While\nembodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the\nidealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the\nmore recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still\nheavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions.\nPreviously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly\nresonates with the separation principle of control theory.

For a large scale LP problem with data matrix $A$\nthat is dense (possibly structured) or whose corresponding normal matrix $AA^T$\nhas a dense Cholesky factor (even with re-ordering), these solvers may require\nexcessive computational cost and/or extremely heavy memory usage in each\ninterior-point iteration.

To reconcile theory and fact, evolutionists have proposed novel\ntheories that extend natural selection to levels and time frames not justified\nby the original structure of Darwin's theory. To extend evolutionary theory\nwithout violating the most basic tenets of Darwinism, I here identify a\nseparate struggle and an alternative evolutionary force.

By analogy to\nhuman economies, natural selection plays the role of nature's inventor,\ngradually fashioning inventions to the situation at hand, while natural reward\nplays the role of nature's entrepreneur, choosing which inventions to first\ndisseminate to large markets. Natural reward leads to progress through a\nprocess of invention-conquest macroevolution, in which the dual forces of\nnatural selection and natural reward create and disseminate major innovations.\nOver vast time frames, natural reward drives the advancement of life by a\nprocess of extinction-replacement megaevolution that releases constraints on\nprogress and increases the innovativeness of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 15:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

Although a smaller line of work considers physical\nadversarial attacks, in all cases these involve manipulating the object of\ninterest, e.g., putting a physical sticker on an object to misclassify it, or\nmanufacturing an object specifically intended to be misclassified. In this\nwork, we consider an alternative question: is it possible to fool deep\nclassifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain type, by physically\nmanipulating the camera itself? We show that by placing a carefully crafted and\nmainly-translucent sticker over the lens of a camera, one can create universal\nperturbations of the observed images that are inconspicuous, yet misclassify\ntarget objects as a different (targeted) class. To accomplish this, we propose\nan iterative procedure for both updating the attack perturbation (to make it\nadversarial for a given classifier), and the threat model itself (to ensure it\nis physically realizable). For example, we show that we can achieve\nphysically-realizable attacks that fool ImageNet classifiers in a targeted\nfashion 49.6% of the time. This presents a new class of physically-realizable\nthreat models to consider in the context of adversarially robust machine\nlearning.

We propose tiered latent representations and latent spaces\nfor molecular graphs as a simple way to explicitly represent and utilize\ngroups, which consist of the atom (node) tier, the group tier and the molecule\n(graph) tier. Specifically, we propose an architecture for learning tiered\nlatent representations and latent spaces using graph autoencoders, graph neural\nnetworks, differentiable group pooling and the membership matrix. We discuss\nits various components, major challenges and related work, for both a\ndeterministic and a probabilistic model. We also briefly discuss the usage and\nexploration of tiered latent spaces.

Consequently, methods for generating microstructural\nsamples are increasingly crucial to advanced numerical analyses. We extend\nSonon et al.'s unified framework, developed originally for generating\nparticulate and foam-like microstructural geometries of Periodic Unit Cells, to\nnon-periodic microstructural representations based on the formalism of Wang\ntiles. This formalism has been recently proposed in order to generalize the\nPeriodic Unit Cell approach, enabling a fast synthesis of arbitrarily large,\nstochastic microstructural samples from a handful of domains with predefined\ncompatibility constraints. However, a robust procedure capable of designing\ncomplex, three-dimensional, foam-like and cellular morphologies of Wang tiles\nhas not yet been proposed. This contribution fills the gap by significantly\nbroadening the applicability of the tiling concept.\n  Since the original Sonon et al.'s framework builds on a random sequential\naddition of particles enhanced with an implicit representation of particle\nboundaries by the level-set field, we first devise an analysis based on a\nconnectivity graph of a tile set, resolving the question where a particle\nshould be copied when it intersects a tile boundary. Next, we introduce several\nmodifications to the original algorithm that are necessary to ensure\nmicrostructural compatibility in the generalized periodicity setting of Wang\ntiles. Having established a universal procedure for generating tile\nmorphologies, we compare strictly aperiodic and stochastic sets with the same\ncardinality in terms of reducing the artificial periodicity in reconstructed\nmicrostructural samples.
