This paper presents a\nconfiguration-free lossless compression algorithm which addresses both\nlimitations, by compressing the data on-the-fly in the controlling\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA). Thus the difference predicted trace\ncompression (DPTC) can easily be used directly in front-end electronics. The\nmethod first computes the differences between consecutive samples in the\ntraces, thereby concentrating the most probable values around zero. The values\nare then stored as groups of four, with only the necessary least-significant\nbits in a variable-length code, packed in a stream of 32-bit words. To evaluate\nthe efficiency, the storage cost of compressed traces is modeled as a baseline\ncost including the ADC noise, and a cost for pulses that depends on their\namplitude and width. The free parameters and the validity of the model are\ndetermined by comparing it with the results of compressing a large set of\nartificial traces with varying characteristics.

This paper formalizes the three concerns with the aim of accurate,\ncomfortable and human-like driving. Three contributions are made in this paper.\nFirst, numerical map data from HERE Technologies are employed for more accurate\ndriving; a set of map features which are believed to be relevant to driving are\nengineered to navigate better. Second, the learning procedure is improved from\na pointwise prediction to a sequence-based prediction and passengers' comfort\nmeasures are embedded into the learning algorithm.

The majority of\nthese signals will be relatively weak, making the precision measurement of\nsubtle effects, such as deviations from general relativity, challenging in the\nindividual events. However, many weak observations can be combined into precise\ninferences, if information from the individual signals is combined in an\nappropriate way. In this study we revisit common methods for combining multiple\ngravitational wave observations to test general relativity, namely (i)\nmultiplying the individual likelihoods of beyond-general-relativity parameters\nand (ii) multiplying the Bayes Factor in favor of general relativity from each\nevent. We discuss both methods and show that they make stringent assumptions\nabout the modified theory of gravity they test. In particular, the former\nassumes that all events share the same beyond-general-relativity parameter,\nwhile the latter assumes that the theory of gravity has a new unrelated\nparameter for each detection. We show that each method can fail to detect\ndeviations from general relativity when the modified theory being tested\nviolates these assumptions. We argue that these two methods are the extreme\nlimits of a more generic framework of hierarchical inference on hyperparameters\nthat characterize the underlying distribution of single-event parameters. We\nillustrate our conclusions first using a simple model of Gaussian likelihoods,\nand also by applying parameter estimation techniques to a simulated dataset of\ngravitational waveforms in a model where the graviton is massive.

This seems natural for the visible sector, that has been in\nthermal contact and tightly coupled in the primeval Universe. The dark sector,\non the other hand, does not have any non-gravitational interaction known to\ndate and therefore, there is no a priori reason to impose that it is comoving\nwith ordinary matter. In this work we explore the consequences of relaxing this\nassumption and study the cosmology of non-comoving fluids. We show that it is\npossible to construct a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with a collection\nof fluids moving with non-relativistic velocities. Our model extends\n$\\Lambda$CDM with the addition of a single free parameter $\\beta_0$, the\ninitial velocity of the visible sector with respect to the frame that observes\na homogeneous and isotropic universe. This modification gives rise to a rich\nphenomenology, while being consistent with current observations for\n$\\beta_0<1.6\\times 10^{-3} \\text{(95% CL)}$. This work establishes the general\nframework to describe a non-comoving cosmology and extracts its first\nobservational consequences for large-scale structure. Among the observable\neffects, we find sizeable modifications in the density-velocity and\ndensity-lensing potential cross-correlation spectra. These corrections give\nrise to deviations from statistical isotropy with a dipolar structure. The\nrelative motion between the different fluids also couples the vector and scalar\nmodes, the latter acting as sources for metric vector modes and vorticity for\nall the species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 16:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The key is to blend ideas from nested\ndissection, domain decomposition, and high-order characteristic of HDG\ndiscretizations. Specifically, we first create a coarse solver by eliminating\nand/or limiting the front growth in nested dissection. This is accomplished by\nprojecting the trace data into a sequence of same or high-order polynomials on\na set of increasingly $h-$coarser edges/faces. We then combine the coarse\nsolver with a block-Jacobi fine scale solver to form a two-level\nsolver/preconditioner. Numerical experiments indicate that the performance of\nthe resulting two-level solver/preconditioner depends only on the smoothness of\nthe solution and is independent of the nature of the PDE under consideration.\nWhile the proposed algorithms are developed within the HDG framework, they are\napplicable to other hybrid(ized) high-order finite element methods.

These objects, alternatively referred to as post-starburst, E+A or\nk+a galaxies, are now known to occur in all environments and at all redshifts,\nwith many exhibiting compact morphologies and low-surface brightness features\nindicative of past galaxy mergers. They are commonly thought to represent\ngalaxies that are transitioning from blue to red sequence, making them critical\nto our understanding of the origins of galaxy bimodality. However, recent\nobservational studies have questioned this simple interpretation. From\nobservations alone, it is challenging to disentangle the different mechanisms\nthat lead to the quenching of star formation in galaxies. Here we present\nexamples of three different evolutionary pathways that lead to galaxies with\nstrong Balmer absorption lines in the EAGLE simulation: classical blue-to-red\nquenching, blue-to-blue cycle and red-to-red rejuvenation. The first two are\nfound in both post-starburst galaxies and galaxies with truncated star\nformation. Each pathway is consistent with scenarios hypothesised for\nobservational samples. The fact that 'post-starburst' signatures can be\nattained via various evolutionary channels explains the diversity of observed\nproperties, and lends support to the idea that slower quenching channels are\nimportant at low redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 17:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

In strong magnetic fields, the inter-vortex distance can become short\nenough for vortex cores to overlap, giving rise to long ranged textures. We\nshow that spin orbit coupling (SOC) can modify the interaction between vortex\ncores to give rise to undulating competing order fields. We illustrate this\nusing the SO(3) theory of competing orders, wherein superconductivity and a\nscalar order form a three-component vector field. We consider a spherical\nsurface with a radial magnetic flux that creates two vortices. We find\nstationary solutions where both vortex cores develop competing order in (a) the\nsame sense, and (b) opposite senses.

Our high-cadence\nspectroscopic monitoring captures the appearance of a blue, featureless\ncontinuum, followed several weeks later by the appearance of broad Balmer\nemission lines. This timescale is generally consistent with the expected light\ntravel time between the central engine and the broad-line emission region in\n(persistent) broad-line AGN. Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy reveals no\nevidence for broad UV emission lines (e.g., CIV1549, CIII]1909, MgII2798),\nprobably owing to dust in the broad-line emission region. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first case where the lag between the change in continuum\nand in broad-line emission of a \"changing-look\" AGN has been temporally\nresolved. The nature and timescales of the photometric and spectral evolution\ndisfavor both a change in line-of-sight obscuration and a change of the overall\nrate of gas inflow as driving the drastic spectral transformations seen in this\nAGN. Although the peak luminosity and timescales are consistent with those of\ntidal disruption events seen in inactive galaxies, the spectral properties are\nnot. The X-ray emission displays a markedly different behavior, with frequent\nflares on timescales of hours to days, and will be presented in a companion\npublication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 18:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Using full spectral fitting and calibrated\nregularization techniques we show how we can accurately derive a galaxy's mass\ndistribution in age-metallicity space and further separate this into stellar\npopulations from different chemical enrichment histories. By exploiting the\nfact that accreted lower mass galaxies will exhibit an offset to lower\nmetallicities at fixed age compared to the in-situ stellar population, we\nquantify the fraction of light that comes from past merger events, that are\nlong since mixed in phase-space and otherwise indistinguishable. Empirical\nage-metallicity relations (AMRs) parameterized for different galaxy masses are\nused to identify the accreted stellar populations and link them back to the\nprogenitor galaxy's stellar mass. This allows us to not only measure the host\ngalaxy's total ex-situ mass fraction ($f_{acc}$), but also quantify the\nrelative amount of accreted material deposited by satellite galaxies of\ndifferent masses, i.e. the accreted satellite mass function in analogy to the\nsubhalo mass function.

We\nextract $H$-band residual features corresponding to the birth, growth, and\nfading of tidal features during different stages and viewing orientations at\nCANDELS depths and resolution. We find that the extracted features at shallow\ndepths have noisy visual appearance and are susceptible to viewing angle\neffects. For a VELA $z\\sim 3$ major merger, we find that James Webb Space\nTelescope NIRCam observations can probe high-redshift tidal features with\nconsiderable advantage over existing $HST$ capabilities. Further quantitative\nanalysis of plausible tidal features extracted with our new software hold\npromise for the robust identification of hallmark merger signatures and\ncorresponding improvements to merger rate constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 18:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

The\n2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) is a peer review assessment of UK\nuniversities, whose results can be taken as benchmarks for bibliometric\nindicators. In this study we use the REF results to investigate whether the ep\nindex and a top percentile of most cited papers could substitute for peer\nreview. The probability that a random university's paper reaches a certain top\npercentile in the global distribution of papers is a power of the ep index,\nwhich can be calculated from the citation-based distribution of university's\npapers in global top percentiles. Making use of the ep index in each university\nand research area, we calculated the ratios between the percentage of\n4-star-rated outputs in REF and the percentages of papers in global top\npercentiles. Then, we fixed the assessment percentile so that the mean ratio\nbetween these two indicators across universities is 1.0. This method was\napplied to four units of assessment in REF: Chemistry, Economics & Econometrics\njoined to Business & Management Studies, and Physics. Some relevant deviations\nfrom the 1.0 ratio could be explained by the evaluation procedure in REF or by\nthe characteristics of the research field; other deviations need specific\nstudies by experts in the research area. The present results indicate that in\nmany research areas the substitution of a top percentile indicator for peer\nreview is possible. However, this substitution cannot be made\nstraightforwardly; more research is needed to establish the conditions of the\nbibliometric assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 19:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

This design strength comes at the cost of large\ndevice footprint due to the poor in-plane localization of optical energy. In\nfully-etched PCSs realized in high index contrast material systems, the\nin-plane localization is greatly improved, but the command over linewidth\nsuffers.

The energetic processes,\nwhich define the state of gas in the CGM, are the same ones that 1) regulate\nstellar growth so that it is not over-efficient, and 2) create the diversity of\ntoday's galaxy colors, SFRs, and morphologies spanning Hubble's Tuning Fork\nDiagram.

However, given the\nextreme brightness ratio and small angular separation between planets and their\nhost stars, the planet signal-to-noise ratio will likely be limited by the\nunwanted coupling of starlight into the fiber. To address this issue, we\nutilize a wavefront control loop and a deformable mirror to systematically\nreject starlight from the fiber by measuring what is transmitted through the\nfiber.

With\nthis framework, one can easily use existing (high order) numerical methods\ndeveloped on Cartesian grids to solve HJB equations on surfaces, with a\ncomputational cost that scales with the dimension of the surfaces. This\nframework also provides a systematic way for solving HJB equations on the\nunstructured point clouds that are sampled from the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 22:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 18:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

Given the rapidly increasing availability of multisensor and\nmultinode measurements, likely recorded on irregular or ad-hoc grids, it would\nbe extremely advantageous to analyze such structured data as graph signals and\nthus benefit from the ability of graphs to incorporate spatial awareness of the\nsensing locations, sensor importance, and local versus global sensor\nassociation. The aim of this lecture note is therefore to establish a common\nlanguage between graph signals, defined on irregular signal domains, and some\nof the most fundamental paradigms in DSP, such as spectral analysis of\nmultichannel signals, system transfer function, digital filter design,\nparameter estimation, and optimal filter design. This is achieved through a\nphysically meaningful and intuitive real-world example of geographically\ndistributed multisensor temperature estimation. A similar spatial multisensor\narrangement is already widely used in Signal Processing curricula to introduce\nminimum variance estimators and Kalman filters \\cite{HM}, and by adopting this\nframework we facilitate a seamless integration of graph theory into the\ncurriculum of existing DSP courses. By bridging the gap between standard\napproaches and graph signal processing, we also show that standard methods can\nbe thought of as special cases of their graph counterparts, evaluated on linear\ngraphs.

In the\ncontext of the next generation of telescopes, a more accurate description of\nchemical profiles may become crucial to interpret observations and gain new\ninsights into atmospheric physics. We explore here the possibility of\nretrieving pressure-dependent chemical profiles from transit spectra, without\ninjecting any priors from theoretical chemical models in our retrievals. The\n\"2-layer\" parameterisation presented here allows for the independent extraction\nof molecular abundances above and below a certain atmospheric pressure.

As an alternative, we\nshall further propose a new adaptive and compact CNN based architecture that\ncan be trained from scratch even on scarce and low-resolution data. Moreover,\nwe conduct quantitative comparative evaluations among the traditional methods,\ntransfer learning-based methods and the proposed adaptive approach for the\nparticular task of cancer detection and identification from scarce and\nlow-resolution histology images. Over the largest benchmark dataset formed for\nthis purpose, the proposed adaptive approach achieved a higher cancer detection\naccuracy with a significant gap, whereas the deep CNNs with transfer learning\nachieved a superior cancer identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 01:02:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 03:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

The\nliterature largely overlooks this sustainability issue of deploying UAV swarm\ndeployment, and we aim to maximize the minimum leftover energy storage among\nall the UAVs after their deployment. Our new energy-saving deployment problem\ncaptures that each UAV's wireless coverage is adjustable by its service\naltitude, and also takes the no-fly-zone (NFZ) constraint into account. Despite\nof this, we propose an optimal energy-saving deployment algorithm by jointly\nbalancing heterogeneous UAVs' flying distances on the ground and final service\naltitudes in the sky.

The Rotation Measures (RM) of extragalactic (EG) sources\nhave been the basis of comprehensive Galactic magnetic field models. Polarised\nextended emission (XE) is also seen along lines of sight through the Galactic\ndisk, and also displays the effects of Faraday rotation. Our aim is to\ninvestigate and understand the relationship between EG and XE RMs near the\nGalactic plane, and to determine how the XE RMs, a hitherto unused resource,\ncan be used as a probe of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We used\npolarisation data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS), observed near\n1420 MHz with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Synthesis\nTelescope. We calculated RMs from a linear fit to the polarisation angles as a\nfunction of wavelength squared in four frequency channels, for both the EG\nsources and the XE. Across the CGPS area, $55^{\\circ} < {\\ell} <193^{\\circ},\n-3^{\\circ} < b < 5^{\\circ}$, the RMs of the XE closely track the RMs of the EG\nsources, with XE RMs about half the value of EG-source RMs. The exceptions are\nplaces where large local HII complexes heavily depolarise more distant\nemission.

In this study, we have performed MC simulations of electron emission\nfrom liquid water in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 keV by using two\ndifferent codes, i.e. a classical MC (CMC) code developed in our laboratory and\nthe Geant4-DNA (G4DNA) code.

Our CMC calculation of\nsecondary electron yield is closer to the experimental data and the energy\ndistribution is reasonable.

GHC\nconstitutes a regime of collapses within collapses, in which small-scale\ncollapses begin at later times, but occur on shorter timescales than\nlarge-scale ones. The difference in timescales allows for most of the clouds'\nmass to be dispersed by feedback from the first massive stars, maintaining the\nglobal star formation rate low. All scales accrete from their parent\nstructures. The main features of GHC are: star-forming MCs are in an\nessentially pressureless regime, which produces filaments that accrete onto\nclumps and cores (\"hubs\"). The filaments constitute the collapse flow from\ncloud to hub scales and may approach a quasi-stationary state; the molecular\nand dense mass fractions of the clouds increase over time; the first (low-mass)\nstars appear several Myr after global contraction began; more massive stars\nappear after a few Myr in massive hubs resulting from the collapse of larger\nscales; the minimum fragment mass may extend well into the brown-dwarf regime;\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion occurs at the protostellar and core scales,\naccounting for a near-Salpeter IMF; the extreme anisotropy of the filamentary\nnetwork explains the difficulty in detecting large-scale infall signatures; the\nbalance between inertial and gravitationally-driven motions in clumps evolves\nduring the contraction; prestellar cores adopt Bonnor-Ebert-like profiles, but\nare contracting ever since early times when they may appear to be unbound and\nto require pressure confinement; stellar clusters develop radial age and mass\nsegregation gradients.

We\ntherefore analyze the effect of detection efficiency on the Fisher information\nand show that there is a transition from low robustness against photon losses\nassociated with quantum interference effects at low field displacements to high\nrobustness against photon losses at high field displacements. The transition\nbetween the two regimes occurs at field shifts proportional to the third power\nof the squeezing factor, indicating that squeezing greatly enhances the phase\ninterval in which quantum effects are relevant in optimal phase estimations\nusing photon resolving detectors. The case under study could thus be understood\nas a `missing link' between genuine multiphoton interference and the\nstraightforward suppression of noise usually associated with squeezed light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 08:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 06:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 04:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Previous methods\nbased on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combine nonlinear activations of\nspatially-invariant kernels to estimate structural details from LR depth and HR\ncolor images, and regress upsampling results directly from the networks. In\nthis paper, we revisit the weighted averaging process that has been widely used\nto transfer structural details from hand-crafted visual features to LR depth\nmaps. We instead learn explicitly sparse and spatially-variant kernels for this\ntask. To this end, we propose a CNN architecture and its efficient\nimplementation, called the deformable kernel network (DKN), that outputs sparse\nsets of neighbors and the corresponding weights adaptively for each pixel.

Yet, with the modern web technologies today, the traditional\nsocial communication topologies have evolved from node-central structures to\nonline cycle-based communities, urgently requiring new network theories and\ntools. Switching the focus from node degrees to network cycles, it could reveal\nmany interesting properties from the perspective of totally homogeneous\nnetworks, or sub-networks in a complex network, especially basic simplexes\n(cliques) such as links and triangles. Clearly, comparing to node degrees it is\nmuch more challenging to deal with network cycles. For studying the latter, a\nnew clique vector space framework is introduced in this paper, where the vector\nspace with a basis consisting of links has the dimension equal to the number of\nlinks, that with a basis consisting of triangles has the dimension equal to the\nnumber of triangles, and so on. These two vector spaces are related through a\nboundary operator, e.g., mapping the boundary of a triangle in one space to the\nsun of three links in the other space. Under the new framework, some important\nconcepts and methodologies from algebraic topology, such as characteristic\nnumber, homology group and Betti number, will have a play in network science\nleading to foreseeable new research directions. As immediate applications, the\npaper illustrates some important characteristics affecting the collective\nbehaviors of complex networks, some new cycle-dependent importance indexes of\nnodes, and implications for network synchronization and brain network analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 08:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 08:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

We use a combination of\nRHESSI imaging and long-duration time integration (up to 40 min) to detect the\nactive regions in the 3-8 keV range during apparently non-flaring times. The\nRHESSI imaging reveals a hot component that originates from the entire active\nregion, as speculated for a nanoflare scenario where the entire active region\nis filled with a large number of unresolved small energy releases. An\nisothermal fit to the RHESSI data gives temperatures around ~7 MK with emission\nmeasure of several times 10^46 cm^-3. Adding EUV and SXR observations taken by\nAIA and XRT, respectively, we derive a differential emission measure (DEM) that\nshows a peak between 2 and 3 MK with a steeply decreasing high-temperature\ntail, similar to what has been previously reported. The derived DEM reveals\nthat a wide range of temperatures contributes to the RHESSI flux (e.g. 40 % of\nthe 4 keV emission being produced by plasma below 5 MK, while emission at 7 keV\nis almost exclusively from plasmas above 5 MK) indicating that the RHESSI\nspectrum should not be fitted with an isothermal. The hot component has a\nrather small emission measure (~0.1 % of the total EM is above 5 MK), and the\nderived thermal energy content is of the order of 10 % for a filling factor of\nunity, or potentially below 1 % for smaller filling factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 08:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Two different mechanisms\nfor the action of the reservoirs are considered. In the first, called ISF, the\ncondition of local equilibrium between reservoir and the lattice is not\nsatisfied. The second mechanism, called DB, implements a detailed balance\ncondition, thus satisfying the local equilibrium property. We provide numerical\nevidence that, for a suitable choice of the temperature (i.e. below the\ncritical temperature of the equilibrium 2D Ising model) and the reservoir\nmagnetizations, in the long time limit the ISF model undergoes a ferromagnetic\nphase transition and gives rise to stationary uphill currents, namely positive\nspins diffuse from the reservoir with lower magnetization to the reservoir with\nhigher magnetization.

Unlike the real face, the 3D face mask is usually made of resin\nmaterials and has a smooth surface, resulting in reflectance differences. So,\nwe propose a novel detection method for 3D face mask presentation attack by\nmodeling reflectance differences based on intrinsic image analysis. In the\nproposed method, the face image is first processed with intrinsic image\ndecomposition to compute its reflectance image. Then, the intensity\ndistribution histograms are extracted from three orthogonal planes to represent\nthe intensity differences of reflectance images between the real face and 3D\nface mask. After that, the 1D convolutional network is further used to capture\nthe information for describing different materials or surfaces react\ndifferently to changes in illumination.

We address the issues of limited correspondences identified\nbetween keypoints only and invisible pixels due to self-occlusion. Unlike\nexisting methods, we propose to estimate dense and intrinsic 3D appearance flow\nto better guide the transfer of pixels between poses. In particular, we wish to\ngenerate the 3D flow from just the reference and target poses. Training a\nnetwork for this purpose is non-trivial, especially when the annotations for 3D\nappearance flow are scarce by nature. We address this problem through a flow\nsynthesis stage. This is achieved by fitting a 3D model to the given pose pair\nand project them back to the 2D plane to compute the dense appearance flow for\ntraining. The synthesized ground-truths are then used to train a feedforward\nnetwork for efficient mapping from the input and target skeleton poses to the\n3D appearance flow. With the appearance flow, we perform feature warping on the\ninput image and generate a photorealistic image of the target pose.

Different from those methods, we\nproposed Hierarchical Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (HAGAN) which\nalternately trains a generator and a discriminator in order to produce a\ndocument representation which is sentiment-distinguishable but\ndomain-indistinguishable. Besides, the HAGAN model applies Bidirectional Gated\nRecurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to encode the contextual information of a word and a\nsentence into the document representation. In addition, the HAGAN model use\nhierarchical attention mechanism to optimize the document representation and\nautomatically capture the pivots and non-pivots. The experiments on Amazon\nreview dataset show the effectiveness of HAGAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 10:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue\nwas identified using non-invasive methods such as surface electromyography,\nnear-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic nerve stimulation and twitch interpolation\ntechnique.Results The number of repetitions was significantly lower in men at\nOPT (14.8$\\pm$3.2) and LONG (15.8$\\pm$5.8) than boys (39.7$\\pm$18.4 and 29.5\n$\\pm$10.2, respectively; p<0.001), while no difference was found at SHORT\nbetween both age groups (boys: 33.7$\\pm$15.4, men: 40.9$\\pm$14.2). At OPT and\nLONG boys showed a lower reduction in the single potentiated twitch (Qtwpot)\nand a greater decrease in the voluntary activation level (VA) than men. At\nSHORT, both populations displayed a moderate Qtwpot decrement and a significant\nVA reduction (p<0.001). The differences in maximal torque between boys and men\nwere almost twice greater at OPT (223.9 N.m) than at SHORT (123.3 N.m) and LONG\n(136.5 N.m).Conclusion The differences in neuromuscular fatigue between\nchildren and adults are dependent on MTU length. Differences in maximal torque\ncould underpin differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults\nat OPT and SHORT. However, at LONG these differences do not seem to be\nexplained by differences in maximal torque.

Our shape dictionary method provides a good trade-off between\nalgorithmic simplicity and faithfulness with respect to the nonlinear geometric\nstructure of Kendall's shape space. Remarkably, it boils down to a classical\ndictionary learning formulation modified using complex weights. Existing\ndictionary learning methods extended to nonlinear spaces either map the\nmanifold to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space or to a tangent space. The first\napproach is unnecessarily heavy in the case of Kendall's shape space and causes\nthe geometrical understanding of shapes to be lost, while the second one\ninduces distortions and theoretical complexity. Our approach does not suffer\nfrom these drawbacks. Instead of embedding the shape space into a linear space,\nwe rely on the hyperplane of centered configurations, including pre-shapes from\nwhich shapes are defined as rotation orbits. In this linear space, the\ndictionary atoms are scaled and rotated using complex weights before summation.\nFurthermore, our formulation is more general than Kendall's original one: it\napplies to discretely-defined configurations of landmarks as well as\ncontinuously-defined interpolating curves. We implemented our algorithm by\nadapting the method of optimal directions combined to a Cholesky-optimized\norder recursive matching pursuit. An interesting feature of our shape\ndictionary is that it produces visually realistic atoms, while guaranteeing\nreconstruction accuracy. Its efficiency can mostly be attributed to a clear\nformulation of the framework with complex numbers. We illustrate the strong\npotential of our approach for the characterization of datasets of shapes up to\nsimilitudes and the analysis of patterns in deforming 2D shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 11:32:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 23:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

This bias was studied, both\ntheoretically and empirically, with respect to a single item. Babaioff et al.\n[EC'18] took a first step at extending this study beyond a single item. They\nproposed a specific formulation of the endowment effect in combinatorial\nsettings, and showed that equilibrium existence with respect to the endowed\nvaluations extends from gross substitutes to submodular valuations, but\nprovably fails to extend to XOS valuations.\n  Extending the endowment effect to combinatorial settings can take different\nforms. In this work, we devise a framework that captures a space of endowment\neffects, upon which we impose a partial order, which preserves endowment\nequilibrium existence. Within this framework, we provide existence and welfare\nguarantees for endowment equilibria corresponding to various endowment effects.\nOur main results are the following:\n  (1) For markets with XOS valuations, we introduce an endowment effect that is\nstronger than that of Babaioff et al., for which an endowment equilibrium is\nguaranteed to exist and gives at least half of the optimal welfare.

Using binary\npresence-absence data, we can evaluate species co-occurrences that help\nelucidate relationships among organisms and environments. To summarize\nsimilarity between occurrences of species, we routinely use the\nJaccard/Tanimoto coefficient, which is the ratio of their intersection to their\nunion. It is natural, then, to identify statistically significant\nJaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, which suggest non-random co-occurrences of\nspecies. However, statistical hypothesis testing using this similarity\ncoefficient has been seldom used or studied.\n  We introduce a hypothesis test for similarity for biological presence-absence\ndata, using the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient. Several key improvements are\npresented including unbiased estimation of expectation and centered\nJaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, that account for occurrence probabilities. We\nderived the exact and asymptotic solutions and developed the bootstrap and\nmeasurement concentration algorithms to compute statistical significance of\nbinary similarity. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that our\nproposed methods produce accurate p-values and false discovery rates. The\nproposed estimation methods are orders of magnitude faster than the exact\nsolution. The proposed methods are implemented in an open source R package\ncalled jaccard (https://cran.r-project.org/package=jaccard).\n  We introduce a suite of statistical methods for the Jaccard/Tanimoto\nsimilarity coefficient, that enable straightforward incorporation of\nprobabilistic measures in analysis for species co-occurrences.

Their diversity calls for a\ngeneral computational approach to predicting their band gaps. However, such an\napproach is still lacking. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) and\nmany-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation to compute the\nquasiparticle or fundamental band gap of a set of ten representative halide\nperovskites: CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPbI$_3$), MAPbBr$_3$, CsSnBr$_3$,\n(MA)$_2$BiTlBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgCl$_6$, Cs$_2$BiAgBr$_6$,\nCs$_2$InAgCl$_6$, Cs$_2$SnBr$_6$, and Cs$_2$Au$_2$I$_6$. Comparing with recent\nmeasurements, we find that a standard generalized gradient exchange-correlation\nfunctional can significantly underestimate the experimental band gaps of these\nperovskites, particularly in cases with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\nhighly dispersive band edges, to a degree that varies with composition.

Real-world knowledge graphs are usually incomplete, so\nknowledge graph embedding methods, such as Canonical decomposition/Parallel\nfactorization (CP), DistMult, and ComplEx, have been proposed to address this\nissue. These methods represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in\nsemantic space and predict the links between them. The embedding vectors\nthemselves contain rich semantic information and can be used in other\napplications such as data analysis. However, mechanisms in these models and the\nembedding vectors themselves vary greatly, making it difficult to understand\nand compare them. Given this lack of understanding, we risk using them\nineffectively or incorrectly, particularly for complicated models, such as CP,\nwith two role-based embedding vectors, or the state-of-the-art ComplEx model,\nwith complex-valued embedding vectors.

In this work, we design a new\nlearning-from-motion paradigm to bridge these gaps. Instead of explicitly\nmodeling the motion probabilities, we design the pretext task as a conditional\nmotion propagation problem. Given an input image and several sparse flow\nguidance vectors on it, our framework seeks to recover the full-image motion.\nCompared to other alternatives, our framework has several appealing properties:\n(1) Using sparse flow guidance during training resolves the inherent motion\nambiguity, and thus easing feature learning.

Experimentally, $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$ is a weak itinerant\nantiferromagnet whereas $3R$-Y$_2$Ni$_7$ is a weak itinerant ferromagnet. From\nthe present first principles calculation within non-spin polarized state, both\ncompounds present an electronic density of state with a sharp and narrow peak\ncentered at the Fermi level corresponding to flat bands from $3d$-Ni. This\ninduces a magnetic instability and both compounds are more stable in a\nferromagnetic (FM) order compared to a paramagnetic state ($\\Delta E \\simeq$\n-35 meV/f.u.). The magnetic moment of each of the five Ni sites varies with\ntheir positions relative to the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] and [$A$Ni$_5$] units: they are\nminimum in the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] unit and maximum at the interface between two\n[$A$Ni$_5$] units. For $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure\nhas been proposed and found with an energy comparable to that of the FM state.\nThis AFM structure is described by two FM unit blocks of opposite Ni spin sign\nseparated by a non-magnetic layer at z = 0 and $\\frac12$. The Ni ($2a$) atoms\nbelonging to this intermediate layer are located in the [La$_2$Ni$_4$] unit and\nare at a center of symmetry of the hexagonal cell ($P6_3/mmc$) where the\nresultant molecular field is cancelled. Further non-collinear spin calculations\nhave been performed to determine the Ni moment orientations which are found\npreferentially parallel to the $c$ axis for both FM and AFM structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 13:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 10:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

For the\ngeneration of multipartite entangled states, the single-step method is more\npreferable as the needed time will not increase with the increasing of the\nqubit number. However, this scenario has a strict requirement that all the\ntwo-qubit interaction strengths should be the same, or the generated state will\nbe of low quality.

Meanwhile, in order to obtain our wanted multi-qubits\ninteraction, x-direction ac classical field for each qubit is also introduced.\nBy selecting the appropriate parameters, we numerically shown that\nhigh-fidelity multi-qubit GHZ states can be generated.

We have equipped\nour method with two different state-of-the-art SR algorithms which\nautomatically search for equations that fit the measured data: Single Node\nGenetic Programming (SNGP) and Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP). In\naddition to the standard problem formulation in the state-space domain, we show\nhow the method can also be applied to input-output models of the NARX\n(nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) type. We present the approach\non three simulated examples with up to 14-dimensional state space: an inverted\npendulum, a mobile robot, and a bipedal walking robot. A comparison with deep\nneural networks and local linear regression shows that SR in most cases\noutperforms these commonly used alternative methods. We demonstrate on a real\npendulum system that the analytic model found enables a RL controller to\nsuccessfully perform the swing-up task, based on a model constructed from only\n100 data samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 15:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 09:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

Here we propose a novel scheme for\nSOT-induced field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization.\nThe proposed scheme can be implemented in a simple magnetic tunnel junction\n(MTJ) /heavy-metal system, without the need of complicated device structure.\nThe perpendicular-anisotropy MTJ is patterned into elliptical shape and\nmisaligned with the axis of the heavy metal, so that the uniaxial shape\nanisotropy aids the magnetization switching. Furthermore, unlike the\nconventional switching scheme where the switched final magnetization state is\ndependent on the direction of the applied current, in our scheme the bipolar\nswitching is implemented by choosing different current paths, which offers a\nnew freedom for developing novel spintronics memories or logic devices. Through\nthe macrospin simulation, we show that a wide operation window of the applied\ncurrent pulse can be obtained in the proposed scheme.

Another advantage\nof the SP3 approximation is a similar structure of equations that is used in\nthe diffusion method. Therefore, there is no difficulty to implement the SP3\nsolution option to the multi-group neutron diffusion codes. In this work, the\napplication of the SP3 methodology based on solution of the {\\lambda}- and\n{\\alpha}-spectral problems has been tested for the IAEA-2D and HWR reactor\nbenchmark tests. The FEM is chosen to achieve the 3D geometrical generality,\nusing GMSH as a generic mesh generator. The results calculated with the\ndiffusion and SP3 methods are compared with the reference transport calculation\nresults. It was found for the HWR reactor test that some eigenvalues are\ncomplex when calculating using both diffusion and SP3 options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

This {\\it ad hoc} assignment of the renormalization scale\ncauses the coefficients of the QCD running coupling at each perturbative order\nto be strongly dependent on the choice of both the renormalization scale and\nthe renormalization scheme. However, such ambiguities are not necessary, since\nas a basic requirement of renormalization group invariance (RGI), any physical\nobservable must be independent of the choice of both the renormalization scheme\nand the renormalization scale. In fact, if one uses the {\\it Principle of\nMaximum Conformality} (PMC) to fix the renormalization scale, the coefficients\nof the pQCD series match the series of conformal theory, and they are thus\nscheme independent. It has been found that the elimination of the scale and\nscheme ambiguities at all orders relies heavily on how precisely we know the\nanalytic form of the QCD running coupling $\\alpha_s$. In this review, we\nsummarize the known properties of the QCD running coupling and its recent\nprogresses, especially for its behavior within the asymptotic region. We also\nsummarize the current progress on the PMC and some of its typical applications,\nshowing to what degree the conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale\nambiguities can be eliminated after applying the PMC. We also compare the PA\napproach for the conventional scale-dependent pQCD series and the PMC\nscale-independent conformal series. We observe that by using the conformal\nseries, the PA approach can provide a more reliable estimate of the magnitude\nof the uncalculated terms. And if the conformal series for an observable has\nbeen calculated up to $n_{\\rm th}$-order level, then the $[N/M]=[0/n-1]$-type\nPA series provides an important estimate for the higher-order terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 12:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 09:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 09:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

Therefore, this paper\nproposes a novel evaluation protocol called Tightness-aware\nIntersect-over-Union (TIoU) metric that could quantify completeness of ground\ntruth, compactness of detection, and tightness of matching degree.\nSpecifically, instead of merely using the IoU value, two common detection\nbehaviors are properly considered; meanwhile, directly using the score of TIoU\nto recognize the tightness.

The accuracy of\nour processing approach on the measurements of bubble size, location and\ninclination is assessed using the synthetic bubble holograms and a 3D printed\nphysical target. The holographic measurement technique is further implemented\nto capture the fluctuation of instantaneous gas leakage rate from a ventilated\nsupercavity generated in a water tunnel experiment. Overall, our paper\nintroduces a low cost, compact and high-resolution bubble measurement technique\nthat can be used for characterizing low void fraction bubbly flow in a broad\nrange of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 15:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

In\nthis context, classical bipartite user-item graphs (BIP) are widely used to\ncompute top-N recommendations. However, these graphs have some limitations,\nparticularly in terms of taking temporal dynamic into account. This is not good\nbecause users' preference change over time. To overcome this limit, the\nSession-based Temporal Graph (STG) was proposed by Xiang et al. to combine\nlong- and short-term preferences in a graph-based recommender system. But in\nthe STG, time is divided into slices and therefore considered discontinuously.\nThis approach loses details of the real temporal dynamics of user actions. To\naddress this challenge, we propose the Link Stream Graph (LSG) which is an\nextension of link stream representation proposed by Latapy et al. and which\nallows to model interactions between users and items by considering time\ncontinuously. Experiments conducted on four real world implicit datasets for\ntemporal recommendation, with 3 evaluation metrics, show that LSG is the best\nin 9 out of 12 cases compared to BIP and STG which are the most used\nstate-of-the-art recommender graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

While many academic papers focus mainly on\nthe legal qualification of DLT and crypto-assets, and most notably in relation\nto the potential definition of the latter as securities/financial instruments,\nthe authors analyze some of the use cases based on DLT technology and their\npotential for significant changes of the corporate governance analyses. This\narticle studies the consequences due to the emergence of new kinds of firm\nstakeholders, i.e. the crypto-assets holders, on the governance of small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (`SMEs') as well as of publicly traded companies.\nSince early 2016, a new way of raising funds has rapidly emerged as a major\nissue for FinTech founders and financial regulators. Frequently referred to as\ninitial coin offerings, Initial Token Offerings (`ITO'), Token Generation\nEvents (`TGE') or simply `token sales', we use in our paper the terminology\nInitial Crypto-asset Offerings (`ICO'), as it describes more effectively than\n`initial coin offerings' the vast diversity of assets that could be created and\nwhich goes far beyond the payment instrument issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

Theoretical models are needed, which capture essential features\nwhile being simple enough to yield insights into mechanisms. In a stylised\nmodel, we study CSIs in a two-level system of weakly interacting communities\nharvesting a common-pool resource. Community members adaptively conform to, or\ndefect from, a norm of socially optimal harvesting, enforced through social\nsanctioning both within and between communities. Each subsystem's dynamics\ndepend sensitively on the other despite interactions being much weaker between\nsubsystems than within them. When interaction is purely biophysical, stably\nhigh cooperation in one community can cause cooperation in the other to\ncollapse. However, even weak social interaction can prevent collapse of\ncooperation and instead cause collapse of defection. We identify conditions\nunder which subsystem-level cooperation produces desirable system-level\noutcomes. Our findings expand evidence that collaboration is important for\nsustainably managing shared resources, showing its importance even when\nresource sharing and social relationships are weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 19:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}
