These higher level functions have been adopted\nin standards conforming runtime systems such as HPX, giving users the ability\nto simply utilize fork-join parallelism in their own codes. Despite innovations\nin runtime systems and standardization efforts users face enormous challenges\nporting legacy applications.

We then carry out a\nconcrete case study, in which we give an algorithmic account of the result that\nin any commutative ring, the intersection of all prime ideals is contained in\nits nilradical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 17:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

This size dependence is being increasingly used to explain diverse\nnon-equilibrium phase selection, and relaxation, as in the random first-order\ntransition (RFOT) theory of glasses. Here we develop an order parameter based\nGinzburg-Landau approach that explicitly includes the rugged free energy\nlandscape due to the metastable phases. The fractional dependence of total\nsurface energy between melt and stable solid phase on the number of metastable\nphases($N_{MS}$) has been interrogated in this study. We have also analyzed how\nthis fractional dependence gets modified with temperature. We find that the\nfractional size dependence of surface energy is omnipresent, arises from the\nminimization of free energy and demands certain ordering of metastable phases\nin the interface. Our results could recover the celebrated result of Villain\nthat forms the basis of RFOT theory of glasses. We find the additional result\nthat the surface tension saturates to a finite size independent value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 17:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

Anticipating such extreme solar\nevents, auroral records were also surveyed in historical documents and those\nincluding the red celestial sign after sunset in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\n(ASC) were subjected to consideration. Usoskin et al. (2013: U13) interpreted\nthis record as an aurora and suggested enhanced solar activity around 774/775.\nConversely, Neuhauser and Neuhauser (2015a, 2015b: N15a and N15b) interpreted\n\"after sunset\" as during sunset or twilight; they considered this sign as a\nhalo display and suggested a solar minimum around 774. However, so far these\nrecords have not been discussed in comparison with eyewitness auroral records\nduring the known extreme space-weather events, although they were discussed in\nrelationship with potential extreme events in 774/775. Therefore, we\nreconstruct the observational details based on the original records in the ASC\nand philological references, compare them with eyewitness auroral observations\nduring known extreme space-weather events, and consider contemporary solar\nactivity. We clarify the observation was indeed \"after sunset\", reject the\nsolar halo hypothesis, define the observational time span between 25 Mar. 775\nand 25 Dec. 777, and note the parallel halo drawing in 806 in the ASC shown in\nN15b was not based on the original observation in England. We show examples of\neyewitness auroral observations during twilight in known space-weather events,\nand this celestial sign does not contradict the observational evidence.\nAccordingly, we consider this event happened after the onset of the event in\n774/775, but shows relatively enhanced solar activity, with other historical\nauroral records in the mid-770s, as also confirmed by the Be data from ice\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 17:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Communication requirements for\nmulti-agent systems can be rather high when an accurate picture of the\nenvironment and the state of other agents must be maintained. To reduce the\nimpact of multi-agent coordination on networked systems, e.g., power and\nbandwidth, this paper introduces two concepts for partially observable Markov\ndecision processes (POMDPs): 1) action-based constraints which yield\nconstrained-action POMDPs (CA-POMDPs); and 2) soft probabilistic constraint\nsatisfaction for the resulting infinite-horizon controllers. To enable\nconstraint analysis over an infinite horizon, an unconstrained policy is first\nrepresented as a Finite State Controller (FSC) and optimized with policy\niteration. The FSC representation then allows for a combination of Markov chain\nMonte Carlo and discrete optimization to improve the probabilistic constraint\nsatisfaction of the controller while minimizing the impact to the value\nfunction. Within the CA-POMDP framework we then propose Intelligent Knowledge\nDistribution (IKD) which yields per-agent policies for distributing knowledge\nbetween agents subject to interaction constraints. Finally, the CA-POMDP and\nIKD concepts are validated using an asset tracking problem where multiple\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with heterogeneous sensors collaborate to\nlocalize a ground asset to assist in avoiding unseen obstacles in a disaster\narea. The IKD model was able to maintain asset tracking through multi-agent\ncommunications while only violating soft power and bandwidth constraints 3% of\nthe time, while greedy and naive approaches violated constraints more than 60%\nof the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 18:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

In this paper, we carry out a\nsystematic statistical study of quadruple BHs consisting of two binaries in\norbit around their center of mass, by means of high-precision direct $N$-body\nsimulations including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to 2.5PN order.

A minimal EBL throughout the\nwavelength range with respect to integrated galaxy light is found, allowing\nlittle additional unresolved emission from faint or truly diffuse populations\nsetting an upper limit of $\\lesssim 4~{\\rm nW\\cdot m^{-2}sr^{-1}}$ at 1.4 ${\\rm\n\\mu m}$. In particular, the cosmic optical background (COB) at $z=0$ is found\nto be $27.8_{-2.0}^{+2.1}~{\\rm nW\\cdot m^{-2}sr^{-1}}$. This work lays the\nfoundation for accurate gamma-ray measurements of the EBL across its whole\nspectral range using a combination of GeV and TeV data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 19:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 19:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Spy Hunter, a continuous\nauthentication mechanism uses keystroke dynamics to validate users over blocks\nof data. This easily-incorporated periodic biometric authentication system\nvalidates genuine users and detects intruders quickly. Because it verifies\nusers in the background, Spy Hunter is not constrained to a password box.\nInstead, it is flexible and can be layered with other mechanisms to provide\nhigh-level security. Where other continuous authentication techniques rely on\nscripted typing, Spy Hunter validates over free text in authentic environments.\nThis is accomplished in two phases, one where the user is provided a prompt and\nanother where the user is allowed free access to their computer. Additionally,\nSpy Hunter focuses on the timing of different keystrokes rather than the\nspecific key being pressed. This allows for anonymous data to authenticate\nusers and avoids holding personal data. Utilizing a couple K-fold\ncross-validation techniques, Spy Hunter is assessed based on how often the\nsystem falsely accepts an intruder, how often the system falsely rejects a\ngenuine user, and the time it takes to validate a users identity. Spy Hunter\nmaintains error rates below 6% and identifies users in minimal numbers of\nkeystrokes.

In this paper, we provide an\noverview of methods that assume that MRI Fourier data is linearly predictable.\nLinear prediction is well known in signal processing and may be most\nrecognizable for its usefulness in speech processing and spectrum estimation\napplications. In MRI, linear predictability implies that data can be sampled\nbelow the conventional Nyquist rate, since unmeasured data may be imputed as a\nshift-invariant linear combination of measured samples. Linear predictive\nmethods include some of the earliest methods in the computational MRI\nreconstruction field, some of the most widely utilized computational MRI\nmethods in modern clinical practice, and some of the most flexible and\nversatile modern computational imaging approaches that are enabling\nunprecedented new styles of data acquisition. In addition, the concept of\nlinear predictability can be used to unify a number of more classical MRI\nreconstruction constraints, but without needing to make the strong assumptions\nof classical constrained reconstruction methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 19:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 19:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Animal tracking using wireless sensors is one such application of\nWSN where power management plays a vital role. In this paper, an\nenergy-efficient hybrid routing method is proposed that divides the whole\nnetwork into smaller regions based on sensor location and chooses the routing\nscheme accordingly. The sensor network consists of a base station (BS) located\nat a distant place outside the network, and a relay node is placed inside the\nnetwork for direct communications from nodes nearer to it. The nodes are\nfurther divided into two categories based on the supplied energy; such that the\nones located far away from BS and relay have higher energy than the nodes\nnearer to them.

Thanks to\nsocial learning, users have richer information about the state beyond their\nprivate signals. Based on both her private signal and learned group signals,\neach user makes strategic decisions to report a privacy-preserved version of\nher data to the data collector. We develop a Bayesian game theoretic framework\nto study the impact of social learning on users' data reporting strategies and\ndevise the payment mechanism for the data collector accordingly. Our findings\nreveal that, in general, the desired data reporting strategy at the\nBayesian-Nash equilibrium can be in the form of either a symmetric randomized\nresponse (SR) strategy or an informative non-disclosive (ND) strategy.\nSpecifically, a generalized majority voting rule is applied by each user to her\nnoisy group signals to determine which strategy to follow. Further, when a user\nplays the ND strategy, she reports privacy-preserving data completely based on\nher group signals, independent of her private signal, which indicates that her\nprivacy cost is zero. We emphasize that the reported data when a user plays the\nND strategy is still informative about the underlying state because it is based\non her learned group signals. As a result, both the data collector and the\nusers can benefit from social learning which drives down the privacy costs and\nhelps to improve the state estimation at a given payment budget.

Much of the appeal comes from the fact that\nAtari games demonstrate aspects of competency we expect from an intelligent\nagent and are not biased toward any particular solution approach. The challenge\nof the ALE includes (1) the representation learning problem of extracting\npertinent information from raw pixels, and (2) the behavioural learning problem\nof leveraging complex, delayed associations between actions and rewards. Often,\nthe research questions we are interested in pertain more to the latter, but the\nrepresentation learning problem adds significant computational expense. We\nintroduce MinAtar, short for miniature Atari, a new set of environments that\ncapture the general mechanics of specific Atari games while simplifying the\nrepresentational complexity to focus more on the behavioural challenges.\nMinAtar consists of analogues of five Atari games: Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix,\nFreeway and Space Invaders. Each MinAtar environment provides the agent with a\n10x10xn binary state representation. Each game plays out on a 10x10 grid with n\nchannels corresponding to game-specific objects, such as ball, paddle and brick\nin the game Breakout. To investigate the behavioural challenges posed by\nMinAtar, we evaluated a smaller version of the DQN architecture as well as\nonline actor-critic with eligibility traces. With the representation learning\nproblem simplified, we can perform experiments with significantly less\ncomputational expense. In our experiments, we use the saved compute time to\nperform step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE.\nExperiments like this improve reproducibility, and allow us to draw more\nconfident conclusions. We hope that MinAtar can allow researchers to thoroughly\ninvestigate behavioural challenges similar to those inherent in the ALE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 20:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 00:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

(2) Recent measurements of the\nthermal and dynamic properties in high-mass star-forming regions reveal small\nvirial parameters, challenging the assumption of equilibrium star formation.\nHowever, we estimate that a magnetic field strength of a fraction of a mG to\nseveral mG in these objects could bring the dense gas close to a state of\nequilibrium.

In these scenarios, the robot should maintain the\nbest viewpoint as it moves to the goal. However, in unstructured or confined\nenvironments, some paths may increase the risk of collision; therefore there is\na tradeoff between risk and reward. Conventional state-dependent risk or\nprobabilistic uncertainty modeling do not consider path-level risk or is\ndifficult to acquire. This risk-reward planner explicitly represents risk as a\nfunction of motion plans, i.e., paths. Without manual assignment of the\nnegative impact to the planner caused by risk, this planner takes in a\npre-established viewpoint quality map and plans target location and path\nleading to it simultaneously, in order to maximize overall reward along the\nentire path while minimizing risk. Exact and approximate algorithms are\npresented, whose solution is further demonstrated on a physical tethered aerial\nvehicle.

We argue that the Milky Way disk within 10 kpc has been enriched to\nsolar metallicity by a massive stellar population: the thick disk, which itself\nformed from a massive turbulent gaseous disk. The key new consideration is that\nthe pre-enrichment provided by the thick disk is not related to the mass\nfraction of this stellar population at the solar radius, as is classically\nassumed in inside-out scenarios, but is actually related to the formation of\nthe entire massive thick disk, due to the vigorous gas phase mixing that\noccurred during its formation. Hence, the fact that this population represents\nonly 15-25% of the local stellar surface density today is irrelevant for\n`solving' the G-dwarf problem. The only condition for this scenario to work is\nthat the thick disk was formed from a turbulent gaseous disk that permitted a\nhomogeneous -- not radially dependent -- distribution of metals, allowing the\nsolar ring to be enriched to solar metallicity. At the solar radius, the gas\nflowing from the outer disk combined with the solar metallicity gas left over\nfrom thick disk formation, providing the fuel necessary to form the thin disk\nat the correct metallicity to solve the G-dwarf problem. Chemical evolution at\nR$>$6 kpc, and in particular beyond the solar radius, can be reproduced with\nthe same scheme.

These escape\ntimes and radii, when used as initial conditions for the CR propagation outside\nthe source, result in relevant suppression of the diffusion coefficient (by a\nfactor 5-10) on time-scales comparable with their (energy dependent) escape\ntime-scale. The damping mechanisms are fast enough that even on shorter time\nscales the Alfv\\'enic turbulence is efficiently damped, and the ratio between\nrandom and ordered component of the magnetic field is $\\delta B/B_0\\ll 1$,\njustifying the use of quasi-linear theory. In spite of the suppressed diffusion\ncoefficient, and then the increased residence time in the vicinity (<200 pc) of\ntheir source, the grammage accumulated by CRs after their escape is found to be\nnegligible (at all energies) as compared to the one accumulated while diffusing\nin the whole Galaxy, due to the low density of the HIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 21:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Using a first-principles,\nnon-equilibrium simulation approach based on real-time time-dependent density\nfunctional theory, we determine the electronic stopping power, the\nvelocity-dependent energy transfer rate from irradiating ions to electrons. The\nelectronic stopping power curve agrees quantitatively over the entire velocity\nrange for which experimental data is available. Also notably, we observe\nsignificant differences between our first-principles results and commonly-used\nperturbation theoretic models. Excitations of the water molecules' oxygen core\nelectrons are a crucial factor in determining the electronic stopping power\ncurve beyond its maximum. The core electron contribution is responsible for as\nmuch as one-third of the stopping power at the high proton velocity of 8.0 a.u.\n(1.6 MeV). These K-shell core electron excitations not only provide an\nadditional channel for the energy transfer but they also significantly\ninfluence the valence electron excitation. In the excitation process, generated\nholes remain highly localized within a few angstroms around the irradiating\nproton path whereas electrons are excited away from the path. In spite of its\ngreat contribution to the electronic stopping power, the K-shell electrons play\na rather minor role in terms of the excitation density: Only one percent of the\nhole population comprises K-shell holes, even at the high proton velocity of\n8.0 a.u.. The excitation behavior revealed here is distinctly different from\nthat of X/gamma-ray photon radiation, which is the most commonly used type of\nionizing radiation in radiation oncology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 21:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 16:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Recent work on Ivy shows that FOL is well suited for verification\nof parameterized distributed systems.

We present a\nframework based on FOL for specifying distributed multi-process protocols in a\nprocess-local manner together with an implicit network topology. In the\nspecification framework, we provide an auto-active analysis technique to reason\nabout the protocols locally, in a process-modular way. Our goal is to mirror\nthe way designers often describe and reason about protocols. By hiding the\ntopology behind the FOL structure, we simplify the modelling, but complicate\nthe reasoning. To deal with that, we use an oracle for the topology to develop\na sound and relatively complete proof rule that reduces reasoning about the\nimplicit topology back to pure FOL. This completely avoids the need to\naxiomatize the topology. Using the rule, we establish a property that reduces\nverification to a fixed number of processes bounded by the size of local\nneighbourhoods.

A popular approach to\nmultichannel source separation is to integrate a spatial model with a source\nmodel for estimating the spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) and power spectral\ndensities (PSDs) of each sound source in the time-frequency domain. One of the\nmost successful examples of this approach is multichannel nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (MNMF) based on a full-rank spatial model and a low-rank source\nmodel. MNMF, however, is computationally expensive and often works poorly due\nto the difficulty of estimating the unconstrained full-rank SCMs. Instead of\nrestricting the SCMs to rank-1 matrices with the severe loss of the spatial\nmodeling ability as in independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), we\nrestrict the SCMs of each frequency bin to jointly-diagonalizable but still\nfull-rank matrices. For such a fast version of MNMF, we propose a\ncomputationally-efficient and convergence-guaranteed algorithm that is similar\nin form to that of ILRMA. Similarly, we propose a fast version of a\nstate-of-the-art speech enhancement method based on a deep speech model and a\nlow-rank noise model.

To improve this, ranking-motivated structured losses are\nproposed recently to incorporate multiple examples and exploit the structured\ninformation among them. They converge faster and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. In this work, we unveil two limitations of existing\nranking-motivated structured losses and propose a novel ranked list loss to\nsolve both of them. First, given a query, only a fraction of data points is\nincorporated to build the similarity structure. Consequently, some useful\nexamples are ignored and the structure is less informative. To address this, we\npropose to build a set-based similarity structure by exploiting all instances\nin the gallery. The learning setting can be interpreted as few-shot retrieval:\ngiven a mini-batch, every example is iteratively used as a query, and the rest\nones compose the gallery to search, i.e., the support set in few-shot setting.\nThe rest examples are split into a positive set and a negative set. For every\nmini-batch, the learning objective of ranked list loss is to make the query\ncloser to the positive set than to the negative set by a margin. Second,\nprevious methods aim to pull positive pairs as close as possible in the\nembedding space. As a result, the intraclass data distribution tends to be\nextremely compressed. In contrast, we propose to learn a hypersphere for each\nclass in order to preserve useful similarity structure inside it, which\nfunctions as regularisation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof our proposal by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 01:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 17:10:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 20:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 11:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 12:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 12:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 23:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 10:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

The\nordering is modeled as antiferromagnetic spin stripes that are commensurate\nwith the charge stripes, the magnetic ordering occurring in individual\ntrilayers that are essentially uncorrelated along the crystallographic c-axis.\nComparison of the charge and spin stripe order parameters reveals that, in\ncontrast to single-layer nickelates such as La2-xSrxNiO4 as well as related\nquasi-2D oxides including manganites, cobaltates, and cuprates, these orders\nuniquely appear simultaneously, thus demonstrating a stronger coupling between\nspin and charge than in these related low-dimensional correlated oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 01:51:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 13:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

In this paper, we present a compiler for\nthe Scaffold quantum programming language in which aggressive optimization\nspecifically targets NISQ machines with hundreds of qubits. Our compiler\nextracts gates from a Scaffold program, and formulates a constrained\noptimization problem which considers both program characteristics and machine\nconstraints. Using the Z3 SMT solver, the compiler maps program qubits to\nhardware qubits, schedules gates, and inserts CNOT routing operations while\noptimizing the overall execution time. The output of the optimization is used\nto produce target code in the OpenQASM language, which can be executed on\nexisting quantum hardware such as the 16-qubit IBM machine. Using real and\nsynthetic benchmarks, we show that it is feasible to synthesize near-optimal\ncompiled code for current and small NISQ systems.

Confusion for a learner is an individual state of bewilderment and\nuncertainty of how to move forward. The majority of recent works neglect the\n'individual' factor and measure the influence of community-related aspects\n(e.g. votes, views) for confusion classification. While this is a useful\nmeasure, as the popularity of one's post can indicate that many other students\nhave similar confusion regarding course topics, these models neglect the\npersonalised context, such as individual's affect or emotions. Certain\nphysiological aspects (e.g. facial expressions, heart rate) have been utilised\nto classify confusion in small to medium classrooms. However, these techniques\nare challenging to adopt to MOOCs. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach\nsolely based on language and discourse aspects of learners, which outperforms\nthe previous models.

In the pre-edge region the behaviour of the A1-A3 and B peaks,\noriginating from the 1s-3d transitions, is due to the strong $p$-orbital\npolarization and strong $p-d$ orbital mixing. An unambiguous assignment of the\npre-edge peak transitions is made in the monoelectronic approximation with the\nsupport of ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor\nanalysis in quantitative agreement with the experiment. It is found that A1 is\nmostly an on-site 3d-4p hybridized transition, while peaks A3 and B are\nnon-local transitions, with A3 being mostly dipolar and influence by the 3d-4p\nintersite hybridization, while B is due to interactions at longer range.\nFinally, peak A2 which was previously assigned to a transition involving\npentacoordinated titanium atoms exhibits a quadrupolar angular evolution with\nincidence angle.

In this paper we address these shortcomings\nwith a novel \"multi-sensor\" fusion approach applied to multiple image\nprocessing methods for a single visual image stream, combined with a dynamic\nsequence matching length technique and an automatic processing method weighting\nscheme. In contrast to conventional single method approaches, our approach\nreduces the performance requirements of a single image processing methodology,\ninstead requiring that within the suite of image processing methods, at least\none performs well in any particular environment. In comparison to static\nsequence length techniques, the dynamic sequence matching technique enables\nreduced localization latencies through analysis of recognition quality metrics\nwhen re-entering familiar locations. We evaluate our approach on multiple\nchallenging benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance to two\nstate-of-the-art visual place recognition systems across environmental changes\nincluding winter to summer, afternoon to morning and night to day.

A sudden shortening of the half-lives of Ni isotopes beyond $N=50$\nwas observed at the RIKEN-RIBF. This is considered due to the persistence of\nthe neutron magic number $N=50$ in the very neutron-rich Ni isotopes. By\nsystematically studying the $\\beta$-decay rates and strength distributions in\nthe neutron-rich Ni isotopes around $N=50$, I try to understand the microscopic\nmechanism for the observed sudden shortening of the half-lives. The\n$\\beta$-strength distributions in the neutron-rich nuclei are described in the\nframework of nuclear density-functional theory. I employ the Skyrme\nenergy-density functionals (EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for\nthe ground states and in the proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random-Phase\nApproximation (pnQRPA) for the transitions. Not only the allowed but the\nfirst-forbidden (FF) transitions are considered. The experimentally observed\nsudden shortening of the half-lives beyond $N=50$ is reproduced well by the\ncalculations employing the Skyrme SkM* and SLy4 functionals. The sudden\nshortening of the half-lives is due to the shell gap at $N=50$ and\ncooperatively with the high-energy transitions to the low-lying $0^-$ and $1^-$\nstates in the daughter nuclei. The onset of FF transitions pointed out around\n$N=82$ and 126 is preserved in the lower-mass nuclei around $N=50$.

In contrast with counting rules and\n'curly-arrow' descriptions of destructive QI, magic number theory captures the\nmany forms of constructive QI, which can occur in molecular cores.

In this\npaper, we propose the mutual bootstrapping deep convolutional neural networks\n(MB-DCNN) model for simultaneous skin lesion segmentation and classification.\nThis model consists of a coarse segmentation network (coarse-SN), a mask-guided\nclassification network (mask-CN), and an enhanced segmentation network\n(enhanced-SN). On one hand, the coarse-SN generates coarse lesion masks that\nprovide a prior bootstrapping for mask-CN to help it locate and classify skin\nlesions accurately. On the other hand, the lesion localization maps produced by\nmask-CN are then fed into enhanced-SN, aiming to transfer the localization\ninformation learned by mask-CN to enhanced-SN for accurate lesion segmentation.\nIn this way, both segmentation and classification networks mutually transfer\nknowledge between each other and facilitate each other in a bootstrapping way.\nMeanwhile, we also design a novel rank loss and jointly use it with the Dice\nloss in segmentation networks to address the issues caused by class imbalance\nand hard-easy pixel imbalance. We evaluate the proposed MB-DCNN model on the\nISIC-2017 and PH2 datasets, and achieve a Jaccard index of 80.4% and 89.4% in\nskin lesion segmentation and an average AUC of 93.8% and 97.7% in skin lesion\nclassification, which are superior to the performance of representative\nstate-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation and classification methods.

While several machines\nhave been developed to automate one or two steps in the sanding works, the\nautonomous capability of existing solutions is relatively low, and the human\nassistance or supervision is still heavily required in the calibration of\ntarget objects or the planning of robot motion and tasks. This paper presents\nthe development of an autonomous sanding robot, which is able to perform the\nsanding works on an unknown object automatically, without any prior calibration\nor human intervention. The developed robot works as follows. First, the target\nobject is scanned then modeled with the structured-light camera. Second, the\nrobot motion is planned to cover all the surfaces of the object with an\noptimized transition sequence. Third, the robot is controlled to perform the\nsanding on the object under the desired impedance model. A prototype of the\nsanding robot is fabricated and its performance is validated in the task of\nsanding a batch of wooden boxes. With sufficient degrees of freedom (DOFs) and\nthe module design for the end effector, the developed robot is able to provide\na general solution to the autonomous sanding on many other different objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 08:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

In previous one-bit MIMO precoding\nresearch, one mainly focuses on using optimization to tackle the difficult\nbinary signal optimization problem that arises from the precoding design. Our\napproach attempts a different route. Assuming angular MIMO channels, we apply\n$\\Sigma\\Delta$ modulation---a classical concept in analog-to-digital conversion\nof temporal signals---in space. The resulting $\\Sigma\\Delta$ precoding approach\nhas two main advantages: First, we no longer need to deal with binary\noptimization in $\\Sigma\\Delta$ precoding design. Particularly, the binary\nsignal restriction is replaced by peak signal amplitude constraints. Second,\nthe impact of the quantization error can be well controlled via modulator\ndesign and under appropriate operating conditions. Through symbol error\nprobability analysis, we reveal that the very large number of antennas in\nmassive MIMO provides favorable operating conditions for $\\Sigma\\Delta$\nprecoding. In addition, we develop a new $\\Sigma\\Delta$ modulation architecture\nthat is capable of adapting the channel to achieve nearly zero quantization\nerror for a targeted user.

We argue that sub-optimal and ill-informed design decisions\nand choices of blockchain components and their configurations including smart\ncontracts, key management, cryptographic and consensus mechanisms, on-chain vs.\noff chain storage choices can introduce security technical debt into the\nsystem.

The reliable and early\ndifferentiation between healthy and diseased cells is the main aim of this\nstudy in order to improve the quality of the treatment and to understand tumour\npathogenesis. Here, the optical stretcher is used to analyse mechanical\nproperties of cells and their potential to serve as a marker for malignancy.\nStretching experiments revealed for the first time that cells of primary OSCCs\nwere deformed by 2.9 % rendering them softer than cells of healthy mucosa which\nwere deformed only by 1.9 %. Furthermore, the relaxation behaviour of the cells\nrevealed that these malignant cells exhibit a faster contraction than their\nbenign counterparts. This suggests that deformability as well as relaxation\nbehaviour can be used as distinct parameters to evaluate emerging differences\nbetween these benign and malignant cells. Since many studies in cancer research\nare performed with cancer cell lines rather than primary cells, we have\ncompared the deformability and relaxation of both types, showing that long time\nculturing leads to softening of cells. The higher degree of deformability and\nrelaxation behaviour can enable cancer cells to traverse tissue emphasizing\nthat changes in cell architecture may be a potential precondition for malignant\ntransformation. Respecting the fact that even short culture times have an\nessential effect on the significance of the results, the use of primary cells\nfor further research is recommended. The distinction between malignant and\nbenign cells would enable an early confirmation of cancer diagnoses by testing\ncell samples of suspect oral lesions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 08:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

First, for $C^1$ solutions of the 1-dimensional\nclassical isentropic compressible Euler equations in the Eulerian setting, we\nshow a novel idea of obtaining a mass density time-dependent lower bound by\nstudying the difference of the two Riemann invariants, along with certain\nweighted gradients of them. Furthermore, using an elaborate argument on a\ncertain ODE inequality and introducing some key artificial (new) quantities, we\napply this idea to obtain the lower bound estimate for the mass-energy density\nof the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler equations. Ultimately, for $C^1$\nsolutions with uniformly positive initial mass-energy density of the\n(1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler equations, we give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the formation of singularity in finite time, which\ngives a complete picture for the ($C^1$) large data problem in dimension\n$(1+1)$.

A Moving Least\nSquares (MLS) scheme has been implemented to correlate the pressure, velocity\nand force fields of the fluid domain with the capsule dynamics.

Secondly, this strategy\nis directly compared with a more conventional approach, named LBM Kinematic IB,\nwhere capsules move with the same velocity of the surrounding fluid.

Depending on the experiment setup,\nthis residual moment may cause significant signal bias and image artifacts. The\npurpose of this study was to develop an asymmetric gradient waveform design for\ntensor-valued diffusion encoding that is not affected by concomitant gradient.\nMethods: The Maxwell index was proposed as a scalar invariant that captures the\neffect of concomitant gradients and was constrained in the numerical\noptimization to 100 (mT/m)$^2$ms to yield Maxwell-compensated waveforms. The\nefficacy of this design was tested in an oil phantom, and in a healthy human\nbrain. For reference, waveforms from literature were included in the analysis.\nSimulations were performed to investigate if the design was valid for a wide\nrange of experiments and if it could predict the signal bias. Results:\nMaxwell-compensated waveforms showed no signal bias in oil or in the brain. By\ncontrast, several waveforms from literature showed gross signal bias. In the\nbrain, the bias was large enough to markedly affect both signal and parameter\nmaps, and the bias could be accurately predicted by theory. Conclusion:\nConstraining the Maxwell index in the optimization of asymmetric gradient\nwaveforms yields efficient tensor-valued encoding with concomitant gradients\nthat have a negligible effect on the signal. This waveform design is especially\nrelevant in combination with strong gradients, long encoding times, thick\nslices, simultaneous multi-slice acquisition and large/oblique FOVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 10:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

We add two leptoquarks and their L-R duals,\nfor generating the baryon number asymmetry and for facilitating the decay of\nthe L-R dual particles. The decay of the L-R dual particles will produce a\nlarge entropy to the SM sector and gives a mechanism for avoiding the big bang\nnucleosynthesis constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 11:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 09:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Since the work of\nGoldreich and Ostrovsky, it was believed that there is an inherent $\n\\Omega(\\log n) $ bandwidth overhead in any ORAM working with memory of size $ n\n$.

We give an $\\Omega(\\log n)\n$ lower bound for the bandwidth overhead of any online ORAM even when the\nadversary has no access to this information.

This SVM is used to estimate the degree of\nabnormality of each region which is then used to obtain subject-specific\ndisease progression patterns. These patterns are in turn used for estimating\nthe mean ordering by fitting a generalized Mallows model. In order to validate\nthe biomarker ordering obtained using nDEBM, we also present a framework for\nSimulation of Imaging Biomarkers' Temporal Evolution (SImBioTE) that mimics\nneurodegeneration in brain regions. SImBioTE trains variational auto-encoders\n(VAE) in different brain regions independently to simulate images at varying\nstages of disease progression. We also validate nDEBM clinically using data\nfrom the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In both\nexperiments, nDEBM using high-dimensional features gave better performance than\nstate-of-the-art EBM methods using regional volume biomarkers. This suggests\nthat nDEBM is a promising approach for disease progression modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 12:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

By considering the validation question of a computer\ncode as a Bayesian selection model problem, Damblin et al.

In this paper, we investigate\nthe issue of code error identifiability by applying another Bayesian model\nselection technique which has been recently developed by Kamary et al. (2014).\nBy embedding the competing models within an encompassing mixture model, Kamary\net al. (2014)'s method allows each observation to belong to a different mixing\ncomponent, providing a more flexible inference, while remaining competitive in\nterms of computational cost with the intrinsic Bayesian approach. By using the\ntechnique of sharing parameters mentioned in Kamary et al.

We then check\nthe sensitivity of our posterior estimates to the choice of the parameter prior\ndistributions. We illustrate that the value of the correlation length of the\ndiscrepancy Gaussian process prior impacts the Bayesian inference of the\nmixture model parameters and that the model discrepancy can be identified by\napplying the Kamary et al.

Recent research has shown that machine learning\nalgorithms can be used to address the inverse problem of converting pixel-wise\nmultispectral reflectance measurements to underlying tissue parameters, such as\noxygenation. Assessment of the specific hardware used in conjunction with such\nalgorithms, however, has not properly addressed the possibility that the\nproblem may be ill-posed.\n  Methods: We present a novel approach to the assessment of optical imaging\nmodalities, which is sensitive to the different types of uncertainties that may\noccur when inferring tissue parameters. Based on the concept of invertible\nneural networks, our framework goes beyond point estimates and maps each\nmultispectral measurement to a full posterior probability distribution which is\ncapable of representing ambiguity in the solution via multiple modes.\nPerformance metrics for a hardware setup can then be computed from the\ncharacteristics of the posteriors.\n  Results: Application of the assessment framework to the specific use case of\ncamera selection for physiological parameter estimation yields the following\ninsights: (1) Estimation of tissue oxygenation from multispectral images is a\nwell-posed problem, while (2) blood volume fraction may not be recovered\nwithout ambiguity. (3) In general, ambiguity may be reduced by increasing the\nnumber of spectral bands in the camera.\n  Conclusion: Our method could help to optimize optical camera design in an\napplication-specific manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 13:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

We attribute the\nnonuniformity to the symmetry mismatch at the interface, which induces a\nstructural distortion related to the ferroelasticity of LCO.

Running\nDNNs on resource-constrained mobile devices often requires the help from edge\nservers via computation offloading. However, offloading through a\nbandwidth-limited wireless link is non-trivial due to the tight interplay\nbetween the computation resources on mobile devices and wireless resources.\nExisting studies have focused on cooperative inference where DNN models are\npartitioned at different neural network layers, and the two parts are executed\nat the mobile device and the edge server, respectively. Since the output data\nsize of a DNN layer can be larger than that of the raw data, offloading\nintermediate data between layers can suffer from high transmission latency\nunder limited wireless bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an efficient and\nflexible 2-step pruning framework for DNN partition between mobile devices and\nedge servers. In our framework, the DNN model only needs to be pruned once in\nthe training phase where unimportant convolutional filters are removed\niteratively. By limiting the pruning region, our framework can greatly reduce\neither the wireless transmission workload of the device or the total\ncomputation workload. A series of pruned models are generated in the training\nphase, from which the framework can automatically select to satisfy varying\nlatency and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, coding for the intermediate\ndata is added to provide extra transmission workload reduction. Our experiments\nshow that the proposed framework can achieve up to 25.6$\\times$ reduction on\ntransmission workload, 6.01$\\times$ acceleration on total computation and\n4.81$\\times$ reduction on end-to-end latency as compared to partitioning the\noriginal DNN model without pruning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 14:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

This article presents a\nframework to simulate the transport and deposition of heavy particles over\ncomplex surfaces using the large eddy simulation (LES) technique. An immersed\nboundary LES code is coupled with an Eulerian particle code that solves the\nadvection-diffusion equation for the resolved particle concentration field. The\nmass conservation equation for the particle phase is discretized in a finite\nvolume framework using a Cartesian cut cell method that reshapes finite volume\ncells intersected by the immersed boundary surface and conserves mass\naccurately. The proposed numerical model is compared with data from wind tunnel\nexperiments of heavy particle deposition over topography and is found to have\ngood agreement with observed deposition patterns. An LES case study of snow\ndeposition over idealized topography leads to several new insights. Particle\ninertia leads to relative velocities between the particles and fluid in regions\nof mean flow acceleration, thereby enhancing deposition on the windward side of\nobstacles and suppressing deposition on the leeward side. In addition, it is\nfound that the mean components of particle inertia are a factor of 6 or more\nlarger than the turbulent components, indicating that the\nenhancement/suppression of deposition by topography can be modeled in terms of\nmean flow quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 15:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

To overcome this issue,\na non intrusive reduced real coded genetic algorithm (RGA) for near real time\noptimal control is designed. This algorithm uses precalculated parametrized\nsolution snapshots stored in the POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) reduced\nform, to predict the solution snapshots for chromosomes over generations.

Fluid in these networks is usually natural gas for\ndistribution in the municipalities, water in waterworks or hot water in\ndistrict heating system, air in the case of ventilation systems in buildings or\nmines, etc. Since, the resistances in these networks depend of flow, problem is\nnot linear like in electrical circuits, and iterative procedure must be used.\nIn both version of the Hardy Cross method, in original and in the improved one,\ninitial results of calculation in iteration procedure is not flow, but rather\nthe correction of flow. Unfortunately, these corrections should be added to or\nsubtracted from a flow calculated in previous iteration according to complicate\nalgebraic rules. After the here presented node-loop method, final results in\neach of the iterations is flow directly rather than flow correction. In that\nway complex algebraic scheme for sign of flow correction is avoided, while the\nfinal results still remain unchanged. Numbers of required iterations for the\nsame results are comparable with the improved Hardy Cross method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 08:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Yet, only a small percentage of\npatients could benefit from this life-saving treatment because of medical\ncontraindications and severe side effects, including brain hemorrhage,\nassociated with delayed administration. Here, a nano therapeutic agent is\nrealized by directly associating the clinical formulation of tPA to the porous\nstructure of soft discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs (tPA-DPNs). The porous\nmatrix of DPNs protects tPA from rapid degradation, allowing tPA-DPNs to\npreserve over 70 % of the tPA original activity after 3 h of exposure to serum\nproteins. Under dynamic conditions, tPA-DPNs dissolve clots more efficiently\nthan free tPA, as demonstrated in a microfluidic chip where clots are formed\nmimicking in vivo conditions. At 60 min post treatment initiation, the clot\narea reduces by half (57 + 8 %) with tPA-DPNs, whereas a similar result (56 +\n21 %) is obtained only after 90 min for free tPA. In murine mesentery venules,\nthe intravenous administration of 2.5 mg/kg of tPA-DPNs resolves almost 90 % of\nthe blood clots, whereas a similar dose of free tPA successfully recanalize\nonly about 40 % of the treated vessels. At about 1/10 of the clinical dose (1.0\nmg/kg), tPA-DPNs still effectively dissolve 70 % of the clots, whereas free tPA\nworks efficiently only on 16 % of the vessels. In vivo, discoidal tPA-DPNs\noutperform the lytic activity of 200 nm spherical tPA-coated nanoconstructs in\nterms of both percentage of successful recanalization events and clot area\nreduction. The conjugation of tPA with preserved lytic activity, the\ndeformability and blood circulating time of DPNs together with the faster blood\nclot dissolution would make tPA-DPNs a promising nanotool for enhancing both\npotency and safety of thrombolytic therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 11:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}
