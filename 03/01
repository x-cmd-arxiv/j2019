Rather than directly\nmeasuring the broadening of spectral lines, we leverage the large information\ncontent of high-resolution spectral data to empirically estimate $v\\sin{i}$. We\nadapt the framework laid down by The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015), which trains a\ngenerative model of the stellar flux as a function of wavelength using\nhigh-fidelity reference data, and can then produce estimates of stellar\nparameters and abundances for other stars directly from their spectra. Instead\nof modeling the flux as a function of wavelength, however, we model the first\nderivative of the spectra, as we expect the slopes of spectral lines to change\nas a function of $v\\sin{i}$. This technique is computationally efficient and\nprovides a means of rapidly estimating $v\\sin{i}~$ for large numbers of stars\nin spectroscopic survey data. We analyze SDSS APOGEE spectra, constructing a\nmodel informed by high-fidelity stellar parameter estimates derived from\nhigh-resolution California Kepler Survey spectra of the same stars.

By extension, a graph is colourful if\nall its connected components are colourful. Given a vertex-coloured graph $G$\nand an integer $p$, the Colourful Components problem asks whether there exist\nat most $p$ edges whose removal makes $G$ colourful and the Colourful Partition\nproblem asks whether there exists a partition of $G$ into at most $p$ colourful\ncomponents. In order to refine our understanding of the complexity of the\nproblems on trees, we study both problems on $k$-caterpillars, which are trees\nwith a central path $P$ such that every vertex not in $P$ is within distance\n$k$ from a vertex in $P$. We prove that Colourful Components and Colourful\nPartition are NP-complete on $4$-caterpillars with maximum degree $3$,\n$3$-caterpillars with maximum degree $4$ and $2$-caterpillars with maximum\ndegree $5$. On the other hand, we show that the problems are linear-time\nsolvable on $1$-caterpillars. Hence, our results imply two complexity\ndichotomies on trees: Colourful Components and Colourful Partition are\nlinear-time solvable on trees with maximum degree $d$ if $d \\leq 2$ (that is,\non paths), and NP-complete otherwise; Colourful Components and Colourful\nPartition are linear-time solvable on $k$-caterpillars if $k \\leq 1$, and\nNP-complete otherwise. We leave three open cases which, if solved, would\nprovide a complexity dichotomy for both problems on $k$-caterpillars, for every\nnon-negative integer $k$, with respect to the maximum degree.

For estimation of\nabsolute permeability based on micro-tomographic images of the porous medium,\nthe single-relaxation time (SRT) collision model is the most widely-used,\nalthough the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision model also has recently\nacquired wider usage, especially for industrial applications. However, the SRT\ncollision model and a sub-optimal choice of the MRT collision parameters can\nboth lead to permeability predictions that depend on the relaxation time, \\tau.\nThis parametric dependence is nonphysical for Stokes flow in porous media and\nalso leads to much larger number of iterations required for convergence.

Our main result is that the\ntemperature features on II Peg closely correlate with its magnetic field\ntopology. We find a warm spot (350K warmer with respect to the effective\ntemperature) of positive polarity and radial field density of 1.1 kG coexisting\nwith a cool spot (780K cooler) of negative polarity of 2 kG. Several other cool\nfeatures are reconstructed containing both polarities and with (radial) field\ndensities of up to 2 kG. The largest cool spot is reconstructed with a\ntemperature contrast of 550 K, an area of almost 10% of the visible hemisphere,\nand with a multipolar magnetic morphology. A meridional and an azimuthal\ncomponent of the field of up to +/-500G is detected in two surface regions\nbetween spots with strong radial fields but different polarities. A force-free\nmagnetic-field extrapolation suggests that the different polarities of cool\nspots and the positive polarity of warm spots are physically related through a\nsystem of coronal loops of typical height of approx. 2 Rstar. While the H-alpha\nline core and its red-side wing exhibit variations throughout all rotational\nphases, a major increase of blue-shifted H-alpha emission was seen for the\nphases when the warm spot is approaching the stellar central meridian\nindicating high-velocity mass motion within its loop. We explain the warm spots\ndue to photospheric heating by a shock front from a siphon-type flow between\nregions of different polarities while the majority of the cool spots is likely\nformed due to the expected convective suppression like on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 16:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Models with MDLSTM layers have achieved\nstate-of-the art results on handwritten text recognition tasks. While\nmulti-directional MDLSTM-layers have an unbeaten ability to capture the\ncomplete context in all directions, this strength limits the possibilities for\nparallelization, and therefore comes at a high computational cost. In this work\nwe develop methods to create efficient MDLSTM-based models for NHR,\nparticularly a method aimed at eliminating computation waste that results from\npadding. This proposed method, called example-packing, replaces wasteful\nstacking of padded examples with efficient tiling in a 2-dimensional grid. For\nword-based NHR this yields a speed improvement of factor 6.6 over an already\nefficient baseline of minimal padding for each batch separately. For line-based\nNHR the savings are more modest, but still significant. In addition to\nexample-packing, we propose: 1) a technique to optimize parallelization for\ndynamic graph definition frameworks including PyTorch, using convolutions with\ngrouping, 2) a method for parallelization across GPUs for variable-length\nexample batches. All our techniques are thoroughly tested on our own PyTorch\nre-implementation of MDLSTM-based NHR models. A thorough evaluation on the IAM\ndataset shows that our models are performing similar to earlier implementations\nof state-of-the-art models.

To set the scene, we first discuss the collider\nphenomenology of the six possible electroweakino benchmark scenarios, as they\nprovide valuable insight into what one might be facing at the LHC. We review\nthe existing methods for mass reconstruction from measured kinematic endpoints\nin the distributions of suitable variables, e.g., the invariant masses of\nvarious sets of visible decay products, as well as the $M_{T2}$ and the $M_2$\ntypes of variables. We propose to extend the application of these methods to\nthe various topologies of fully hadronic final states, possibly with\nhadronically reconstructed massive bosons (W, Z or h). We test the idea with a\nsimplified simulation of events in the main electroweakino benchmark scenarios.\nWe find that the fully hadronic events allow the complete determination of the\nrelevant mass spectrum. For comparison, we also review the potential of the\nstandard kinematic endpoint methods for final states involving leptons from the\ndecays of (on-shell or off-shell) sleptons. We find that with 300 $fb^{-1}$,\nthe statistics for the leptonic events is very marginal and they look less\npromising than the fully hadronic channels. This corresponds to a complete\nreversal of the usual paradigm, where leptonic events comprised the gold-plated\nSUSY channels. Finally, we put together all available information and summarize\nwhat level of understanding of the underlying physics can be achieved. We show\nthat, as a by-product of the mass reconstruction, it is also possible to\ndetermine the production cross sections and decay branching ratios, which in\nturn enable us to pinpoint the underlying model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 18:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

All the access points (APs) in the network cooperate to jointly\nand coherently serve a smaller number of users in the same time-frequency\nresource. However, this coordination needs significant amounts of control\nsignalling which introduces additional overhead, while data co-processing\nincreases the back/front-haul requirements. Hence, the notion that the \"whole\nworld\" could constitute one network, and that all APs would act as a single\nbase station, is not scalable. In this study, we address some system\nscalability aspects of cell-free massive MIMO that have been neglected in\nliterature until now.

Here, by combining chemical and hydrostatic\nphysical pressure in FeSe$_{0.89}$S$_{0.11}$, we provide a unique access to a\nclean nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of a long-range magnetic\norder. We find that in the proximity of the nematic phase transition, there is\nan unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior in resistivity at high temperatures that\nevolves into a Fermi liquid behaviour at the lowest temperatures. From quantum\noscillations in high magnetic fields, we trace the evolution of the Fermi\nsurface and electronic correlations as a function of applied pressure. We\ndetect experimentally a Lifshitz transition that separates two distinct\nsuperconducting regions: one emerging from the nematic electronic phase with a\nsmall Fermi surface and strong electronic correlations and the other one with a\nlarge Fermi surface and weak correlations that promotes nesting and\nstabilization of a magnetically-ordered phase at high pressures. The lack of\nmass divergence suggests that the nematic critical fluctuations are quenched by\nthe strong coupling to the lattice. This establishes that superconductivity is\nnot enhanced at the nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of magnetic\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 18:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

In this paper, we\nleverage existing theory of reachability analysis and risk measures to devise a\nrisk-sensitive reachability approach for safety of stochastic dynamic systems\nunder non-adversarial disturbances over a finite time horizon. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce the notion of a risk-sensitive safe set as a set of initial\nstates from which the risk of large constraint violations can be reduced to a\nrequired level via a control policy, where risk is quantified using the\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure. Second, we show how the computation\nof a risk-sensitive safe set can be reduced to the solution to a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), where cost is assessed according to CVaR. Third,\nleveraging this reduction, we devise a tractable algorithm to approximate a\nrisk-sensitive safe set, and provide theoretical arguments about its\ncorrectness. Finally, we present a realistic example inspired from stormwater\ncatchment design to demonstrate the utility of risk-sensitive reachability\nanalysis.

Hence, SDN can\nsupport a wide range of middleware services; network performance monitoring is\nan example of these services that are already deployed in practice. In this\npaper, we exploit the use of SDNs to efficiently provide application monitoring\nfunctionality. The recent rise of complex cloud applications has made\nperformance monitoring a major issue. We show that many performance indicators\ncan be inferred from messages exchanged among application components. By\nanalyzing these messages, we argue that the overhead of performance monitoring\ncould be effectively moved from the end hosts into the SDN middleware of the\ncloud infrastructure which enables more flexible placement of logging\nfunctionality. This paper explores several approaches for supporting\napplication monitoring through SDN. In particular, we combine selective\nforwarding in SDN to enable message filtering and reformatting, and propose a\ncustomized port sniffing technique. We describe the implementation of the\napproach within the standard SDN software, namely OVS. We further provide a\ncomprehensive performance evaluation to analyze advantages and disadvantages of\nour approach, and highlight the trade-offs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 18:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Little can be predicted about\nthe systems' evolution without modeling the guard conditions that govern\ntransitions between hybrid modes, so even systems with reliable state sensing\ncan be difficult to control. We propose an algorithm that allows for\ndetermining the hybrid mode of a system in real-time using data-driven\nanalysis. The algorithm is used with data-driven dynamics identification to\nenable model predictive control based entirely on data. Two examples---a\nsimulated hopper and experimental data from a bipedal walker---are used. In the\ncontext of the first example, we are able to closely approximate the dynamics\nof a hybrid SLIP model and then successfully use them for control in\nsimulation. In the second example, we demonstrate gait partitioning of human\nwalking data, accurately differentiating between stance and swing, as well as\nselected subphases of swing. We identify contact events, such as heel strike\nand toe-off, without a contact sensor using only kinematics data from the knee\nand hip joints, which could be particularly useful in providing online\nassistance during walking. Our algorithm does not assume a predefined gait\nstructure or gait phase transitions, lending itself to segmentation of both\nhealthy and pathological gaits.

The objective of our method is to identify\nthe low dimensional linear projections of two random vectors, such that any\ndimension reduction based on linear projection with lower dimensions will\nsurely affect some dependent structure -- the removed components are not\nindependent. The essence of DISCA is to use the distance correlation to\neliminate the \"redundant\" dimensions until infeasible. Unlike the existing\ncanonical analysis methods, DISCA does not require the dimensions of the\nreduced subspaces of the two random vectors to be equal, nor does it require\ncertain distributional assumption on the random vectors. We show that under\nmild conditions, our approach does undercover the lowest possible linear\ndependency structures between two random vectors, and our conditions are weaker\nthan some sufficient linear subspace-based methods. Numerically, DISCA is to\nsolve a non-convex optimization problem. We formulate it as a\ndifference-of-convex (DC) optimization problem, and then further adopt the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) on the convex step of the DC\nalgorithms to parallelize/accelerate the computation. Some sufficient linear\nsubspace-based methods use potentially numerically-intensive bootstrap method\nto determine the dimensions of the reduced subspaces in advance; our method\navoids this complexity.

In particular, we apply both\nparametric and nonparametric models and compare the two different fitting\nmethods. We also use these methods to compare the results of the M dwarf M-R\nrelationship with that from the Kepler sample. Using the nonparametric method,\nwe find that the predicted masses for the smallest and largest planets around M\ndwarfs are smaller than that given by the relation fit to the Kepler data, but\nthat the distribution of masses for 3 Earth Radii planets does not\nsubstantially differ between the two datasets.

It is\nconsidered that the degradation and shock process are mutually dependent. In\nfact, each arriving shock accelerates the degradation process by adding abrupt\nadditional damages to the degradation path and changing the degradation rate\naccording to specific magnitude; also, the cumulative degradation changes the\noccurrence intensity of shock process. A gamma process is used as a stochastic\nprocess to model the degradation path.

Most industrial\nrobot motion controllers allow externally commanded motion profile, but the\ntrajectory tracking performance is affected by the robot dynamics and joint\nservo controllers which users have no direct access and little information. The\nperformance is further compromised by time delays in transmitting the external\ncommand as a setpoint to the inner control loop. This paper presents an\napproach of combining neural networks and iterative learning control to improve\nthe trajectory tracking performance for a multi-axis articulated industrial\nrobot. For a given desired trajectory, the external command is iteratively\nrefined using a high fidelity dynamical simulator to compensate for the robot\ninner loop dynamics. These desired trajectories and the corresponding refined\ninput trajectories are then used to train multi-layer neural networks to\nemulate the dynamical inverse of the nonlinear inner loop dynamics. We show\nthat with a sufficiently rich training set, the trained neural networks can\ngeneralize well to trajectories beyond the training set. In applying the\ntrained neural networks to the physical robot, the tracking performance still\nimproves but not as much as in the simulator. We show that transfer learning\ncan effectively bridge the gap between simulation and the physical robot. In\nthe end, we test the trained neural networks on other robot models in\nsimulation and demonstrate the possibility of a general purpose network.\nDevelopment and evaluation of this methodology is based on the ABB IRB6640-180\nindustrial robot and ABB RobotStudio software packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:57:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 23:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Methods: In May 2011, ten male volunteers (age\nrange: 29 to 53 years, mean: 37 years) underwent DW-MRI of the upper abdomen on\n1.5T and 3.0T magnetic resonance scanners. Regions of interest in the left and\nright liver lobe, pancreas, spleen, renal cortex, and renal medulla were\ndelineated independently by two readers. DNNs were trained for IVIM model\nfitting using these data; results were compared to least-squares and Bayesian\napproaches to IVIM fitting.

Because the signal generation process relies on quantum mechanical\nprinciples, the system is considered to contain a quantum-enhanced radar\ntransmitter. This transmitter generates a pair of entangled microwave signals\nand transmits one of them through free space, where the signal is measured\nusing a simple and rudimentary receiver.\n  At the heart of the transmitter is a device called a Josephson parametric\namplifier (JPA), which generates a pair of entangled signals called two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum (TMSV) at 6.1445 GHz and 7.5376 GHz. These are then sent\nthrough a chain of amplifiers. The 7.5376 GHz beam passes through 0.5 m of free\nspace; the 6.1445 GHz signal is measured directly after amplification. The two\nmeasurement results are correlated in order to distinguish signal from noise.\n  We compare our QTMS radar to a classical radar setup using conventional\ncomponents, which we call a two-mode noise radar (TMN radar), and find that\nthere is a significant gain when both systems broadcast signals at -82 dBm.\nThis is shown via a comparison of receiver operator characteristic (ROC)\ncurves.

The server has an availability state that\nindicates, at each instant, whether the server is busy working on a task or is\navailable. In the latter case, if the queue is nonempty, then a task-assignment\ncontrol policy implemented by the scheduler either assigns a new task to the\nserver or allows it to rest. The server also has an integer-valued activity\nstate that is non-increasing during rest periods, and is non-decreasing\notherwise. An instantaneous service rate function ascribes to each possible\nvalue of the activity state a probability that the server can complete a task\nin one time step. For a typical instantaneous service rate function, the\ncompletion probability decreases (server performance worsens) as the activity\nstate increases. The scheduler policy has access to the queue size and the\nentire state of the server.\n  In this article, we study the problem of designing scheduler policies that\nstabilize the queue.

Previous studies that\nmodeled planetary formation that is dominated by photo-evaporation predicted\nthis bimodal radii distribution and the presence of a radius gap, or\nphoto-evaporation valley. Our results are in overall agreement with these\nmodels. The high internal precision achieved here in the derived planetary\nradii clearly reveal the presence of a slope in the photo-evaporation valley\nfor the CKS sample, indicating that the position of the radius gap decreases\nwith orbital period; this decrease was fit by a power law of the form R$_{pl}$\n$\\propto$ P$^{-0.11}$, which is consistent with photo-evaporation and\nEarth-like core composition models of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 06:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

This conclusion contradicts the widely accepted belief that\nthe divergence of the Floquet-Magnus expansion is a direct consequence of\nquantum ergodicity, which implies that each eigenstate of the time evolution\noperator is a linear combination of all available eigenstates of the\nunperturbed Hamiltonian and the system heats up to infinite temperature after\nlong intervals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 08:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 03:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

In this article we probe the interfacial anchoring of a series of\nhome-made hydrophobically modified polymers of controlled degree of grafting by\nstudying their behavior upon large area dilations and compressions. By\ncomparing the measured interfacial tension to the one that we expect in the\ncase of a constant number of adsorbed monomers, we are able to deduce whether\ndesorption or adsorption occurs during area variations. We find that the\npolymer chains with the longest hydrophobic grafts desorb for larger\ncompressions than the polymers with the shortest grafts, because of their\nlarger desorption energy. Furthermore, we observe more desorption for polymers\nwith the highest grafting densities. We attribute this counter intuitive result\nto the fact that for high grafting densities, the length of the polymer loops\nis shorter, hence the elastic penalty upon compression is larger for these\nlayers, leading to a faster desorption. The dilatation experiments reveal that\nthe number of adsorbed anchors remains constant in the case of chains with low\ngrafting density while chains with the highest degree of grafting seem to show\nsome degree of adsorption during the dilatation. Therefore for these highly\ngrafted chains there may be unadsorbed grafts remaining in the vicinity of the\ninterface, which may adsorb quickly to the interface upon dilatation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 09:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

Such queries consider a regular expression r and a directed\nedge-labeled graph G and search for paths in G for which the sequence of labels\nis in the language of r.

A common\nbelief on the semismooth Newton method is its fast convergence rate as well as\nhigh computational complexity. Our contribution in this paper is that by\nexploring the sparse structure of the models, we significantly reduce the\ncomputational complexity, meanwhile keeping the quadratic convergence rate.\nExtensive numerical experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the\nsemismooth Newton method, especially for problems with huge size of sample data\n(for news20.binary problem with 19996 features and 1355191 samples, it only\ntakes three seconds).

For most existing\nlearning to hash methods, sufficient training images are required and used to\nlearn precise hashing codes. However, in some real-world applications, there\nare not always sufficient training images in the domain of interest. In\naddition, some existing supervised approaches need a amount of labeled data,\nwhich is an expensive process in term of time, label and human expertise. To\nhandle such problems, inspired by transfer learning, we propose a simple yet\neffective unsupervised hashing method named Optimal Projection Guided Transfer\nHashing (GTH) where we borrow the images of other different but related domain\ni.e., source domain to help learn precise hashing codes for the domain of\ninterest i.e., target domain. Besides, we propose to seek for the maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) solution of the hashing functions of target and\nsource domains due to the domain gap. Furthermore,an alternating optimization\nmethod is adopted to obtain the two projections of target and source domains\nsuch that the domain hashing disparity is reduced gradually.

To test\nthis assertion, we systematically evaluated visual crowding, a dramatic\nbreakdown of recognition in clutter, in DCNNs and compared their performance to\nextant research in humans. We examined crowding in three architectures of DCNNs\nwith the same methodology as that used among humans. We manipulated multiple\nstimulus factors including inter-letter spacing, letter colour, size, and\nflanker location to assess the extent and shape of crowding in DCNNs. We found\nthat crowding followed a predictable pattern across architectures that was\ndifferent from that in humans. Some characteristic hallmarks of human crowding,\nsuch as invariance to size, the effect of target-flanker similarity, and\nconfusions between target and flanker identities, were completely missing,\nminimised or even reversed. These data show that DCNNs, while proficient in\nobject recognition, likely achieve this competence through a set of mechanisms\nthat are distinct from those in humans.

To this effect, we first regularize the Euclidean and Lorentzian parts\nof the Hamiltonian constraint separately in the case of a Bianchi I cosmology.\nThis allows us to identify a natural symmetrization of the Hamiltonian which is\napparent in anisotropic scenarios.

Interestingly, in the context of massive MIMO\nsystems, channels exhibit a large degree of spatial correlation which results\nin strongly rank-deficient spatial covariance matrices at the base station\n(BS). With the final objective of analyzing the benefits of covariance-aided\nuplink multi-user CSI acquisition in massive MIMO systems, here we compare the\nchannel estimation mean-square error (MSE) for (i) conventional CSI\nacquisition, which does not assume any knowledge on the user spatial covariance\nmatrices and uses orthogonal pilot sequences; and (ii) covariance-aided CSI\nacquisition, which exploits the individual covariance matrices for channel\nestimation and enables the use of non-orthogonal pilot sequences. We apply a\nlarge-system analysis to the latter case, for which new asymptotic MSE\nexpressions are established under various assumptions on the distributions of\nthe pilot sequences and on the covariance matrices. We link these expressions\nto those describing the estimation MSE of conventional CSI acquisition with\northogonal pilot sequences of some equivalent length.

The standard WiFi association method makes the STAs select the AP\nwith the strongest signal, which in many cases leads to underutilization of\nsome APs while overcrowding others. To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement\nLearning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically\nlearn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs\namong the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem\nsince the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of\nthe others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the\nnetwork. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized\nway, where STAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage\nrange, and select the one that better satisfy its needs. To do it, we propose a\nnovel approach called Opportunistic {\\epsilon}-greedy with Stickiness that\nhalts the exploration when a suitable AP is found, then, it remains associated\nto it while the STA is satisfied, only resuming the exploration after several\nunsatisfactory association periods. With this approach, we reduce significantly\nthe network response variability, improving the ability of the STAs to find a\nsolution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the network\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 13:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

Resting state fMRI data is widely used for inferring\nconnectivities in the brain which are not due to external factors.

In this\npaper, we model fMRI data as functional time series and develop tools for the\ndetection of deviations from covariance stationarity via change point\nalternatives. We propose a nonparametric procedure which is based on dimension\nreduction techniques. However, as the projection of the functional time series\non a finite and rather low-dimensional subspace involves the risk of missing\nchanges which are orthogonal to the projection space, we also consider two test\nstatistics which take the full functional structure into account.

We\npresent here the first experimental evidence for the presence of the\ncharacteristic superlattice reflections due to an AFD transition at a moderate\npressure pc1 ~2.15 GPa in broad agreement with scenario (2), but the high\npressure ferroelectric phase belongs to the monoclinic space group Cc, and not\nthe tetragonal space group I4cm predicted under scenario (2), which permits the\nrotation of the ferroelectric polarization vector as per scenario (1). We show\nthat the monoclinic distortion angle and ferroelectric polarization of the Cc\nphase initially decrease with increasing pressure for p < 7 GPa, but start\nincreasing above pc2 ~ 7 GPa due to an isostructural Cc-I to Cc-II transition\nreminiscent of MA(apc > bpc ~ cpc) to MB(apc< bpc ~ cpc) transition predicted\nfor MPB systems. We also show that octahedral tilting provides an efficient\nmechanism for accommodating pressure induced volume reduction for the\nstabilisation of the reentrant ferroelectric phase Cc-II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 14:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

By combining active and passive rheology experiments, performed on the\nsame micro-bead bound to the actin network through membrane adhesive receptors,\nwe measure the auto-correlation function Cff(t) of the average force pulling on\nthe bead. Like for any out-of-equilibrium system, the force distribution\ndiffers from the thermodynamical equilibrium one, especially at long time scale\nt>1sec where the bead motion becomes partially directed. Thus the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem does not apply and one can measure the distance\nfrom equilibrium through its violation. This work focuses on the influence of\nvarious parameters (ligand density, temperature, ATP depletion, molecular\nmotors activity) on the force distribution. In particular, it is shown that the\namplitude of active forces increases when the bead is more tighly attached to\nthe cortex: this is interpreted through a model which takes into account the\nnumber of bonds between the bead and the cytoskeleton and the viscoelastic\nproperties of the medium. It also increases with temperature, consistently with\na description of the cell metabolism in terms of thermally activated reactions.\nLast, but not least, ATP depletion in the cell, or partial inhibitition of the\nactomyosin activity, leads to a decrease of the amplitude of the force\ndistribution. Altogether, we propose a consistent and quantitative description\nfor the motion of a micrometric probe interacting with the actin network, and\nfor the amplitude of the stochastic forces generated by molecular motors in the\ncortex surrounding this probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 15:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

By comparing the photospheric abundances\nderived from multiple ionization states of C, N, O, Si, and S, we infer an\neffective temperature T_eff = 21,400 +/- 400 K. Balmer-line fits yield a\nsurface gravity log g = 3.10 +/- 0.03. We derive photospheric abundances of He,\nC, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ge. Barnard 29 exhibits\nan abundance pattern typical of the first-generation stars in M13, enhanced in\noxygen and depleted in aluminum. An underabundance of C and an overabundance of\nN suggest that the star experienced nonconvective mixing on the RGB. We see no\nevidence of significant chemical evolution since the star left the RGB; in\nparticular, it did not undergo third dredge-up. Previous workers found that the\nstar's FUV spectra yield an iron abundance about 0.5 dex lower than its optical\nspectrum, but the iron abundances derived from all of our spectra are\nconsistent with the cluster value. We attribute this difference to our use of\nmodel atmospheres without microturbulence, which is ruled out by careful fits\nto optical absorption features. We derive a mass M_*/M_sun = 0.45 - 0.55 and\nluminosity log (L_*/L_sun) = 3.26 - 3.35.

In the present article we test a\nnovel $f(R,T)$ gravity model within the physics and geometry of wormholes. The\n$f(R,T)$ gravity is a reputed alternative gravity theory in which the Ricci\nscalar $R$ in the Einstein-Hilbert gravitational lagrangian is replaced by a\ngeneral function of $R$ and $T$, namely $f(R,T)$, with $T$ representing the\ntrace of the energy-momentum tensor. We propose, for the first time in the\nliterature, an exponential form for the dependence of the theory on $T$. We\nderive the field equations as well as the non-continuity equation and solve\nthose to wormhole metric and energy-momentum tensor. The importance of applying\nalternative gravity to wormholes is that through these theories it might be\npossible to obtain wormhole solutions satisfying the energy conditions,\ndeparting from General Relativity well-known outcomes.

This work presents a method to model egocentric bias, the\nreal-life tendency to emphasize one's own opinion heavily when presented with\nmultiple opinions. We use a symmetric distribution centered at an agent's own\nopinion, as opposed to the Bounded Confidence (BC) model used in prior work. We\nconsider a game of iterated interactions where an agent cooperates based on its\nopinion about an opponent. Our model also includes the concept of domain-based\nself-doubt, which varies as the interaction succeeds or not. An increase in\ndoubt makes an agent reduce its egocentricity in subsequent interactions, thus\nenabling the agent to learn reactively. The agent system is modeled with\nfactions not having a single leader, to overcome some of the issues associated\nwith leader-follower factions. We find that agents belonging to factions\nperform better than individual agents. We observe that an intermediate level of\negocentricity helps the agent perform at its best, which concurs with\nconventional wisdom that neither overconfidence nor low self-esteem brings\nbenefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 12:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

Clean ablated structures\nare generated in such a multi pulse irradiation configuration at low pulse\nenergies as an attractive alternative to ablation with single femtosecond, high\nenergy pulses. For a fully ablated graphene hole, a radially symmetric region\nextending around 2 um from the ablated edge is characterized by strong defect\ngeneration.
