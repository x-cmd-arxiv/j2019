Ground based\nmid-infrared (IR) interferometry is one way of securing the spatial resolution\nrequired to study massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and as the\nspatial-frequency coverage of such observations is often incomplete,\ndirect-imaging can be supplementary to such a dataset. By consolidating these\nobservations with modelling, the features of a massive protostellar environment\ncan be constrained. This work simultaneously fits the aforementioned\nobservations and a spectral energy distribution (SED) with a 2.5D radiative\ntransfer model, providing an extensive view of the physical characteristics of\nthe accreting regions of the MYSO G305.20+0.21. The high-resolution\nobservations were obtained using the Very Large Telescope's MIDI and VISIR\ninstruments, producing visibilities in the N-band and near-diffraction-limited\nimaging in the Q-band respectively. A model including a central protostar with\na luminosity of $\\sim$5$\\times$10$^{4}$L$_{\\odot}$ surrounded by a low-density\nbipolar cavity, a flared 1M$_{\\odot}$ disk and an envelope provides a\nsufficient fit all three types of observation. The need to include a disk in\nthe model implies that this MYSO follows a scaled-up version of the low-mass\nstar formation process. The weak silicate absorption feature within the SED\nrequires low-density envelope cavities to be successfully fit and is an\natypical characteristic in comparison to previously studied MYSOs.\nAdditionally, the inner radius of the disk must be three times the dust\nsublimation radius to satisfy the MIDI visibilities. The low density, low\nextinction environment implies the object is a more evolved MYSO and this\ncombined with large inner radius of the disk suggests that it could be an\nexample of a transitional disk around an MYSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 16:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

In most\napplications, the model parameters may be described by physical properties\n(e.g., wave speeds, density, attenuation, anisotropic parameters) which are\npiecewise functions of space. Compound regularizations are thus necessary to\nreconstruct properly such parameters by FWI. We consider different\nimplementations of compound regularizations in the wavefield reconstruction\ninversion (WRI) method, a formulation of FWI that extends its search space and\nprevent the so-called cycle skipping pathology. Our hybrid regularizations rely\non Tikhonov and total variation (TV) functionals, from which we build two\nclasses of hybrid regularizers: the first class is simply obtained by a convex\ncombination (CC) of the two functionals, while the second relies on their\ninfimal convolution (IC). In the former class, the model of parameters is\nrequired to simultaneously satisfy different priors, while in the latter the\nmodel is broken into its basic components, each satisfying a distinct prior\n(e.g. smooth, piecewise constant, piecewise linear). We implement these types\nof compound regularizations in the WRI optimization problem using the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then, we assess our\nregularized WRI in the framework of seismic imaging applications. Using a wide\nrange of subsurface models, we conclude that compound regularizer based on IC\nleads to the lowest error in the parameter reconstruction compared to that\nobtained with the CC counterpart and the Tikhonov and TV regularizers when used\nindependently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 16:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Additionally, we highlight\ntheoretical work and experimental/observational facilities that will complement\nLSST to strengthen our understanding of the fundamental characteristics of dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 16:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Such\ncharacterizations have led to extortionists, equalizers, partners, and rivals.\nMost of those studies use memory-one strategies, which specify the\nprobabilities to take actions depending on the outcome of the previous round.\nHere, we consider \"reactive learning strategies,\" which gradually modify their\npropensity to take certain actions based on past actions of the opponent. Every\nlinear reactive learning strategy, $\\mathbf{p}^{\\ast}$, corresponds to a memory\none-strategy, $\\mathbf{p}$, and vice versa. We prove that for evaluating the\nregion of feasible payoffs against a memory-one strategy,\n$\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, we need to check its performance against\nat most $11$ other strategies. Thus, $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)$ is\nthe convex hull in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of at most $11$ points.

Success in the multimessenger era requires: (i) sensitive\ncoverage of the non-electromagnetic messengers, (ii) full coverage of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, with either fast-response observations or broad and\ndeep high-cadence surveys, and (iii) improved collaboration, communication, and\nnotification platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

This material variety is matched by the\nrange of relevant stresses and strain rates, from laminar to turbulent flows,\nand steady to intermittent forcing, leading to anything from rapid and\ncatastrophic landslides to the slow relaxation of soil and rocks over geologic\ntimescales. Geophysical flows sculpt landscapes, but also threaten human lives\nand infrastructure. From a physics point of view, virtually all Earth and\nplanetary landscapes are composed of soft matter, in the sense they are both\ndeformable and sensitive to collective effects. Geophysical materials, however,\noften involve compositions and flow geometries that have not yet been examined\nin physics. In this review we explore how a soft-matter perspective has helped\nto illuminate, and even predict, the rich dynamics of Earth materials and their\nassociated landscapes. We also highlight some novel phenomena of geophysical\nflows that challenge, and will hopefully inspire, more fundamental work in soft\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

The messages that are\ndetermined to be communicated are classified into public, private and\nconfidential based on the information they convey. The public message contains\ninformation intended for both parties and is required to be decoded correctly\nby both of them, the private message is intended for the primary party only,\nhowever, there is no secrecy requirement imposed upon it meaning that it can\npossibly be exposed to the third party and finally the confidential message\ncontaining information intended exclusively for the primary party such that\nthis information must be kept completely secret from the other receiver. A\ntrade-off arises between the rates of the three messages, when one of the rates\nis high, the other rates may need to be reduced to guarantee the reliable\ntransmission of all three messages. The encoder performs the necessary\nequivocation by virtue of dummy random numbers whose rate is assumed to be\nlimited and should be considered in the trade-off as well. We study this\ntrade-off in the one-shot regime of a quantum broadcast channel by providing\nachievability and (weak) converse regions. In the achievability, we prove and\nuse a conditional version of the convex-split lemma as well as position-based\ndecoding. By studying the asymptotic behaviour of our bounds, we will recover\nseveral well-known asymptotic results in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

In conjunction with the\nresults obtained in the first part [Daddi-Moussa-Ider, L\\\"{o}wen, and Gekle,\nEur. Phys. J. E 41, 104 (2018)], in which the axisymmetric motion normal to the\nsurface of an elastic cavity is investigated, the general motion for an\narbitrary force direction can be addressed. The elastohydrodynamic problem is\nformulated and solved using the classic method of images through expressing the\nhydrodynamic flow fields as a multipole expansion involving higher-order\nderivatives of the free-space Green's function. In the quasi-steady limit, we\ndemonstrate that the particle self-mobility function of a particle moving\ntangent to the surface of the cavity is larger than that predicted inside a\nrigid stationary cavity of equal size. This difference is justified by the fact\nthat a stationary rigid cavity introduces additional hindrance to the\ntranslational motion of the encapsulated particle, resulting in a reduction of\nits hydrodynamic mobility. Furthermore, the motion of the cavity is\ninvestigated, revealing that the translational pair (composite) mobility, which\nlinearly couples the velocity of the elastic cavity to the force exerted on the\nsolid particle, is solely determined by membrane shear properties. Our\nanalytical predictions are favorably compared with fully-resolved computer\nsimulations based on a completed-double-layer boundary integral method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:40:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 12:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

We obtained their surface photometry\nfrom deep OmegaCAM@ESO-VST images in g and r bands. For NGC 1533, we map the\nsurface brightness down to $\\mu_g \\simeq 30.11$ mag/arcsec$^{2}$ and $\\mu_r\n\\simeq 28.87$ mag/arcsec$^{2}$ and out to about $4R_e$. At such faint levels\nthe structure of NGC 1533 appear amazingly disturbed with clear structural\nasymmetry between inner and outer isophotes in the North-East direction. We\ndetect new spiral arm-like tails in the outskirts, which might likely be the\nsignature of a past interaction/merging event. Similarly, IC 2038 and IC 2039\nshow tails and distortions indicative of their ongoing interaction. Taking\nadvantages of deep images, we are able to detect the optical counterpart to the\nHI gas. The analysis of the new deep data suggests that NGC 1533 had a complex\nhistory made of several interactions with low-mass satellites that generated\nthe star-forming spiral-like structure in the inner regions and are shaping the\nstellar envelope. In addition, the VST observations show that also the two less\nluminous galaxies, IC 2038 and IC 2039, are probably interacting each-other\nand, in the past, IC 2038 could have also interacted with NGC 1533, which\nstripped away gas and stars from its outskirts. The new picture emerging from\nthis study is of an interacting triplet, where the brightest galaxy NGC 1533\nhas ongoing mass assembly in the outskirts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

In this paper, we propose a novel mechanical system\ninspired microscopic traffic model using a mass-spring-damper-clutch system.\nThis model naturally captures the ego vehicle's resistance to large relative\nspeed and deviation from a (driver and speed dependent) desired relative\ndistance when following the lead vehicle. Comparing to existing car following\n(CF) models, this model offers physically interpretable insights on the\nunderlying CF dynamics, and is able to characterize the impact of the ego\nvehicle on the lead vehicle, which is neglected in existing CF models. Thanks\nto the nonlinear wave propagation analysis techniques for mechanical systems,\nthe proposed model therefore has great scalability so that multiple\nmass-spring-damper-clutch system can be chained to study the macroscopic\ntraffic flow. We investigate the stability of the proposed model on the system\nparameters and the time delay using spectral element method. We also develop a\nparallel recursive least square with inverse QR decomposition (PRLS-IQR)\nalgorithm to identify the model parameters online. These real-time estimated\nparameters can be used to predict the driving trajectory that can be\nincorporated in advanced vehicle longitudinal control systems for improved\nsafety and fuel efficiency. The PRLS-IQR is computationally efficient and\nnumerically stable so it is suitable for online implementation. The traffic\nmodel and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on both\nsimulations and naturalistic driving data from multiple drivers.

We show that the emission from\nthe ground state transition is observed in PL but the ER is dominated by\ntransitions between excited states. This effect results from the\npolarization-induced built-in electric field in QW that breaks the selection\nrules that apply to square-like QWs, allowing many optical transitions which\ncannot be separately distinguished in the ER spectrum. We develop the\nguidelines for the identification of optical transitions observed in PL and ER\nspectra. We conclude that an intrinsic Stokes shift, i.e., a shift between\nemission and absorption, is present even for homogeneous GaN/AlGaN QWs with\nlarge width, where the electron-hole wavefunction overlap for the fundamental\ntransition is weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

Motivated by this necessity, we develop a resource theory for magic\nquantum channels to characterize and quantify the quantum \"magic\" or\nnon-stabilizerness of noisy quantum circuits. For qudit quantum computing with\nodd dimension $d$, it is known that quantum states with non-negative Wigner\nfunction can be efficiently simulated classically. First, inspired by this\nobservation, we introduce a resource theory based on completely\npositive-Wigner-preserving quantum operations as free operations, and we show\nthat they can be efficiently simulated via a classical algorithm. Second, we\nintroduce two efficiently computable magic measures for quantum channels,\ncalled the mana and thauma of a quantum channel. As applications, we show that\nthese measures not only provide fundamental limits on the distillable magic of\nquantum channels, but they also lead to lower bounds for the task of\nsynthesizing non-Clifford gates. Third, we propose a classical algorithm for\nsimulating noisy quantum circuits, whose sample complexity can be quantified by\nthe mana of a quantum channel. We further show that this algorithm can\noutperform another approach for simulating noisy quantum circuits, based on\nchannel robustness. Finally, we explore the threshold of non-stabilizerness for\nbasic quantum circuits under depolarizing noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 09:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

The main and most\nwidespread chemical signature is the anti-correlation of the stellar Na and O\nabundances. The interquartile range (IQR) of the [O/Na] ratio is well suited to\nquantifying the extent of the anti-correlation and to probe its links to global\ncluster parameters. However, since it is quite time consuming to obtain precise\nabundances from spectroscopy for large samples of stars in GCs, here we show\nempirical calibrations of IQR[O/Na] based on the O, Na abundances homogeneously\nderived from more than 2000 red giants in 22 GCs in our FLAMES survey. We find\na statistically robust bivariate correlation of IQR as a function of the total\nluminosity (a proxy for mass) and cluster concentration c. Calibrated and\nobserved values lie along the identity line when a term accounting for the\nhorizontal branch (HB) morphology is added to the calibration, from which we\nobtained empirical values for 95 GCs. Spreads in proton-capture elements O and\nNa are found for all GCs in the luminosity range from Mv=-3.76 to Mv=-9.98.\nThis calibration reproduces in a self-consistent picture the link of abundance\nvariations in light elements with the He enhancements and its effect on the\nstellar distribution on the HB. We show that the spreads in light elements seem\nalready to be dependent on the initial GC masses. The dependence of IQR on\nstructural parameters stems from the well known correlation between c and Mv,\nwhich is likely to be of primordial origin. Empirical estimates can be used to\nextend our investigation of multiple stellar populations to GCs in external\ngalaxies, up to M31, where even integrated light spectroscopy may currently\nprovide only a hint of such a phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Swift/XRT follow-up covering the whole activity period shows that the\nX-ray emission was always dominated by a hard power-law component with a photon\nindex in the range of 1.4-1.7. These values are consistent with MAXI J1813-095\nbeing in the hard state, in agreement with the ~30 per cent fractional\nroot-mean-square amplitude of the fast variability (0.1-50 Hz) inferred from\nthe only XMM-Newton observation available. The X-ray spectra are well described\nby a Comptonization emission component plus a soft, thermal component (kT ~0.2\nkeV), which barely contributes to the total flux (<8 per cent). The\nComptonization y-parameter (~1.5), together with the low temperature and small\ncontribution of the soft component supports a black hole accretor. We also\nperformed optical spectroscopy using the VLT and GTC telescopes during outburst\nand quiescence, respectively. In both cases the spectrum lack emission lines\ntypical of X-ray binaries in outburst. Instead, we detect the Ca II triplet and\nH_alpha in absorption. The absence of velocity shifts between the two epochs,\nas well as the evolution of the H_alpha equivalent width, strongly suggest that\nthe optical emission is dominated by an interloper, likely a G-K star. This\nfavours a distance >3 kpc for the X-ray transient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Although variations are often measured in\npopulation context, the basic carriers of variation are individuals. Hence,\nmeasuring variations such as SNP of individual against a reference genome,\nwhich has been ignored currently, is certainly of its own right. Indeed,\nsimilar practice has been a tradition in ecology, where the basic framework of\ndiversity measure is individual community sample. We propose to use\nRenyi-entropy-derived Hill numbers to define SNP (single nucleotide\npolymorphism) diversity (including alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversities) and\nsimilarity profiles. Hill numbers are derived from Renyi entropy, of which\nShannon entropy is a special case and which have found widely applications\nincluding measuring the quantum information entanglement, wealth distribution\nin economics and ecological diversity.

The profile concept also helps to resolve a\ndilemma in measuring diversity: the choice from various diversity indexes,\nbecause diversity profile unifies some of the most commonly used indexes (as\nspecial cases) with different diversity orders (along the rareness-commonness\nspectrum of gene mutations). Finally, the profiles can be estimated with\nrarefaction approach, which may help to relieve some effect of insufficient\nsequencing coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 18:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

It is then important to develop\nmodels aimed at capturing this variety of dynamics. We have generalized the\nparticle-based multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) method to model the\ndynamics of nematic liquid crystals. Following the Qian--Sheng theory of\nnematics, the spatial and temporal variations of the nematic director field and\norder parameter are described by a tensor order parameter. The key idea is to\nassign tensorial degrees of freedom to each MPCD particle, whose mesoscopic\naverage is the tensor order parameter. This new nematic-MPCD method includes\nbackflow effect, velocity-orientation coupling and thermal fluctuations. We\nvalidate the applicability of this method by testing: (i) the nematic-isotropic\nphase transition, (ii) the flow alignment of the director in shear and\nPoiseuille flows, and (iii) the annihilation dynamics of a pair of line\ndefects. We find excellent agreement with existing literature. We also\ninvestigate the flow field around a force dipole in a nematic liquid crystal,\nwhich represents the leading-order flow field around a force-free microswimmer.\nThe anisotropy of the medium not only affects the magnitude of velocity field\naround the force dipole, but can also induce hydrodynamic torques depending on\nthe orientation of dipole axis relative to director field. A force dipole\nexperiences a hydrodynamic torque when the dipole axis is tilted with respect\nto the far-field director. The direction of hydrodynamic toque is such that the\npusher- (or puller-) type force dipole tends to orient along (or perpendicular\nto) the director field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 18:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

We carry out a comprehensive set of SPH simulations of wind-losing AGB\nstars in binaries, for a variety of binary mass ratios, orbital separations,\ninitial wind velocities and rotation rates of the donor star. The initial\nparameters of the simulated systems are chosen to match the expected\nprogenitors of CEMP stars.

Strong interaction\noccurs for close systems and comparable mass ratios, and gives rise to a\ncomplex morphology of the outflow and substantial angular-momentum loss, which\nleads to a shrinking of the orbit. As the orbital separation increases and the\nmass of the companion star decreases, the morphology of the outflow, as well as\nthe angular-momentum loss, become more similar to the spherically symmetric\nwind case. We also explore the effects of tidal interaction and find that for\norbital separations up to 7-10 AU, depending on mass ratio, spin-orbit coupling\nof the donor star occurs at some point during the AGB phase.

However, centralized RL is\ninfeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the\njoint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by\ndistributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new\nchallenges: now the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint\nof each local agent due to limited communication among agents. Most existing\nstudies in MARL focus on designing efficient communication and coordination\namong traditional Q-learning agents. This paper presents, for the first time, a\nfully scalable and decentralized MARL algorithm for the state-of-the-art deep\nRL agent: advantage actor critic (A2C), within the context of ATSC. In\nparticular, two methods are proposed to stabilize the learning procedure, by\nimproving the observability and reducing the learning difficulty of each local\nagent. The proposed multi-agent A2C is compared against independent A2C and\nindependent Q-learning algorithms, in both a large synthetic traffic grid and a\nlarge real-world traffic network of Monaco city, under simulated peak-hour\ntraffic dynamics.

Most\napproaches infer axon diameters from effects of time-dependent diffusion on the\ndiffusion-weighted MR signal by modelling axons as straight cylinders. Axons do\nnot, however, run in straight trajectories and so far, the impact of the axonal\ntrajectory on diameter estimation has not been systematically investigated.\nHere, we employ a toy-model of axons, which we refer to as undulating\nthin-fiber model, to analyze the impact of undulating trajectories on the\ndiffusion-time dependence represented by the diffusion spectrum. We analyze the\nspectrum by its height (diffusivity at high frequencies), width (half width at\nhalf maximum), and low-frequency behavior (power law exponent). Results show\nthat microscopic orientation dispersion of the thin-fibers is the main\nparameter that determines the characteristics of the diffusion spectra.\nStraight cylinders and undulating thin-fibers have virtually identical spectra\nat lower frequencies. If the straight-cylinder assumption is used to interpret\ndata from undulating thin axons, the diameter is overestimated by an amount\nproportional to the undulation amplitude and the microscopic orientation\ndispersion. At high frequencies (short diffusion times), spectra from cylinders\nand undulating thin-fibers differ. The spectra from the undulating thin-fibers\ncan also differ from that of cylinders by exhibiting power law behaviors with\nexponents below two. In conclusion, we argue that the non-straight nature of\naxonal trajectories should not be ignored when analyzing dMRI data and that\ncareful experiments may enable separation of diffusion within straight\ncylinders and diffusion in undulating thin-fibers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 18:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

This kind of system\nis expected to be within reach of the second generation of ground-based\ndetectors. In this context, we develop a series of versatile semi-analytical\nmodels to predict the properties of all the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts\nof BHNS mergers. We include the nuclear-decay-powered kilonova emission, its\nradio remnant, the prompt emission from the jet and the related afterglow. The\nproperties of these counterparts depend upon those of the outflows that result\nfrom the partial disruption of the NS during the merger and from the accretion\ndisc around the remnant, which are necessary ingredients for transient EM\nemission to accompany the GW signal. We therefore define ways to relate the\nproperties of these outflows to those of the progenitor binary, establishing a\nlink between the binary parameters and the counterpart properties. From the\nresulting model, we anticipate the variety of light curves that can emerge\nafter a BHNS coalescence, from the radio up to gamma-rays. These light curves\nfeature universal traits which are the imprint of the dynamics of the emitting\noutflows, but at the same time they show a clear dependence on the BH mass and\nspin, though with a high degree of degeneracy.

Recently, the data\nprogramming paradigm has been proposed to reduce the human cost in labeling\ntraining data. However, data programming relies on designing labeling functions\nwhich still requires significant domain expertise. Also, it is prohibitively\ndifficult to write labeling functions for image datasets as it is hard to\nexpress domain knowledge using raw features for images (pixels).\n  We propose affinity coding, a new domain-agnostic paradigm for automated\ntraining data labeling. The core premise of affinity coding is that the\naffinity scores of instance pairs belonging to the same class on average should\nbe higher than those of pairs belonging to different classes, according to some\naffinity functions. We build the GOGGLES system that implements affinity coding\nfor labeling image datasets by designing a novel set of reusable affinity\nfunctions for images, and propose a novel hierarchical generative model for\nclass inference using a small development set.\n  We compare GOGGLES with existing data programming systems on 5 image labeling\ntasks from diverse domains. GOGGLES achieves labeling accuracies ranging from a\nminimum of 71% to a maximum of 98% without requiring any extensive human\nannotation. In terms of end-to-end performance, GOGGLES outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art data programming system Snuba by 21% and a state-of-the-art\nfew-shot learning technique by 5%, and is only 7% away from the fully\nsupervised upper bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 19:19:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 02:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 06:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Using such a syntactic approach, ssFix is\nrelatively lightweight and was shown to outperform many other APR techniques.\nIn this paper, to investigate the true effectiveness of ssFix, we conducted\nmultiple experiments to validate ssFix's built-upon assumption (i.e., to see\nwhether it is often possible to reuse existing code for bug repair) and\nevaluate its code search and code reuse approaches. Our results show that while\nthe basic idea of ssFix, i.e., reusing existing code for bug repair, is\npromising, the approaches ssFix uses are not the best and can be significantly\nimproved.

At LHC and top RHIC energy, this implies the\nfluctuations are proportional to the integral of the balance function (BF),\n$B^{p\\bar p}$ of protons and anti-protons, while in the context of the RHIC\nbeam energy scan (BES), one must also account for correlations of \"stopped\"\nprotons. The integral of $B^{p\\bar p}$ measured in a $4\\pi$ detector depends on\nthe relative cross-sections of processes yielding $p\\bar p$ and those balancing\nthe proton baryon number via the production of other anti-baryons.

The magnitude of the measured second\norder cumulant of net proton fluctuations thus has much less to do with QCD\nsusceptibilities than with the creation/transport of baryons and anti-baryons\nin heavy-ion collisions, and most particularly the impact of radial flow on the\nwidth of the BF.

These examples demonstrate that LEAP, in\nspite of its generality, can match or best the performance of approaches that\nhave been especially crafted to solve very specific edge prediction problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

We\nmodel this phenomenon by extending classic two-species Lotka-Volterra\ncompetition in one spatial dimension to incorporate toxin production by one\nspecies. Considering solutions comprising two adjacent single-species colonies,\nwe show how the toxin inhibits the susceptible species near the interface\nbetween the two colonies. Moreover, a sufficiently effective toxin inhibits the\nsusceptible species to such a degree that an `inhibition zone' is formed\nseparating the two colonies. In the special case of truly non-motile bacteria,\ni.e. with zero bacterial diffusivity, we derive analytical expressions\ndescribing the bacterial distributions and size of the inhibition zone. In the\nmore general case of weakly motile bacteria, i.e. small bacterial diffusivity,\nthese two-colony solutions become travelling waves. We employ numerical methods\nto show that the wavespeed is dependent upon both interspecific competition and\ntoxin strength; precisely which colony expands at the expense of the other\ndepends upon the choice of parameter values. In particular, a sufficiently\neffective toxin allows the producer to expand at the expense of the\nsusceptible, with a wavespeed magnitude that is bounded above as the toxin\nstrength increases. This asymptotic wavespeed is independent of interspecific\ncompetition and due to the formation of the inhibition zone; when the colonies\nare thus separated, there is no longer direct competition between the two\nspecies and the producer can invade effectively unimpeded by its competitor. We\nnote that the minimum toxin strength required to produce an inhibition zone\nincreases rapidly with increasing bacterial diffusivity, suggesting that even\nmoderately motile bacteria must produce very strong toxins if they are to\nbenefit in this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 09:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

One key science goal for the next decade (and beyond) will be\nto characterize gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino sources using the next\ngeneration of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). These studies will have a\nbroad impact across astrophysics, informing our knowledge of the production and\nenrichment history of the heaviest chemical elements, constrain the dense\nmatter equation of state, provide independent constraints on cosmology,\nincrease our understanding of particle acceleration in shocks and jets, and\nstudy the lives of black holes in the universe. Future GW detectors will\ngreatly improve their sensitivity during the coming decade, as will\nnear-infrared telescopes capable of independently finding kilonovae from\nneutron star mergers. However, the electromagnetic counterparts to\nhigh-frequency (LIGO/Virgo band) GW sources will be distant and faint and thus\ndemand ELT capabilities for characterization. ELTs will be important and\nnecessary contributors to an advanced and complete multi-messenger network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 22:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Accurate and fast registration of\ncross-source 3D point clouds from different sensors is an emerged research\nproblem in computer vision. This problem is extremely challenging because\ncross-source point clouds contain a mixture of various variances, such as\ndensity, partial overlap, large noise and outliers, viewpoint changing. In this\npaper, an algorithm is proposed to align cross-source point clouds with both\nhigh accuracy and high efficiency. There are two main contributions: firstly,\ntwo components, the weak region affinity and pixel-wise refinement, are\nproposed to maintain the global and local information of 3D point clouds. Then,\nthese two components are integrated into an iterative tensor-based registration\nalgorithm to solve the cross-source point cloud registration problem. We\nconduct experiments on synthetic cross-source benchmark dataset and real\ncross-source datasets. Comparison with six state-of-the-art methods, the\nproposed method obtains both higher efficiency and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 22:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

In\nthe present work, we aim to extract the size reduced representation of complex\nnetworks such that new representation has the most relevant network nodes and\nconnections and retains its spectral properties. To achieve this, we use the\nSubset Selection (SS) procedure. The SS method, in general, is used to retrieve\nmaximum information from a matrix in terms of its most informative columns.

However, vehicle\nflow heterogeneity stems from many other aspects in general, e.g.,\nride-sourcing vehicles versus personal vehicles, human driven vehicles versus\nconnected and automated vehicles. Provided with some observations of vehicular\nflow for each class in a large-scale transportation network, how to estimate\nthe multi-class spatio-temporal vehicular flow, in terms of time-varying\nOrigin-Destination (OD) demand and path/link flow, remains a big challenge.\nThis paper presents a solution framework for multi-class dynamic OD demand\nestimation (MCDODE) in large-scale networks. The proposed framework is built on\na computational graph with tensor representations of spatio-temporal flow and\nall intermediate features involved in the MCDODE formulation. A\nforward-backward algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MCDODE\nformulation on computational graphs. In addition, we propose a novel concept of\ntree-based cumulative curves to estimate the gradient of OD demand. A Growing\nTree algorithm is developed to construct tree-based cumulative curves.

Existing deep FCNs suffer from heavy computations due to\na series of high-resolution feature maps for preserving the detailed knowledge\nin dense estimation. Although reducing the feature map resolution (i.e.,\napplying a large overall stride) via subsampling operations (e.g., pooling and\nconvolution striding) can instantly increase the efficiency, it dramatically\ndecreases the estimation accuracy. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a\nknowledge distillation method tailored for semantic segmentation to improve the\nperformance of the compact FCNs with large overall stride. To handle the\ninconsistency between the features of the student and teacher network, we\noptimize the feature similarity in a transferred latent domain formulated by\nutilizing a pre-trained autoencoder.

Indirect and direct effects are the part of\na treatment effect that is mediated by a covariate and the part that is not.\nSubsequent work on natural indirect and direct effects provides a formal causal\ninterpretation, based on cross-worlds counterfactuals: outcomes under treatment\nwith the mediator set to its value without treatment. Organic indirect and\ndirect effects (Lok 2016) avoid cross-worlds counterfactuals, using so-called\norganic interventions on the mediator while keeping the initial treatment fixed\nat treatment. Organic indirect and direct effects apply also to settings where\nthe mediator cannot be set. In linear models where the outcome model does not\nhave treatment-mediator interaction, both organic and natural indirect and\ndirect effects lead to the same estimators as in Baron and Kenny (1986). Here,\nwe generalize organic interventions on the mediator to include interventions\ncombined with the initial treatment fixed at no treatment. We show that the\nproduct method holds in linear models for organic indirect and direct effects\nrelative to no treatment even if there is treatment-mediator interaction.\nMoreover, we find a product method for binary mediators. Furthermore, we argue\nthat the organic indirect effect relative to no treatment is very relevant for\ndrug development. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by estimating the\norganic indirect effect of curative HIV-treatments mediated by two\nHIV-persistence measures, using ART-interruption data without curative\nHIV-treatments combined with an estimated/hypothesized effect of the curative\nHIV-treatments on these mediators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 01:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 15:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 18:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

However, reading medical images and\nmaking diagnosis or treatment recommendations require specially trained medical\nspecialists. The current practice of reading medical images is labor-intensive,\ntime-consuming, costly, and error-prone. It would be more desirable to have a\ncomputer-aided system that can automatically make diagnosis and treatment\nrecommendations. Recent advances in deep learning enable us to rethink the ways\nof clinician diagnosis based on medical images. In this thesis, we will\nintroduce 1) mammograms for detecting breast cancers, the most frequently\ndiagnosed solid cancer for U.S. women, 2) lung CT images for detecting lung\ncancers, the most frequently diagnosed malignant cancer, and 3) head and neck\nCT images for automated delineation of organs at risk in radiotherapy. First,\nwe will show how to employ the adversarial concept to generate the hard\nexamples improving mammogram mass segmentation. Second, we will demonstrate how\nto use the weakly labeled data for the mammogram breast cancer diagnosis by\nefficiently design deep learning for multi-instance learning. Third, the thesis\nwill walk through DeepLung system which combines deep 3D ConvNets and GBM for\nautomated lung nodule detection and classification. Fourth, we will show how to\nuse weakly labeled data to improve existing lung nodule detection system by\nintegrating deep learning with a probabilistic graphic model.

Nevertheless,\nmeshless methods based on EFG formulation, exhibit three major limitations: i)\nmeshless shape functions using higher order basis cannot always be computed for\narbitrarily distributed nodes (irregular node placement is crucial for\nfacilitating automated discretization of complex geometries); ii) imposition of\nthe Essential Boundary Conditions (EBC) is not straightforward; and, iii)\nnumerical (Gauss) integration in space is not exact as meshless shape functions\nare not polynomial. This paper presents a suite of Meshless Total Lagrangian\nExplicit Dynamics (MTLED) algorithms incorporating a Modified Moving Least\nSquares (MMLS) method for interpolating scattered data both for visualization\nand for numerical computations of soft tissue deformation, a novel way of\nimposing EBC for explicit time integration, and an adaptive numerical\nintegration procedure within the Meshless Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics\nalgorithm. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed methods is\ndemonstrated using comparisons with the established non-linear procedures from\ncommercial finite element software ABAQUS and experiments with very large\ndeformations. To demonstrate the translational benefits of MTLED we also\npresent a realistic brain-shift computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 07:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 04:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The spectra of the asteroid were taken with the\nlow resolution spectrograph (LISA), mounted on the 1.2-m telescope at the Mount\nAbu Infrared Observatory, India. Coming from a region close to the Hungaria\npopulation of asteroids, this asteroid follows a comet-like orbit with a\nrelatively high inclination and large eccentricity. Hence, we carried out\noptical spectroscopic observations of the asteroid to look for comet-like\nmolecular emissions or outbursts. However, the asteroid showed a featureless\nspectrum, devoid of any comet-like features. The asteroid's light curve was\nanalyzed using V band magnitudes derived from the spectra and the most likely\nsolution for the rotation of the asteroid was obtained. The absolute magnitude\n$H$ and the slope parameter $G$ were determined for the asteroid in V filter\nband using the IAU accepted standard two parameter H-G model. A peculiar,\nrarely found result from these observations is its phase bluing trend. The\nrelative B-V color index seems to decrease with increasing phase angle, which\nindicates a phase bluing trend. Such trends have seldom been reported in\nliterature. However, phase reddening in asteroids is very common.

In order to provide valuable information on this\nshort period limit, we observed ten totally eclipsing contact binaries with\norbital periods near this cut-off. By detailed analysis using W-D code, we\ndetermined that two of these systems are A-subtype contact binaries while the\nothers are W-subtype contact binaries and all the targets show shallow contact\nconfigurations. Half of the targets exhibit stellar spot activity and four of\nthem have third light. A statistical work on well studied USPCBs was carried\nout, and physical parameters of fifty-five USPCBs were obtained. Some common\nproperties for these systems were derived. Due to the study of the period-color\ndiagram of USPCBs, we found that the period-color relation of USPCBs is\ndifferent from other W UMa type contact binaries and USPCBs are metal poor old\nstars. In addition, the evolutionary states of these systems were discussed by\nconstructing the color-density diagram. We derived that the evolutionary states\nof the two components of USPCBs show identical characteristics of other contact\nbinaries despite slower evolutionary status caused by smaller mass.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nartificial intelligence (AI)-aided receiver (AI receiver) for a CP-free OFDM\nsystem. The AI receiver includes a channel estimation neural network (CE-NET)\nand a signal detection neural network based on orthogonal approximate message\npassing (OAMP), called OAMP-NET. The CE-NET is initialized by the least-square\nchannel estimation algorithm and refined by a linear minimum mean-squared error\nneural network. The OAMP-NET is established by unfolding the iterative OAMP\nalgorithm and adding several trainable parameters to improve the detection\nperformance. We first investigate their performance under different channel\nmodels through extensive simulation and then establish a real transmission\nsystem using a 5G rapid prototyping system for an over-the-air (OTA) test.\nBased on our study, the AI receiver can estimate time-varying channels with a\nsingle training phase.

In this paper, we compare\n25 applications from the official and third-party application stores delivering\ncracked applications. The behavioral analysis of applications is carried out on\nthree real devices equipped with different Android versions by using five\nindicators: requested permissions, CPU usage, RAM usage and the number of\nopened ports for TCP and HTTP. Based on these indicators, we compute an\napplication intention score and classify cracked applications as malicious or\nbenign.

The\nvortex flow showed significant substructure in the form of several intermittent\nchromospheric swirls.\n  We investigate the oscillatory behaviour of various physical parameters in\nthe vortex area, with a 2D wavelet analysis performed within the vortex flow\narea and in a quiet-Sun region (for comparison), using the same high spatial\nand temporal resolution Ha and Ca II 8542 CRISP observations, as well as\nDoppler velocities and FWHM derived from the Ha line profiles.\n  The vortex flow shows significant oscillatory power in the 3-5 min range that\npeaks around 4 min and behaves differently than the reference quiet-Sun region.\nOscillations reflect the cumulative action of different components such as\nswaying motions, rotation, and waves. The derived swaying motion periods are in\nthe range of 200-220 s, and the rotation periods are ~270 s for Ha and ~215 s\nfor Ca II. Periods increase with atmospheric height and seem to decrease with\nradial distance from the vortex centre, suggesting a deviation from a rigid\nrotation. The behaviour of power within the vortex flow as a function of period\nand height implies the existence of evanescent waves and the excitation of\ndifferent types of waves, such as magnetoacoustic (e.g. kink) or Alfven waves.\n  The vortex flow seems to be dominated by two motions: a transverse (swaying)\nmotion, and a rotational motion while oscillations point to the propagation of\nwaves within it. Nearby fibril-like flows could play an important role in the\nrotational modulation of the vortex flow. Indirect evidence exists that the\nstructure is magnetically supported while the central swirl seems to be acting\nas a \"central engine\" to the vortex flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 09:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

These positions mainly depend on the position of\nthe occulted star and the precision of the timing. We present Pluto's\nastrometric positions derived from 19 occultations from 1988 to 2016 (11 from\nMeza et al. (2019) and 8 from other publications).

From these\nastrometric positions, we derive an updated ephemeris of Pluto's system\nbarycentre using the NIMA code (Desmars et al., 2015). The astrometric\npositions are derived by fitting the occultation's light curves by a model of\nPluto's atmosphere. The fits provide the observed position of the body's centre\nfor a reference star position. Other publications usually provide circumstances\nof the occultation such as the coordinates of the stations, the timing, and the\nimpact parameter (i.e. the closest distance between the station and the centre\nof the shadow). From these parameters, we use a procedure based on the Bessel\nmethod to derive an astrometric position. We derive accurate Pluto's\nastrometric positions from 1988 to 2016.

This `conformal compensator model' is based on a conformal\ncoupling $A(\\varphi)$ between the Einstein and the Jordan frames. This couples\na second scalar field $\\lambda$ to the trace of the matter energy-momentum\ntensor, including the bare cosmological constant, and serves as a dynamical\nLagrange multiplier. As a result, the scalar $\\lambda$ relaxes to a value which\ncancels the contributions from the vacuum energy density to the Friedmann\nequation, and adjusts itself to changes of the vacuum energy density after\nmatter phase transitions. This circumvents Weinberg's theorem through the time\ndependence of the background scalar field $\\varphi$. The radiation era, where\nthe vacuum energy is annulled, is recovered in a natural manner. It is also\npossible to recover the matter era, via a tracking of the matter energy density\nby the scalar field, as well as the inflationary and dark energy eras, which\ncorrespond to regimes where the cancellation mechanism becomes inefficient.\nThis suggests that inflation, dark energy, and the annulation of the vacuum\nenergy density, could be related to the same mechanism.

The debate is nourished by the discrepant results from\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations, from pre-explosion imaging, and from\nstudies of host stellar populations. Here, we present a controlled experiment\nusing four solar metallicity models with zero-age main-sequence masses of 12,\n15, 20, and 25Msun. Because of the effects of core burning and surface mass\nloss, these models reach core collapse as red-supergiant (RSG) stars with a\nsimilar H-rich envelope mass of 8 to 9Msun but with final masses in the range\n11 to 16Msun. We explode the progenitors using a thermal bomb, adjusting the\nenergy deposition to yield an asymptotic ejecta kinetic energy of 1.25 x 10^51\nerg and an initial 56Ni mass of 0.04Msun. The resulting SNe produce similar\nphotometric and spectroscopic properties from 10 to 200d. The spectral\ncharacteristics are degenerate. The scatter in early-time color results from\nthe range in progenitor radii, while the differences in late-time spectra\nreflect the larger oxygen yields in more massive progenitors. Because the\nprogenitors have a comparable H-rich envelope mass, the photospheric phase\nduration is comparable for all models; the difference in He-core mass is\ninvisible. As different main-sequence masses can produce progenitors with a\nsimilar H-rich envelope mass, light curve modeling cannot provide a robust and\nunique solution for the ejecta mass of Type II-P SNe. The numerous\nuncertainties in massive star evolution and wind mass loss also prevent a\nrobust association with a main-sequence star mass.

By using the\ntight-binding Hamiltonian combining with the nonequilibrium Green's function\nmethod, the three elements of the spin current in the transverse leads and then\nspin Nernst coefficients are obtained. The results show that the spin Nernst\neffect in the Weyl semimetal has the essential difference with the traditional\none: The z direction spin currents is zero without the magnetic field while it\nappears under the magnetic field, and the x and y direction spin currents in\nthe two transverse leads flows out or flows in together, in contrary to the\ntraditional spin Nernst effect, in which the spin current is induced by the\nspin-orbit coupling and flows out from one lead and flows in on the other. So\nwe call it the anomalous spin Nernst effect. In addition, we show that the Weyl\nsemimetals have the center-reversal-type symmetry, the mirror-reversal-type\nsymmetry and the electron-hole-type symmetry, which lead to the spin Nernst\ncoefficients being odd function or even function of the Fermi energy, the\nmagnetic field and the transverse terminals. Moreover, the spin Nernst effect\nin the Weyl semimetals are strongly anisotropic and its coefficients are\nstrongly dependent on both the direction of thermal gradient and the direction\nof the transverse lead connection. Three non-equivalent connection modes (x-z,\nz-x and x-y modes) are studied in detail, and the spin Nernst coefficients for\nthree different modes exhibit very different behaviors.

However, its biological basis eludes many twenty-first\ncentury practitioners. A path from the nineteenth century recognition of the\ninformational basis of heredity to the modern era can be discerned. Crick's DNA\n\"unpairing postulate\" predicted that recombinational pairing of homologous DNAs\nduring meiosis would be mediated by short k-mers in the loops of stem-loop\nstructures extruded from classical duplex helices. The complementary \"kissing\"\nduplex loops - like tRNA anticodon-codon k-mer duplexes - would seed a more\nextensive pairing that would then extend until limited by lack of homology or\nother factors. Indeed, this became the principle behind alignment-based methods\nthat assessed similarity by degree of DNA-DNA reassociation in vitro. These are\nnow seen as less sensitive than alignment-free methods that are closely\nconsistent, both theoretically and mechanistically, with chromosomal\nanti-recombination models for the initiation of divergence into new species.\nThe analytical power of k-mer differences supports the theses that evolutionary\nadvance sometimes serves the needs of nucleic acids (genomes) rather than\nproteins (genes), and that such differences have often played a role in early\nspeciation events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 19:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

As concerns the regularity of weak solutions, say in Sobolev spaces\n$W^{\\alpha,p}$, we determine Onsager type exponents $\\alpha$ that guarantee the\nconservation of all entropies. In particular, the Onsager exponent $\\alpha$ is\nsmaller than $\\alpha = 1/3$ established for fluid models. Entropies\nconservation is equivalent to the renormalization property, which have been\nintroduced by DiPerna--Lions for studying well-posedness of passive transport\nequations and collisionless kinetic equations. For smooth solutions\nrenormalization property or entropies conservation are simply the consequence\nof the chain rule. For weak solutions the use of the chain rule is not always\njustified. Then arises the question about the minimal regularity needed for\nweak solutions to guarantee such properties. In the DiPerna--Lions and\nBouchut--Ambrosio theories, renormalization property holds under sufficient\nconditions in terms of the regularity of the advection field, which are roughly\nspeaking an entire derivative in some Lebesgue spaces (DiPerna--Lions) or an\nentire derivative in the space of measures with finite total variation\n(Bouchut--Ambrosio).

We collected\na dataset consisting of profile metadata of all 231,235 verified\nEnglish-speaking users (as of July 2018), a control sample of 175,930\nnon-verified English-speaking users and all their 494 million tweets over a one\nyear collection period. Our proposed models are able to reliably identify\nverification status (Area under curve AUC > 99%). We show that number of public\nlist memberships, presence of neutral sentiment in tweets and an authoritative\nlanguage style are the most pertinent predictors of verification status.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt at\ndiscerning and classifying verification worthy users on Twitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

When a\nself-generated or externally specified goal is given, a sequence of actions\nthat is most likely to attain that goal is selected among other candidates via\nmental simulation. Therefore, better mental simulation leads to better\ngoal-directed action planning. However, developing a mental simulation model is\nchallenging because it requires knowledge of self and the environment. The\ncurrent paper studies how adequate goal-directed action plans of robots can be\nmentally generated by dynamically organizing top-down visual attention and\nvisual working memory. For this purpose, we propose a neural network model\nbased on variational Bayes predictive coding, where goal-directed action\nplanning is formulated by Bayesian inference of latent intentional space. Our\nexperimental results showed that cognitively meaningful competencies, such as\nautonomous top-down attention to the robot end effector (its hand) as well as\ndynamic organization of occlusion-free visual working memory, emerged.\nFurthermore, our analysis of comparative experiments indicated that\nintroduction of visual working memory and the inference mechanism using\nvariational Bayes predictive coding significantly improve the performance in\nplanning adequate goal-directed actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 14:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Due to the small magnitudes of dZ signals,\nEIT parameters require optimization, which can be done using in silico\nmodelling: apart from predicting the best parameters for imaging, it can also\nhelp to validate experimental data and explain the nature of the observed dZ.\nThis has previously been completed for unmyelinated fibres, but an extension to\nmyelinated fibres is required for the development of a full nerve model which\ncould aid imaging neuronal traffic at the fascicular level and optimise\nneuromodulation of the supplied internal organs to treat various diseases.\nMethods: An active FEM model of a myelinated fibre coupled with external space\nwas developed. A spatial dimension was added to the experimentally validated\nspace-clamped model of a human sensory fibre using the double cable paradigm.\nElectrical parameters of the model were changed so that nodal and internodal\nmembrane potential as well as propagation velocity agreed with experimental\nvalues. dZ was simulated during activity under various conditions and the\noptimal parameters for imaging were determined. Main Results: When using AC, dZ\ncould be recorded only at frequencies above 4 kHz, which is supported by\nexperimental data.

When these are used in a predictive setting, a\ngreater number of explanatory variables are potentially related to the\ndependent variable (the response). Meanwhile, the number of acquisitions per\nexperiment remains limited. In such high dimension/small sample size setting,\nit is desirable to find the explanatory variables that are truly related to the\nresponse while controlling the rate of false discoveries. To achieve this goal,\nnovel multivariate inference procedures, such as knockoff inference, have been\nproposed recently.

In this paper,\nwe propose a new algorithm, called Ensemble of Clustered Knockoffs, that allows\nto select explanatory variables while controlling the false discovery rate\n(FDR), up to a prescribed spatial tolerance.

This comes from the accumulated\nphase of signal sidebands when propagating inside the arm cavities. One idea is\nto cancel such a phase by introducing an unstable optomechanical filter. The\noriginal design proposed in [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf 115},~211104 (2015)]\nrequires an additional optomechanical filter coupled externally to the main\ninterferometer. Here we consider a simplified design that converts the\nsignal-recycling cavity itself into the unstable filter by using one mirror as\na high-frequency mechanical oscillator and introducing an additional pump\nlaser. However, the enhancement in bandwidth of this new design is less than\nthe original design given the same set of optical parameters. The peak\nsensitivity improvement factor depends on the arm length, the signal-recycling\ncavity length, and the final detector bandwidth. For a 4~km interferometer, if\nthe final detector bandwidth is around 2~kHz, with a 20~m signal-recycling\ncavity, the shot noise can be reduced by 10 decibels, in addition to the\nimprovement introduced by squeezed light injection.

It is thus of no surprise that many different\ntheoretical cooling schemes have been proposed, differing in the assumed\ncontrol paradigm and complexity, and operating either in a single cycle or in\nsteady state limits. Working out bounds on quantum cooling has since been a\nhighly context dependent task with multiple answers, with no general result\nthat holds independent of assumptions. In this letter we derive a universal\nbound for cooling quantum systems in the limit of infinite cycles (or steady\nstate regimes) that is valid for any control paradigm and machine size. The\nbound only depends on a single parameter of the refrigerator and is\ntheoretically attainable in all control paradigms. For qubit targets we prove\nthat this bound is achievable in a single cycle and by autonomous machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 14:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 15:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

This will allow us to\naddress observationally the formation of brightest cluster galaxies and other\ncluster galaxy populations, the buildup of the intra-cluster light, the\nchemical enrichment history of the intra-cluster medium, and the formation and\ntriggering of supermassive black holes in dense environments, all of which are\ncurrently almost exclusively approached either through the fossil record in\nclusters or through numerical simulations.

In particular, gradient descent induces a dynamics of\nthe normalized weights which converge for $t \\to \\infty$ to an equilibrium\nwhich corresponds to a minimum norm (or maximum margin) solution. For\nsufficiently large but finite $\\rho$ -- and thus finite $t$ -- the dynamics\nconverges to one of several margin maximizers, with the margin monotonically\nincreasing towards a limit stationary point of the flow. In the usual case of\nstochastic gradient descent, most of the stationary points are likely to be\nconvex minima corresponding to a constrained minimizer -- the network with\nnormalized weights-- which corresponds to vanishing regularization.

On\nthe other hand, it seems that weaker notions of stability such as hypothesis\nstability, although it is distribution dependent and more amenable to\ncomputation, can only yield polynomial generalization bounds for the estimated\nrisk, which are suboptimal.\n  In this paper, we address the gap between these two regimes of results. In\nparticular, the main question we address here is \\emph{whether it is possible\nto derive exponential generalization bounds for the estimated risk using a\nnotion of stability that is computationally tractable and distribution\ndependent, but weaker than uniform stability. Using recent advances in\nconcentration inequalities, and using a notion of stability that is weaker than\nuniform stability but distribution dependent and amenable to computation, we\nderive an exponential tail bound for the concentration of the estimated risk of\na hypothesis returned by a general learning rule, where the estimated risk is\nexpressed in terms of either the resubstitution estimate (empirical error), or\nthe deleted (or, leave-one-out) estimate. As an illustration, we derive\nexponential tail bounds for ridge regression with unbounded responses, where we\nshow how stability changes with the tail behavior of the response variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 02:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 22:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

As we try to solve more\nadvanced problems, increasing demands for computing and power resources has\nbecome inevitable. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread\ninterest as the third-generation of neural networks due to their event-driven\nand low-powered nature. SNNs, however, are difficult to train, mainly owing to\ntheir complex dynamics of neurons and non-differentiable spike operations.\nFurthermore, their applications have been limited to relatively simple tasks\nsuch as image classification. In this study, we investigate the performance\ndegradation of SNNs in a more challenging regression problem (i.e., object\ndetection). Through our in-depth analysis, we introduce two novel methods:\nchannel-wise normalization and signed neuron with imbalanced threshold, both of\nwhich provide fast and accurate information transmission for deep SNNs.\nConsequently, we present a first spiked-based object detection model, called\nSpiking-YOLO. Our experiments show that Spiking-YOLO achieves remarkable\nresults that are comparable (up to 98%) to those of Tiny YOLO on non-trivial\ndatasets, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

With the `active pixel sensor' (APS), the `Dynamic and Active-pixel\nVision Sensor' (DAVIS) allows the simultaneous output of intensity frames and\nevents. However, the output images are captured at a relatively low frame rate\nand often suffer from motion blur. A blurred image can be regarded as the\nintegral of a sequence of latent images, while events indicate changes between\nthe latent images. Thus, we are able to model the blur-generation process by\nassociating event data to a latent sharp image. Based on the abundant event\ndata alongside a low frame rate, easily blurred images, we propose a simple yet\neffective approach to reconstruct high-quality and high frame rate sharp\nvideos. Starting with a single blurred frame and its event data from DAVIS, we\npropose the Event-based Double Integral (EDI) model and solve it by adding\nregularization terms. Then, we extend it to multiple Event-based Double\nIntegral (mEDI) model to get more smooth results based on multiple images and\ntheir events.

Our application of interest is the spreading of\nviscous gravity currents in the study of which these type of differential\nequations arise. Viscous gravity currents are low Reynolds number (viscous\nforces dominate inertial forces) flow phenomena in which a dense, viscous fluid\ndisplaces a lighter (usually immiscible) fluid. The fluids may be confined by\nthe sidewalls of a channel or propagate in an unconfined two-dimensional (or\naxisymmetric three-dimensional) geometry. Under the lubrication approximation,\nthe mathematical description of the spreading of these fluids reduces to\nsolving the so-called thin-film equation for the current's shape $h(x,t)$. To\nsolve such nonlinear parabolic equations we propose a finite-difference scheme\nbased on the Crank--Nicolson idea. We implement the scheme for problems\ninvolving a single spatial coordinate (i.e., two-dimensional, axisymmetric or\nspherically-symmetric three-dimensional currents) on an equispaced but\nstaggered grid.
