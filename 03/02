In this system, two radio frequency (RF) users are\ngrouped for simultaneous transmissions, over each resource block, to an\nintermediate relay. The relay then forwards the amplified version of the users'\naggregated signals, in the presence of multiuser interference, to a relatively\nfar destination. In order to cope with the users' ever-increasing desire for\nhigher data rates, a high-throughput free-space optics (FSO) link is employed\nas the relay-destination backhaul link. It is assumed that the FSO backhaul\nlink is subject to Gamma-Gamma turbulence with pointing error. Also, a Rayleigh\nfading model is considered for the user-relay access links. Under these\nassumptions, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and\ntractable forms, involving only one-dimensional integrals, for the ergodic\ncapacity. Moreover, the outage probability and ergodic capacity analysis are\nextended to the conventional RF-backhauled systems in the presence of multiuser\ninterference to both relay and destination nodes, and Rician fading for the\nrelay-destination RF link. Our results reveal the superiority of FSO\nbackhauling for high-throughput and high-reliability NOMA systems compared to\nRF backhauling. This work can be considered as a general analysis of dual-hop\nuplink NOMA systems as well as the first attempt to incorporate power-domain\nNOMA in mixed RF-FSO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 16:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 05:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

In particular, we observe that\ncorrelations among inputs induce effective dependencies among parameters thus\nconstraining the model and, consequently, reducing its complexity. We derive\nsimple relations for the upper and lower bounds of the complexity. Furthermore,\nwe show analytically that, defining the model parameters on a finite support\nrather than the entire axis, decreases the complexity in a manner that\ncritically depends on the size of the domain. Based on our findings, we propose\na novel model selection criterion which takes into account the entropy of the\ninput distribution.

In the last decade, major innovations have taken place incorporating\nsupervised ML tools into estimators for causal parameters such as the average\ntreatment effect (ATE).

Controlling thermal noise, especially using laser light to apply\ndissipation, substantially affects science in revealing the quantum regime of\ngases, in searching for fundamental physics, and in realizing practical\napplications. Recently, nonlinear light-matter interactions in microresonators\nhave opened up new classes of microscopic devices. A key example is\nKerr-microresonator frequency combs; so-called soliton microcombs not only\nexplore nonlinear science but also enable integrated-photonics devices, such as\noptical synthesizers, optical clocks, and data-communications systems. Here, we\nexplore how thermal noise leads to fundamental decoherence of soliton\nmicrocombs.

Our experiments utilize\nrecord sensitivity in carrier-envelope-offset frequency detection in order to\nuncover this regime of strong thermal-noise correlations.

The celebrated Shannon-Nyquist theorem guarantees\nperfect signal reconstruction from uniform samples, obtained at a rate twice\nthe maximum frequency present in the signal. Unfortunately a large number of\nsignals of interest are far from being band-limited. This motivated research on\nreconstruction from sub-Nyquist samples, which mainly hinges on the use of\nrandom / incoherent sampling procedures. However, uniform or regular sampling\nis more appealing in practice and from the system design point of view, as it\nis far simpler to implement, and often necessary due to system constraints. In\nthis work, we study regular sampling and reconstruction of three- or\nhigher-dimensional signals (tensors). We show that reconstructing a tensor\nsignal from regular samples is feasible. Under the proposed framework, the\nsample complexity is determined by the tensor rank---rather than the signal\nbandwidth. This result offers new perspectives for designing practical regular\nsampling patterns and systems for signals that are naturally tensors, e.g.,\nimages and video. For a concrete application, we show that functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) acceleration is a tensor sampling problem, and design\npractical sampling schemes and an algorithmic framework to handle it. Numerical\nresults show that our tensor sampling strategy accelerates the fMRI sampling\nprocess significantly without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 17:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Thus, the observed tail direction can be misleading,\nand we caution against naive conclusions regarding the subhalo's direction of\nmotion based on the tail direction.

Most recent studies have\nfocused on Majorana bound states which can serve as topological qubits. More\ngenerally, akin to elementary particles, Majorana fermions can propagate and\ndisplay linear dispersion. These excitations have not yet been directly\nobserved, and can also be used for quantum information processing. One route to\nrealizing this is in a line junction between two phase-shifted superconductors\ncoupled to topological surface states. Recent theory indicates that in\niron-based superconductors, a particular type of crystalline defect, i.e., a\ndomain wall (DW) between two regions with a half-unit cell shift between them,\nshould create a $\\pi$-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter.\nCombined with recent data showing topological surface states in\nFeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ we find that this is the ideal system to realize helical\n1D-dispersing Majorana modes. Here we report scanning tunneling spectroscopic\n(STS) measurements of crystalline DWs in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. By analyzing\nlarge-area superconducting gap maps, we identify the gap in the topological\nsurface state, demonstrating that our sample is an effective Fu-Kane\nproximitized topological system. We further locate DWs across which the atoms\nshift by half a unit cell. STS data on these DWs reveal a flat density of\nstates inside the superconducting gap, a hallmark of linearly dispersing modes\nin 1D. This unique signature is absent in DWs in the related superconductor,\nFeSe which is not in the topological phase. Our combined data are consistent\nwith the observation of dispersing Majorana states at a $\\pi$-phase shift DW in\na proximitized topological material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 19:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 15:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The pseudo panel and the preferences it intends to\ndescribe is constructed at the individual level and is not affected by\naggregation bias across cohorts. This is accomplished by creating a\nhigh-dimensional probabilistic model representation of the entire data set,\nwhich allows sampling from the probabilistic model in such a way that all of\nthe intrinsic correlation properties of the original data are preserved. The\nkey to this is the use of deep learning algorithms based on the Conditional\nVariational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework. From a modelling perspective, the\nconcept of a model-based resampling creates a number of opportunities in that\ndata can be organized and constructed to serve very specific needs of which the\nforming of heterogeneous pseudo panels represents one. The advantage, in that\nrespect, is the ability to trade a serious aggregation bias (when aggregating\ninto cohorts) for an unsystematic noise disturbance. Moreover, the approach\nmakes it possible to explore high-dimensional sparse preference distributions\nand their linkage to individual specific characteristics, which is not possible\nif applying traditional pseudo-panel methods. We use the presented approach to\nreveal the dynamics of transport preferences for a fixed pseudo panel of\nindividuals based on a large Danish cross-sectional data set covering the\nperiod from 2006 to 2016. The model is also utilized to classify individuals\ninto 'slow' and 'fast' movers with respect to the speed at which their\npreferences change over time. It is found that the prototypical fast mover is a\nyoung woman who lives as a single in a large city whereas the typical slow\nmover is a middle-aged man with high income from a nuclear family who lives in\na detached house outside a city.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 19:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Because it is\ncomputationally intractable to optimize over all possible multi-year sequences\nof observations, schedulers use heuristics to pick the best observation at a\ngiven time. A greedy scheduler selects the next observation by choosing\nwhichever one maximizes a scalar merit function, which serves as a proxy for\nthe scientific goals of the telescope. This sort of bottom-up approach for\nscheduling is not guaranteed to produce a schedule for which the sum of merit\nover all observations is maximized. As an alternative to greedy schedulers, we\nintroduce ALTSched, which takes a top-down approach to scheduling. Instead of\nconsidering only the next observation, ALTSched makes global decisions about\nwhich area of sky and which filter to observe in, and then refines these\ndecisions into a sequence of observations taken along the meridian to maximize\nSNR.

Here, in\ncontrast to this widely used tight-binding approach, we formulate the problem\nusing a highly accurate plane-wave representation of the atomic\n(pseudo)-potentials. We develop a new approach that separately deals with the\nintrinsic Hamiltonian, containing the potential due to the atomic\nconfiguration, and the extrinsic Hamiltonian, related to the external\npotential. We realize efficient performance by implementing a finite-element\nlike partition-of-unity approach combining linear shape functions with\nBloch-wave enhancement functions. We match the performance of previous\ntight-binding approaches, while retaining the benefits of a plane wave based\nmodel.

Their resemblance to traditional viscous\nfingering patterns in driven fluids suggests that epithelial fingers could\narise from an interfacial instability. However, the existence and physical\nmechanism of such a putative instability remain unclear. Here, based on an\nactive polar fluid model for epithelial spreading, we analytically predict a\ngeneric instability of the tissue front. On the one hand, active cellular\ntraction forces impose a velocity gradient that leads to an accelerated front,\nwhich is, thus, unstable to long-wavelength perturbations. On the other hand,\ncontractile intercellular stresses typically dominate over surface tension in\nstabilizing short-wavelength perturbations. Finally, the finite range of\nhydrodynamic interactions in the tissue selects a wavelength for the fingering\npattern, which is, thus, given by the smallest between the tissue size and the\nhydrodynamic screening length. Overall, we show that spreading epithelia\nexperience an active fingering instability based on a simple kinematic\nmechanism.

Roughly speaking, graph-based classification methods include\ncollective classification and graph neural network. Evading a graph-based\nclassification method enables an attacker to evade detection in security\nanalytics and can be used as a privacy defense against inference attacks.\nExisting adversarial machine learning studies mainly focused on machine\nlearning for non-graph data. Only a few recent studies touched adversarial\ngraph-based classification methods. However, they focused on graph neural\nnetwork methods, leaving adversarial collective classification largely\nunexplored. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. We first propose a threat\nmodel to characterize the attack surface of a collective classification method.\nSpecifically, we characterize an attacker's background knowledge along three\ndimensions: parameters of the method, training dataset, and the complete graph;\nan attacker's goal is to evade detection via manipulating the graph structure.\nWe formulate our attack as a graph-based optimization problem, solving which\nproduces the edges that an attacker needs to manipulate to achieve its attack\ngoal. Moreover, we propose several approximation techniques to solve the\noptimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with a recent\nattack designed for graph neural networks.

A fast CME launched from the Sun on November 29\n2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and\nlater STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER\nremained in the solar wind as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards\ntowards Mercury's surface until it reached and passed its closest approach to\nthe planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the magnetosphere. The\nmagnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet's\nnightside at 400 km altitude and 84$^\\circ$N latitude, indicating the lack of\ndayside magnetosphere on this orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field\nmeasured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the values measured in the\norbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric\ncompression. Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A,\nwe show that the extremely high ram pressure associated with this ICME was more\nthan high enough to collapse Mercury's weak magnetosphere. As a consequence,\nthe ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury's surface, evidenced by enhanced\nsodium ions in the exosphere.

Moreover, we develop a variety of approximation\ntechniques that enhance the practical applicability of our formalism.\nGeneralizations and approximations are developed for both equations of motion\nand correlation functions. Our formalism is demonstrated for the important case\nof spin relaxation in a time-dependent external magnetic field. The Bloch\nequations are derived together with microscopic expressions for the relaxation\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 00:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

We\nreport research whose goal is to learn about the attributes of very high risk\nIPV perpetrators and the circumstances associated with their IPV incidents\nreported to the police. Very high risk is defined as having a high probability\nof committing a repeat IPV assault in which the victim is injured. Such\nindividuals represent a very small fraction of all IPV perpetrators; these acts\nof violence are relatively rare. To learn about them nevertheless, we apply in\na novel fashion three algorithms sequentially to data collected from a large\nmetropolitan police department: stochastic gradient boosting, a genetic\nalgorithm inspired by natural selection, and agglomerative clustering. We try\nto characterize not just perpetrators who on balance are predicted to\nre-offend, but who are very likely to re-offend in a manner that leads to\nvictim injuries. With this strategy, we learn a lot. We also provide a new way\nto estimate the importance of risk predictors.

It can be\nplugged into single-shot detectors with feature pyramid structure. The FSAF\nmodule addresses two limitations brought up by the conventional anchor-based\ndetection: 1) heuristic-guided feature selection; 2) overlap-based anchor\nsampling. The general concept of the FSAF module is online feature selection\napplied to the training of multi-level anchor-free branches. Specifically, an\nanchor-free branch is attached to each level of the feature pyramid, allowing\nbox encoding and decoding in the anchor-free manner at an arbitrary level.\nDuring training, we dynamically assign each instance to the most suitable\nfeature level. At the time of inference, the FSAF module can work jointly with\nanchor-based branches by outputting predictions in parallel. We instantiate\nthis concept with simple implementations of anchor-free branches and online\nfeature selection strategy. Experimental results on the COCO detection track\nshow that our FSAF module performs better than anchor-based counterparts while\nbeing faster. When working jointly with anchor-based branches, the FSAF module\nrobustly improves the baseline RetinaNet by a large margin under various\nsettings, while introducing nearly free inference overhead.

The $\\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is used to quantify the\nperformance of the system in the presence of persistent disturbances or\ntransient faults.

Many overtones are typically excited to observable\namplitudes, giving a rich spectrum of detectable modes. These modes provide a\nwealth of information on fundamental stellar properties. However, the radial\nvelocity shifts induced by these oscillations can also be problematic when\nsearching for low-mass, long-period planets; this is because their amplitudes\nare large enough to completely mask such minute planetary signals. Here we show\nhow fine-tuning exposure times to the stellar parameters can help efficiently\naverage out the solar-like-oscillation-induced shifts. To reduce the\noscillation signal to the radial velocity precision commensurate with an\nEarth-analogue, we find that for cool, low-mass stars (near spectral type K)\nthe necessary exposure times may be as short as 4 minutes, while for hotter,\nhigher-mass stars (near spectral type F, or slightly evolved) the required\nexposure times can be longer than 100 minutes. We provide guideline exposure\ndurations required to suppress the total observed amplitude due to oscillations\nto a level of $0.1\\,\\rm m\\,s^{-1}$, and a level corresponding to the\nEarth-analogue reflex amplitude for the star. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic\nvariability of the oscillations, we recommend in practice choosing short\nexposure durations at the telescope and then averaging over those exposures\nlater, as guided by our predictions.

In company with the fantastic\neffectiveness in classification, DNNs could also exhibit incorrect behaviors\nand result in accidents and losses. Therefore, testing techniques that can\ndetect incorrect DNN behaviors and improve DNN quality are extremely necessary\nand critical. However, the testing oracle, which defines the correct output for\na given input, is often not available in the automated testing. To obtain the\noracle information, the testing tasks of DNN-based systems usually require\nexpensive human efforts to label the testing data, which significantly slows\ndown the process of quality assurance.\n  To mitigate this problem, we propose DeepGini, a test prioritization\ntechnique designed based on a statistical perspective of DNN. Such a\nstatistical perspective allows us to reduce the problem of measuring\nmisclassification probability to the problem of measuring set impurity, which\nallows us to quickly identify possibly-misclassified tests. To evaluate, we\nconduct an extensive empirical study on popular datasets and prevalent DNN\nmodels. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepGini outperforms existing\ncoverage-based techniques in prioritizing tests regarding both effectiveness\nand efficiency.

We use it to explain the dynamic behaviors of the human\nconnected to the exoskeleton, in particular the observed non-zero low frequency\nphase shift and the near constant damping ratio of the resonant as stiffness\nand inertia vary. We validate this concept by experimenting with an elbow-joint\nexoskeleton testbed on a subject while modifying joint stiffness behavior,\nexoskeleton inertia, and strength augmentation gains. We compare three\ndifferent models of elbow-joint dynamic stiffness: a model with real stiffness,\nviscous damping and inertia, a model with complex stiffness and inertia, and a\nmodel combining the previous two models. Our results show that the hysteretic\ndamping term improves modeling accuracy, using a statistical F-test. Moreover\nthis improvement is statistically more significant than using classical viscous\ndamping term. In addition, we experimentally observe a linear relationship\nbetween the hysteretic damping and the real part of the stiffness which allows\nus to simplify the complex stiffness model as a 1-parameter system.

For second step, the pretrained model is fine-tuned to achieve better\nperformance under analysis of the raw training data. An adaptive weighting\nmethod is proposed in the third step to fuse local quality inspired by the\nperceptual property of the human visual system (HVS) that the HVS is sensitive\nto image patches containing texture and edge information.

Comparing with previous\nmodel-based RL, we show TG is more effective. We also present a TG hypothesis\nthat gives the influence of different fidelity levels of TG. For real games\nthat have unequal state and action spaces, we proposed a novel XfrNet of which\nusefulness is validated while achieving a 90% win-rate against the cheating\nLevel-10 AI.

Given the variety of products\nsold on popular eCommerce platforms, it is hard to consider all available\nproduct attributes as part of the modeling exercise, considering that products\npossess their own unique set of attributes based on category.

While the use of LETOR for web search has been well studied, its use\nfor E-Com search has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we discuss the\npractical challenges in applying learning to rank methods to E-Com search,\nincluding the challenges in feature representation, obtaining reliable\nrelevance judgments, and optimally exploiting multiple user feedback signals\nsuch as click rates, add-to-cart ratios, order rates, and revenue. We study\nthese new challenges using experiments on industry data sets and report several\ninteresting findings that can provide guidance on how to optimally apply LETOR\nto E-Com search: First, popularity-based features defined solely on product\nitems are very useful and LETOR methods were able to effectively optimize their\ncombination with relevance-based features. Second, query attribute sparsity\nraises challenges for LETOR, and selecting features to reduce/avoid sparsity is\nbeneficial. Third, while crowdsourcing is often useful for obtaining relevance\njudgments for Web search, it does not work as well for E-Com search due to\ndifficulty in eliciting sufficiently fine grained relevance judgments. Finally,\namong the multiple feedback signals, the order rate is found to be the most\nrobust training objective, followed by click rate, while add-to-cart ratio\nseems least robust, suggesting that an effective practical strategy may be to\ninitially use click rates for training and gradually shift to using order rates\nas they become available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 22:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

For example, subtle changes\nto the background or texture of an image can break a seemingly powerful\nclassifier. Building on previous work on domain generalization, we hope to\nproduce a classifier that will generalize to previously unseen domains, even\nwhen domain identifiers are not available during training. This setting is\nchallenging because the model may extract many distribution-specific\n(superficial) signals together with distribution-agnostic (semantic) signals.\nTo overcome this challenge, we incorporate the gray-level co-occurrence matrix\n(GLCM) to extract patterns that our prior knowledge suggests are superficial:\nthey are sensitive to the texture but unable to capture the gestalt of an\nimage. Then we introduce two techniques for improving our networks'\nout-of-sample performance. The first method is built on the reverse gradient\nmethod that pushes our model to learn representations from which the GLCM\nrepresentation is not predictable. The second method is built on the\nindependence introduced by projecting the model's representation onto the\nsubspace orthogonal to GLCM representation's.

We also extend an algorithm of Boucher and Ulmer \\cite{BF3} to\nconstruct self-dual skew cyclic codes based on the least common left multiples\nof non-commutative polynomials over $\\mathbb{F}_q+u\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 08:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

One means of\nimproving public speaking skills is practice through improvisation, e.g.\npresenting an improvised presentation using an unseen slide deck. We present\nTEDRIC, a novel system capable of generating coherent slide decks based on a\nsingle topic suggestion. It combines semantic word webs with text and image\ndata sources to create an engaging slide deck with an overarching theme. We\nfound that audience members perceived the quality of improvised presentations\nusing these generated slide decks to be on par with presentations using human\ncreated slide decks for the Improvised TED Talk performance format. TEDRIC is\nthus a valuable new creative tool for improvisers to perform with, and for\nanyone looking to improve their presentation skills.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 10:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

As an initial step towards\nthis vision, we investigate the integration of VO2 switches in reconfigurable\ncomponents at 15 GHz. In particular, a frequency reconfigurable antenna and a\nreconfigurable phase shifter are shown. The low loss and minimal parasitics of\nVO2 technology have the potential to enable devices at 15 GHz and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 14:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
