We want to find a structure to estimate the quantity $|X\n\\cap h|/|X|$ for any range $h \\in \\mathcal{R}$ with the $(\\rho,\n\\epsilon)$-guarantee: (i) if $|X \\cap h|/|X| > \\rho$, the estimate must have a\nrelative error $\\epsilon$; (ii) otherwise, the estimate must have an absolute\nerror $\\rho \\epsilon$. The objective is to minimize the size of the structure.\nCurrently, the dominant solution is to compute a relative $(\\rho,\n\\epsilon)$-approximation, which is a subset of $X$ with\n$\\tilde{O}(\\lambda/(\\rho \\epsilon^2))$ points, where $\\lambda$ is the\nVC-dimension of $(X, \\mathcal{R}|_X)$, and $\\tilde{O}$ hides polylog factors.\n  This paper shows a more general bound sensitive to the content of $X$. We\ngive a structure that stores $O(\\log (1/\\rho))$ integers plus $\\tilde{O}(\\theta\n\\cdot (\\lambda/\\epsilon^2))$ points of $X$, where $\\theta$ - called the\ndisagreement coefficient - measures how much the ranges differ from each other\nin their intersections with $X$. The value of $\\theta$ is between 1 and\n$1/\\rho$, such that our space bound is never worse than that of relative\n$(\\rho, \\epsilon)$-approximations, but we improve the latter's $1/\\rho$ term\nwhenever $\\theta = o(\\frac{1}{\\rho \\log (1/\\rho)})$. We also prove that, in the\nworst case, summaries with the $(\\rho, 1/2)$-guarantee must consume\n$\\Omega(\\theta)$ words even for $d = 2$ and $\\lambda \\le 3$.\n  We then constrain $\\mathcal{R}$ to be the set of halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\nfor a constant $d$, and prove the existence of structures with $o(1/(\\rho\n\\epsilon^2))$ size offering $(\\rho,\\epsilon)$-guarantees, when $X$ is generated\nfrom various stochastic distributions.

The key idea underlying our approach is\nto use the commuting conserved charges of the quantum integrable models to\ngenerate bases in which their spectral problem is separated, i.e. in which the\nwave functions are factorized in terms of specific solutions of a functional\nequation. For the so-called \"non-fundamental\" models we construct two different\ntypes of SoV bases. The first is given from the fundamental quantum Lax\noperator having isomorphic auxiliary and quantum spaces and that can be\nobtained by fusion of the original quantum Lax operator. The construction\nessentially follows the one we used previously for fundamental models and\nallows us to derive the simplicity and diagonalizability of the transfer matrix\nspectrum. Then, starting from the original quantum Lax operator and using the\nfull tower of the fused transfer matrices, we introduce a second type of SoV\nbases for which the proof of the separation of the transfer matrix spectrum is\nnaturally derived. We show that, under some special choice, this second type of\nSoV bases coincides with the one associated to Sklyanin's approach. Moreover,\nwe derive the finite difference type (quantum spectral curve) functional\nequation and the set of its solutions defining the complete transfer matrix\nspectrum. This is explicitly implemented for the integrable quantum models\nassociated to the higher spin representations of the general quasi-periodic\nY(gl2) Yang-Baxter algebra. Our SoV approach also leads to the construction of\na Q-operator in terms of the fused transfer matrices. Finally, we show that the\nQ-operator family can be equivalently used as the family of commuting conserved\ncharges enabling to construct our SoV bases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 16:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

However,\nthese perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change\nthe input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the\nexpected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the\ngrowing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on\nmachine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial\nattacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and\npost-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that\nexisting methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the\naforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in\nchanges in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate\nthat adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial\nperturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change\nthe output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial\ntraining with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of\nadversarial robustness, without hurting test performance.

Having estimated the gesture window, a support vector machine is employed\nto recognize the specific gesture. Our proposed method is evaluated by means of\na small-scale pilot study at FORTH and demonstrated that GestureKeeper can\nidentify correctly the start of a gesture with a 87\\% mean balanced accuracy\nand classify correctly the specific hand-gesture with a mean accuracy of over\n96\\%. To the best of our knowledge, GestureKeeper is the first automatic\nhand-gesture identification system based only on accelerometer. The performance\nanalysis reveals the predictive power of the features and the system's\nrobustness in the presence of additive noise. We also performed a sensitivity\nanalysis to examine the impact of various parameters and a comparative analysis\nof different classifiers (SVM, random forests). Most importantly, the system\ncan be extended to incorporate a large dictionary of gestures and operate\nwithout further calibration for a new user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 16:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

Existing\nmanipulation pipelines typically specify the desired configuration as a target\n6-DOF pose and rely on explicitly estimating the pose of the manipulated\nobjects. However, representing an object with a parameterized transformation\ndefined on a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape\nvariation, and specifying a target pose at a category level can be physically\ninfeasible or fail to accomplish the task -- e.g. knowing the pose and size of\na coffee mug relative to some canonical mug is not sufficient to successfully\nhang it on a rack by its handle. Hence we propose a novel formulation of\ncategory-level manipulation that uses semantic 3D keypoints as the object\nrepresentation. This keypoint representation enables a simple and interpretable\nspecification of the manipulation target as geometric costs and constraints on\nthe keypoints, which flexibly generalizes existing pose-based manipulation\nmethods. Using this formulation, we factor the manipulation policy into\ninstance segmentation, 3D keypoint detection, optimization-based robot action\nplanning and local dense-geometry-based action execution. This factorization\nallows us to leverage advances in these sub-problems and combine them into a\ngeneral and effective perception-to-action manipulation pipeline.

The Myerson-Satterthwaite\nimpossibility theorem shows that even for bilateral trade, there is no feasible\n(IR, truthful, budget balanced) mechanism that has welfare as high as the\noptimal-yet-infeasible VCG mechanism, which attains maximal welfare but runs a\ndeficit. On the other hand, the optimal feasible mechanism needs to be\ncarefully tailored to the Bayesian prior, and is extremely complex, eluding a\nprecise description.\n  We present Bulow-Klemperer-style results to circumvent these hurdles in\ndouble-auction markets. We suggest using the Buyer Trade Reduction (BTR)\nmechanism, a variant of McAfee's mechanism, which is feasible and simple (in\nparticular, deterministic, truthful, prior-independent, anonymous). First, in\nthe setting where buyers' and sellers' values are sampled i.i.d. from the same\ndistribution, we show that for any such market of any size, BTR with one\nadditional buyer whose value is sampled from the same distribution has expected\nwelfare at least as high as the optimal in the original market.\n  We then move to a more general setting where buyers' values are sampled from\none distribution and sellers' from another, focusing on the case where the\nbuyers' distribution first-order stochastically dominates the sellers'. We\npresent bounds on the number of buyers that, when added, guarantees that BTR in\nthe augmented market have welfare at least as high as the optimal in the\noriginal market. Our lower bounds extend to a large class of mechanisms, and\nall of our results extend to adding sellers instead of buyers.

We have two main goals for this note. First, we hope to make the parity\nanomaly more accessible to condensed matter physicists, who generally prefer to\nwork within the Hamiltonian formalism. The parity anomaly plays an important\nrole in modern condensed matter physics, as the massless Dirac fermion is the\nsurface theory of the time-reversal invariant topological insulator (TI) in\n$3+1$ dimensions. Our second goal is to clarify the relation between the\ntime-reversal symmetry of the massless Dirac fermion and the fractional charge\nof $\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ (in units of $e$) which appears on the surface of the TI\nwhen a magnetic monopole is present in the bulk. To accomplish these goals we\nstudy the Dirac fermion in the Hamiltonian formalism using two different\nregularization schemes. One scheme is consistent with the time-reversal\nsymmetry of the massless Dirac fermion, but leads to the aforementioned\nfractional charge. The second scheme does not lead to any fractionalization,\nbut it does break time-reversal symmetry. For both regularization schemes we\nalso compute the effective action $S_{\\text{eff}}[A]$ which encodes the\nresponse of the Dirac fermion to a background electromagnetic field $A$. We\nfind that the two effective actions differ by a Chern-Simons counterterm with\nfractional level equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$, as is expected from path integral\ntreatments of the parity anomaly. Finally, we propose the study of a bosonic\nanalogue of the parity anomaly as a topic for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 18:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

These are deterministic simulation models describing the dynamics of\nthe atmosphere, and evolving the current conditions forward in time to obtain a\nprediction for future atmospheric states. To account for uncertainty in NWP\nmodels it has become common practice to employ ensembles of NWP forecasts.\nHowever, NWP ensembles often exhibit forecast biases and dispersion errors,\nthus require statistical postprocessing to improve reliability of the ensemble\nforecasts. This work proposes an extension of a recently developed\npostprocessing model utilizing autoregressive information present in the\nforecast error of the raw ensemble members. The original approach is modified\nto let the variance parameter depend on the ensemble spread, yielding a\ntwo-fold heteroscedastic model. Furthermore, an additional high-resolution\nforecast is included into the postprocessing model, yielding improved\npredictive performance. Finally, it is outlined how the autoregressive model\ncan be utilized to postprocess ensemble forecasts with higher forecast\nhorizons, without the necessity of making fundamental changes to the original\nmodel. We accompany the new methodology by an implementation within the R\npackage ensAR to make our method available for other researchers working in\nthis area. To illustrate the performance of the heteroscedastic extension of\nthe autoregressive model, and its use for higher forecast horizons we present a\ncase study for a data set containing 12 years of temperature forecasts and\nobservations over Germany.

This paper uses grading data from a single series of\ncourses offered over a period of 10 years to show that the grade distributions\nemerging from these two grade scales differed in many ways from each other.\nEvidence suggests that the differences are due more to the grade scale than to\neither the students or the instructors. One major difference is that the\nfraction of students given grades less than C- was over 5 times larger when\ninstructors used the percent scale. The fact that each instructor who used both\ngrade scales gave more than 4 times as many of these low grades under percent\nscale grading suggests that the effect is due to the grade scale rather than\nthe instructor. When the percent scale was first introduced in these courses in\n2006, one of the authors of this paper, who is also one of the instructors in\nthis data set, had confidently predicted that any changes in course grading\nwould be negligible.

For decision-making research that\nrequires human data, high-quality datasets serve as important benchmarks to\nfacilitate the development of new methods by providing a common reproducible\nstandard. Many human decision-making tasks require visual attention to obtain\nhigh levels of performance.

Here, we provide a large-scale, high-quality dataset of\nhuman actions with simultaneously recorded eye movements while humans play\nAtari video games.

The model is very flexible, with\nmultiple linear regression and covariance selection models being special cases.\nHowever, its practical deployment in genomic data analysis under a Bayesian\nframework is limited due to both statistical and computational challenges. The\nstatistical challenge is that one needs to infer both the mean vector and the\ninverse covariance matrix, a problem inherently more complex than separately\nestimating each.

The proposed controller receives the current state measurement as\nan input and computes a sub-optimal control reaction by evaluating a finite\nnumber of piecewise affine functions that correspond to the explicit solution\nmaps of small-scale parametric quadratic programming (QP) problems. We provide\nrecursive feasibility and asymptotic stability guarantees, which can both be\nverified offline. The feedback controller is suboptimal on purpose because we\nare enforcing real-time requirements assuming that it is impossible to solve\nthe given large-scale QP in the given amount of time. In this context, a key\ncontribution of this paper is that we provide a bound on the sub-optimality of\nthe controller. Our numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed explicit\nreal-time scheme easily scales up to systems with hundreds of states and long\ncontrol horizons, system sizes that are completely out of the scope of\nexisting, non-suboptimal Explicit MPC controllers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 20:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

The occultation appears in two consecutive\n10-minute spectral images obtained by Alice, Rosetta's ultraviolet (700-2100 A)\nspectrograph, both of which show H2O absorption with column density $>10^{17.5}\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and significant O2 absorption ($\\mathrm{O2/H2O} \\approx\n5$-10%). Because the projected distance from the star to the nucleus changes\nbetween exposures, our ability to study the H2O column density profile near the\nnucleus (impact parameters $<1$ km) is unmatched by our previous observations.\nWe find that the H2O and O2 column densities decrease with increasing impact\nparameter, in accordance with expectations, but the O2 column decreases $\\sim3$\ntimes more quickly than H2O.

We conduct a thorough intercomparison survey with several\nestablished forward models, including COOLTLUSTY, PHOENIX, and find\nsatisfactory consistency with their results. Then, we explore the impact of (i)\ndifferent groups of opacity sources, (ii) a stellar path length adjustment, and\n(iii) a scattering correction on self-consistently calculated atmospheric\ntemperatures and planetary emission spectra. First, we observe that\ntemperature-pressure (T-P) profiles are very sensitive to the opacities\nincluded, with metal oxides, hydrides, the alkali atoms (and ionized hydrogen)\nplaying an important role for the absorption of shortwave radiation (in very\nhot surroundings). Moreover, if these species are sufficiently abundant, they\nare likely to induce non-monotonic T-P profiles. Second, without the stellar\npath length adjustment, the incoming stellar flux is significantly\nunderestimated for zenith angles above 80{\\deg}, which somewhat affects the\nupper atmospheric temperatures and the planetary emission. Third, the\nscattering correction improves the accuracy of the computation of the reflected\nstellar light by ~10%. We use HELIOS to calculate a grid of cloud-free\natmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium for self-luminous planets for a\nrange of effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and C/O\nratios, to be used by planetary evolution studies. Furthermore, we calculate\ndayside temperatures and secondary eclipse spectra for a sample of exoplanets\nfor varying chemistry and heat redistribution.

The historical auroral records\nhave been examined critically. Of particular interest was the \"white vapour\"\nobserved in China on AD 776 January 12/13. Both Usoskin et al. (2013, Astron.\nAstrophys. 55, L3; U13) and Stephenson (2015, Adv. Sp. Res. 55, 1537; S15)\ninterpreted this record as an auroral display. Subsequently, Neuh\\\"auser and\nNeuh\\\"auser (2015, Astron. Nachr. 336, 225; NN15) proposed five \"criteria\" for\nthe likeliness of aurorae and on this basis rejected an auroral interpretation.\nInstead, they interpreted it as a lunar halo, and suggested there were no\nauroral records as a proxy of solar activity in the interval AD 774-785. We\nconsider if their \"lunar halo hypothesis\" and their auroral criteria could be\nof use in future researches on historical auroral candidates. We first show a\ncounter-example for the lunar halo hypothesis from a parallel record on 1882\nNovember 17, which was seen as a whitish colour, in the southerly direction,\nand near the Moon. We then consider NN15's criteria on colour, direction, and\nsky brightness and investigate other counter-examples from early-modern auroral\nobservations. We also consider the extension of the white vapour in AD 776\naccording to the distribution of Chinese asterisms, and show that its large\nextension was inconsistent with the lunar halo hypothesis. Conversely, the\nstreaks of white vapour penetrating the eight Chinese asterisms can be\nreproduced if we consider auroral-ray structures at altitudes between 97 km and\n170 km, along geomagnetic field lines between the L-shells L=1.55 and 1.64.

This scenario would lead to a\nrich multi-wavelength emission that can, in turn, be used to test it.\nRelativistic cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) in magnetic fields produce radio\nemission through synchrotron radiation, while X-rays and gamma rays are\nproduced through inverse Compton scattering. Additionally, collisions of\nprimary cosmic-ray protons (CRp) in the interstellar medium produce charged and\nneutral pions that then decay into secondary CRe (detectable through radiative\nprocesses) and gamma-rays.

We find that the multi-component\nmodel is the most promising, and is able to fit the multi-wavelength spectrum\nfor a variety of astrophysical parameters consistent with previous studies of\nM31 and of cosmic-ray physics. However, the CR power injection implied by our\nmodels exceeds the estimated CR power injection from typical astrophysical\ncosmic-ray sources such as supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 22:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 19:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

In order\nto grow BHs with $M_{\\rm BH} > 10^9$ M$_{\\odot}$ by less than a billion years\nafter the Big Bang, mass accretion onto the low-mass seed BHs needs to have\nbeen very rapid (Volonteri & Rees, 2005).

This is the point\nat which the outward force produced by radiation pressure is equal to the\ngravitational attraction experienced by the in-falling matter. In principle,\nthis implies that there is a maximum luminosity an object of mass $M$ can emit;\nassuming spherical accretion and that the opacity is dominated by Thompson\nscattering, this Eddington luminosity is $L_{\\rm{E}} = 1.38 \\times 10^{38}\n(M/M_{\\odot})$ erg s$^{-1}$.

In many situations, these hypotheses may have an underlying tree\nstructure that not only helps determine the order that tests should be\nconducted but also imposes a dependency between tests that must be accounted\nfor. Our motivating example comes from testing the association between a trait\nof interest and groups of microbes that have been organized into operational\ntaxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Given p-values\nfrom association tests for each individual OTU or ASV, we would like to know if\nwe can declare that a certain species, genus, or higher taxonomic grouping can\nbe considered to be associated with the trait. For this problem, a bottom-up\ntesting algorithm that starts at the lowest level of the tree (OTUs or ASVs)\nand proceeds upward through successively higher taxonomic groupings (species,\ngenus, family etc.) is required. We develop such a bottom-up testing algorithm\nthat controls the error rate of decisions made at higher levels in the tree,\nconditional on findings at lower levels in the tree. We further show this\nalgorithm controls the false discovery rate based on the global null hypothesis\nthat no taxa are associated with the trait. By simulation, we also show that\nour approach is better at finding driver taxa, the highest level taxa below\nwhich there are dense association signals. We illustrate our approach using\ndata from a study of the microbiome among patients with ulcerative colitis and\nhealthy controls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 00:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

As space missions provide an emerging picture of formation\nand evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomes\none of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge,\nwe need to specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and\nsustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding of global\n(astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments of\nexoplanets in the framework of the physical processes of the interaction\nbetween evolving planet-hosting stars along with exoplanetary evolution over\ngeological timescales, and the resulting impact on climate and habitability of\nexoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical atmospheric and\ngeological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studies\nwith the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary,\nEarth sciences, astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. The\nassessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of\nterrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may significantly\nmodify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide new\ndirections for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization of\nstellar ionizing outputs becomes an important task for further understanding\nthe extent of habitability in the universe.

In broadcast basketball videos, specific\ncamera motions are used to present specific events. Therefore, a semantic event\nin broadcast basketball videos is closely related to both the global motion\n(camera motion) and the collective motion. A semantic event in basketball\nvideos can be generally divided into three stages: pre-event, event occurrence\n(event-occ), and post-event. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based global\nand collective motion pattern (On_GCMP) algorithm for basketball event\nclassification. First, a two-stage GCMP based event classification scheme is\nproposed. The GCMP is extracted using optical flow. The two-stage scheme\nprogressively combines a five-class event classification algorithm on\nevent-occs and a two-class event classification algorithm on pre-events. Both\nalgorithms utilize sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the spatial and temporal features\nof GCMP for event classification. Second, we utilize post-event segments to\npredict success/failure using deep features of images in the video frames\n(RGB_DF_VF) based algorithms. Finally the event classification results and\nsuccess/failure classification results are integrated to obtain the final\nresults. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we collected a new dataset called\nNCAA+, which is automatically obtained from the NCAA dataset by extending the\nfixed length of video clips forward and backward of the corresponding semantic\nevents.

Simple\nasymptotic expressions of the average peak AoI are also derived when the PIoT\noperates at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Based on the asymptotic\nexpressions, we characterize a critical generation rate of the PIoT system,\nwhich can determine the superiority of overlay and underlay schemes in terms of\nthe average peak AoI of the SIoT. Numerical results validate the theoretical\nanalysis and uncover that the overlay and underlay schemes can outperform each\nother in terms of the average peak AoI of the SIoT for different system setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 06:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 07:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

They are coupled along an artificial level below\nwhich the Dupuit hypothesis holds true (i.e. the vertical flow is\ninstantaneous) in a way ensuring that the global model is mass conservative.\nTuning the artificial level, which even can depend on an unknown of the\nproblem, we browse the new class of models. We prove using asymptotic\nexpansions that the 3D-Richards problem and each model of the class behaves the\nsame at every considered time scale (short, intermediate and large) in thin\naquifers. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations, showing\nespecially that the new models results fit well with the ones obtained with the\noriginal 3d-Richards problem even in non-thin aquifers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 10:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Therefore, almost every\nplanetary system should have leftover remnants as a result of planetary\nformation in form of comets at the edges of those systems.

This limitation stems from the fact that\nexisting CNNs operate on deterministic numbers. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel statistical convolutional neural network (SCNN), which extends existing\nCNN architectures but operates directly on correlated distributions rather than\ndeterministic numbers. By introducing a parameterized canonical model to model\ncorrelated data and defining corresponding operations as required for CNN\ntraining and inference, we show that SCNN can process multiple frames of\ncorrelated images effectively, hence achieving significant speedup over\nexisting CNN models. We use a CNN based video object detection as an example to\nillustrate the usefulness of the proposed SCNN as a general network model.\nExperimental results show that even a non-optimized implementation of SCNN can\nstill achieve 178% speedup over existing CNNs with slight accuracy degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 16:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

The primary focus is on the physical and mathematical\nconcepts underlying different (turbulent) branches of dynamo theory, with some\nastrophysical, geophysical and experimental context disseminated throughout the\ndocument. The text begins with an introduction to the rationale, observational\nand historical roots of the subject, and to the basic concepts of\nmagnetohydrodynamics relevant to dynamo theory. The next two sections discuss\nthe fundamental phenomenological and mathematical aspects of (linear and\nnonlinear) small- and large-scale MHD dynamos. These sections are complemented\nby an overview of a selection of current active research topics in the field,\nincluding the numerical modelling of the geo- and solar dynamos, shear dynamos\ndriven by turbulence with zero net helicity, and MHD-instability-driven dynamos\nsuch as the magnetorotational dynamo. The difficult problem of a unified,\nself-consistent statistical treatment of small and large-scale dynamos at large\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers is also discussed throughout the text.
