Nevertheless, it still faces a harsh trade-off among the\nacquisition time, the spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio. Here we\npresent a new compressive imaging approach with use of a strategy called\ncake-cutting which optimally reorders the deterministic Hadamard basis. By this\nmeans, the number of measurements can be dramatically reduced by more than two\norders of magnitude. Furthermore, by exploiting the structured characteristic\nof the Hadamard matrix, we can accelerate the computational process and\nsimultaneously reduce the memory consumption of storing the matrix. The\nproposed method is capable of recovering an image of the object, of pixel size\n$1024\\times1024$, with a sampling ratio of even 0.2%, thereby realizing super\nsub-Nyquist sampling and significantly reducing the acquisition time. Moreover,\nthrough the differential modulation/measurements, we demonstrate this method\nwith a single-photon single-pixel camera under low light condition and retrieve\nclear images through partially obscuring scenes. This described practical\nmethod complements the single-pixel imaging approaches and can be applied to a\nvariety of fields, such as video, night vision goggles and automatic drive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In addition to numerous living and artificial\nactive microswimmers, a passive microswimmer was identified only recently: a\nsoft, Lambda-shaped, non-buoyant particle propagates in a shaken liquid of\nzero-mean velocity [Jo et al. Phys. Rev. E 94, 063116 (2016)]. We show that\nthis novel passive locomotion mechanism works for realistic non-buoyant,\nasymmetric Janus microcapsules as well. According to our analytical\napproximation, this locomotion requires a symmetry breaking caused by different\nStokes drags of soft particles during the two half periods of the oscillatory\nliquid motion. It is the intrinsic anisotropy of Janus capsules and\nLambda-shaped particles that break this symmetry for sinusoidal liquid motion.\nFurther, we show that this passive locomotion mechanism also works for the\nwider class of symmetric soft particles, e.g., capsules, by breaking the\nsymmetry via an appropriate liquid shaking. The swimming direction can be\nuniquely selected by a suitable choice of the liquid motion. Numerical studies,\nincluding lattice Boltzmann simulations, also show that this locomotion can\noutweigh gravity, i.e., non-buoyant particles may be either elevated in shaken\nliquids or concentrated at the bottom of a container. This novel propulsion\nmechanism is relevant to many applications, including the sorting of soft\nparticles like healthy and malignant (cancer) cells, which serves medical\npurposes, or the use of non-buoyant soft particles as directed microswimmers .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 11:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

For 1690 stars, TESS has the sensitivity to detect\nplanets down to 1.6 times Earth-size, a commonly used limit for rocky planets\nin the literature, receiving Earth-analog irradiation. We select stars from the\nTESS Candidate Target List, based on TESS Input Catalog Version 7. We update\ntheir distances using Gaia Data Release 2, and determine whether the stars will\nbe observed for long enough during the 2 year prime mission to probe their\nEarth equivalent orbital distance for transiting planets.

In the continuum approximation the former\ncorresponds to the spacetime causality relation and the latter to a fundamental\nspacetime atomicity, so that finite volume regions in the continuum contain\nonly a finite number of causal set elements. CST is deeply rooted in the\nLorentzian character of spacetime, where a primary role is played by the causal\nstructure poset.

Common approaches operate either by reducing the\nproblem to the still images case, facing a significant information loss, or by\nexploiting inter-sequence temporal dependencies as in Siamese Recurrent Neural\nNetworks or in gait analysis. However, in all cases, the inter-sequences\npose/viewpoint misalignment is not considered, and the existing spatial\napproaches are mostly limited to the still images context. To this end, we\npropose a novel approach that can exploit more effectively the rich video\ninformation, by accounting for the role that the changing pose/viewpoint factor\nplays in the sequences matching process. Specifically, our approach consists of\ntwo components. The first one attempts to complement the original\npose-incomplete information carried by the sequences with synthetic\nGAN-generated images, and fuse their feature vectors into a more discriminative\nviewpoint-insensitive embedding, namely Weighted Fusion (WF). Another one\nperforms an explicit pose-based alignment of sequence pairs to promote coherent\nfeature matching, namely Weighted-Pose Regulation (WPR).

This is now strongly supported by experiment, which\nfurthermore reveals dramatic correlation effects in the magic range due to the\nrelative dominance of interactions when the bandwidth is suppressed.\nExperimentally, quantum oscillations exhibit different Landau level\ndegeneracies when the angles fall in or outside the magic range; these\nobservations can contain crucial information about the low energy physics. In\nthis paper, we report a thorough theoretical study of the Landau level\nstructure of the non-interacting continuum model for twisted bilayer graphene\nas the magnetic field and the twist angle are tuned. We first show that a\ndiscernible difference exists in the butterfly spectra when twist angle falls\nin and outside the magic range. Next, we carry out semiclassical analysis in\ndetail, which quantitatively determines the origin of the low energy Landau\nlevels from the zero field band structure. We find that the Landau level\ndegeneracy predicted in the above analyses is capable of partially explaining\nfeatures of the quantum oscillation experiments in a natural way.

Several other variants of $D$,\nincluding directed/multiplicative/$q$- versions were studied, and always,\ndet$(D)$ depends only on the edge-data.\n  We introduce a general framework for bi-directed weighted trees, with\nthreefold significance. First, we improve on state-of-the-art for all known\nvariants, even in the classical Graham-Pollak case: we delete arbitrary pendant\nnodes (and more general subsets) from the rows/columns of $D$, and show these\nminors do not depend on the tree-structure.\n  Second, our setting unifies all known variants (with entries in a commutative\nring). We further compute in closed form the inverse of $D$, extending a result\nof Graham-Lovasz [Adv. Math. 1978] and answering a question of Bapat-Lal-Pati\n[Lin. Alg. Appl. 2006].\n  Third, we compute a second function of the matrix $D$: the sum of all its\ncofactors, cof$(D)$. This was worked out in the simplest setting by\nGraham-Hoffman-Hosoya (1978), but is relatively unexplored for other variants.\nWe prove a stronger result, in our general setting, by computing cof$(.)$ for\nminors as above, and showing these too depend only on the edge-data.\n  Finally, we show our setting is the 'most general possible', in that with\nmore freedom in the edgeweights, det$(D)$ and cof$(D)$ depend on the tree\nstructure. In a sense, this completes the study of the invariant det$(D_T)$\n(and cof$(D_T)$) for trees $T$ with edge-data in a commutative ring.\n  Moreover: for a bi-directed graph $G$ we prove multiplicative\nGraham-Hoffman-Hosoya type formulas for det$(D_G)$, cof$(D_G)$, $D_G^{-1}$.

We explore two\nnew avenues for thermal inversions in hot Jupiters, exploring both the visible\nand infrared opacities in their atmospheres. Firstly, by exploring a range of\nmetal-rich species we find that four species (AlO, CaO, NaH and MgH) provide\nvisible opacities comparable to TiO/VO and can cause strong inversions with\nreasonable abundances. Secondly, we show that a low infrared opacity caused by\na low H$_2$O abundance, e.g. through a C/O~1, can also lead to strong thermal\ninversions even with low abundances of the visible absorbers mentioned above.\nWe find that increasing the C/O ratio towards unity requires almost 2 orders of\nmagnitude lower abundances for the visible absorbers in order for an inversion\nto form.

Although the exact shape of the DTD cannot be determined with the\nexisting data, in all models that adequately describe the data we find at least\n$40\\%$ of BNSs with merger times less than 1Gyr. This population of rapid\nmergers implies a declining deposition rate of $r$-process materials that is\nconsistent with several independent observations of heavy element abundances in\nthe Milky Way. At the same time this population that requires initial binary\nseparations of roughly one solar radius clearly indicates that these binaries\nhad common envelope progenitors. Our results suggest that a significant\nfraction of future LIGO/Virgo BNS mergers would reside in star forming\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 16:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

Nowadays, with deep networks prevailing throughout machine\nlearning, there are revamped interests in pushing facial landmark detection\ntechnologies to handle more challenging data. Most efforts use network\nobjectives based on L1 or L2 norms, which have several disadvantages. First of\nall, the locations of landmarks are determined from generated heatmaps (i.e.,\nconfidence maps) from which predicted landmark locations (i.e., the means) get\npenalized without accounting for the spread: a high scatter corresponds to low\nconfidence and vice-versa. For this, we introduce a LaplaceKL objective that\npenalizes for a low confidence. Another issue is a dependency on labeled data,\nwhich are expensive to obtain and susceptible to error. To address both issues\nwe propose an adversarial training framework that leverages unlabeled data to\nimprove model performance. Our method claims state-of-the-art on all of the\n300W benchmarks and ranks second-to-best on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in\nthe Wild (AFLW) dataset.

Users with different AoDs and comparable channel gains\nare served via RAMA while users with the same AoDs but different channel gains\nare served via NOMA. This technique results in the independence of the number\nof radio frequency chains from the number of NOMA groups. Further, we derive\nthe feasibility conditions and show that the power allocation for RA-NOMA is a\nconvex problem. We then derive the maximum achievable sum-rate of RA-NOMA.\nSimulation results show that RA-NOMA outperforms conventional orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA) as well as the combination of RAMA with the OMA\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

The nodes are interconnected by a network represented as an undirected\ngraph, and the system is assumed to be synchronous. Under the classical\npoint-to-point communication model, it is well-known [7] that the following two\nconditions are both necessary and sufficient to achieve Byzantine consensus\namong $n$ nodes in the presence of up to $f$ Byzantine faulty nodes: $n \\ge\n3f+1$ and vertex connectivity at least $2f+1$. In the classical point-to-point\ncommunication model, it is possible for a faulty node to equivocate, i.e.,\ntransmit conflicting information to different neighbors. Such equivocation is\npossible because messages sent by a node to one of its neighbors are not\noverheard by other neighbors.\n  This paper considers the local broadcast model. In contrast to the\npoint-to-point communication model, in the local broadcast model, messages sent\nby a node are received identically by all of its neighbors. Thus, under the\nlocal broadcast model, attempts by a node to send conflicting information can\nbe detected by its neighbors. Under this model, we show that the following two\nconditions are both necessary and sufficient for Byzantine consensus: vertex\nconnectivity at least $\\lfloor 3f/2 \\rfloor + 1$ and minimum node degree at\nleast $2f$. Observe that the local broadcast model results in a lower\nrequirement for connectivity and the number of nodes $n$, as compared to the\npoint-to-point communication model.\n  We extend the above results to a hybrid model that allows some of the\nByzantine faulty nodes to equivocate. The hybrid model bridges the gap between\nthe point-to-point and local broadcast models, and helps to precisely\ncharacterize the trade-off between equivocation and network requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 20:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few\niterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization\ngradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy\nlabels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather\nfar from from the initialization which can only occur after many more\niterations.

Because of this susceptibility,\nthe deep learning models deployed to power a network defense could in fact be\nthe weakest entry point for compromising a network system. In this paper, we\nshow that by modifying on average as little as 1.38 of the input features, an\nadversary can generate malicious inputs which effectively fool a deep learning\nbased NIDS. Therefore, when designing such systems, it is crucial to consider\nthe performance from not only the conventional network security perspective but\nalso the adversarial machine learning domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 20:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 02:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Results show that\ntheir performance is usually maximized in a narrow region of hyper-parameter\nspace called edge of chaos. Finding such a region requires searching in\nhyper-parameter space in a sensible way: hyper-parameter configurations\nmarginally outside such a region might yield networks exhibiting fully\ndeveloped chaos, hence producing unreliable computations. The performance gain\ndue to optimizing hyper-parameters can be studied by considering the\nmemory--nonlinearity trade-off, i.e., the fact that increasing the nonlinear\nbehavior of the network degrades its ability to remember past inputs, and\nvice-versa. In this paper, we propose a model of ESNs that eliminates critical\ndependence on hyper-parameters, resulting in networks that provably cannot\nenter a chaotic regime and, at the same time, denotes nonlinear behaviour in\nphase space characterised by a large memory of past inputs, comparable to the\none of linear networks.

In\nparticular, using information on the minimum paths in water distribution\nnetworks (WDNs) allows to track the diffusion of contaminants and to quantify\nthe resilience and criticality of the system. This is, ultimately, approached\nby considering dynamically changing path-weights that depend on the flow or on\nother information available at run-time. These analyses tipically include all\nthe WDN assets but reducing the high degree of physical details with a minimum\nlost of key information for their performance assessment. This paper proposes a\nstrategy to compute minimum paths that is based on a dimensionality-reduction\nprocess. Specifically, the network is partitioned into communities and suitably\nmodified to obtain a reduced complexity representation (e.g., in terms of\nnumber of nodes and links). The paper shows how this novel, reduced\nrepresentation is equivalent to the traditional network on computing the\nshortest paths. The proposed approach is validated considering two utility\nnetworks as case studies. The results show that the proposed method provides\nthe exact solution for the shortest path with a computational-time reduction\nconsistently over 50\\% and up to 90\\% for some cases. Furthermore, the\napplication of the proposal on WDNs partitioning shows both hydraulic and\neconomic advantages thanks to their monitoring and controlling at near\nreal-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 10:19:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 19:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

It is in direct\ncontrast to the conventional view that breaking TRS of a 2D/3D TI leads to a\nChern insulator exhibiting quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on a\ntight-binding model of pyrochlore lattice, we show that this unusual\n3D-FB-enabled Weyl state may contain only a minimum of two Weyl points.\nFurthermore, using first-principles calculations, we identify this Weyl state\nin a real material Sn$_2$Nb$_2$O$_7$. The main features of the resulting Weyl\npoints are analyzed with respect to symmetry, topological invariant and surface\nstate. Our finding sheds new light on our fundamental understanding of\ntopological physics and significantly extends the scope of Weyl semimetals to\nattract immediate experimental interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 21:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

However, it is\ncomputationally difficult to compute the fully PPR, especially on large graphs,\nnot to mention that most existing approaches do not consider the weights of\nedges. In particular, the existing approach cannot handle graphs with billion\nedges on a moderate-size cluster. To address this problem, this paper presents\na novel study on the computation of fully edge-weighted PPR on large graphs\nusing the distributed computing framework. Specifically, we employ the Monte\nCarlo approximation that performs a large number of random walks from each node\nof the graph, and exploits the parallel pipeline framework to reduce the\noverall running time of the fully PPR. Based on that, we develop several\noptimization techniques which (i) alleviate the issue of large nodes that could\nexplode the memory space, (ii) pre-compute short walks for small nodes that\nlargely speedup the computation of random walks, and (iii) optimize the amount\nof random walks to compute in each pipeline that significantly reduces the\noverhead.

After the Peccei-Quinn\nsymmetry breaking, axion strings are formed and attached by domain walls when\nthe temperature of the universe becomes comparable to the QCD scale.

As a solution\nfor it, the Lazarides-Shafi mechanism is often discussed through introduction\nof a new non-Abelian (gauge) symmetry. We study this mechanism in detail and\nshow configuration of strings and walls. Even if Abelian axion strings with a\ndomain wall number greater than one are formed in the early universe, each of\nthem is split into multiple Alice axion strings due to a repulsive force\nbetween the Alice strings even without domain wall. When domain walls are\nformed as the universe cools down, a single Alice string can be attached by a\nsingle wall because a vacuum is connected by a non-Abelian rotation without\nchanging energy. Even if an Abelian axion string attached by domain walls are\ncreated due to the Kibble Zurek mechanism at the chiral phase transition, such\nstrings are also similarly split into multiple Alice strings attached by walls\nin the presence of the domain wall tension. Such walls do not form stable\nnetworks since they collapse by the tension of the walls, emitting axions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 01:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Symbolic states, which consist\nof path conditions and constraints on local variables, are a compact\ndescription of sets of concrete program states and they can be used for both\ninvariant inference and invariant verification. Our technique uses a\ncounterexample-based algorithm that creates concrete states from symbolic\nstates, infers candidate invariants from concrete states, and then verifies or\nrefutes candidate invariants using symbolic states. The refutation case\nproduces concrete counterexamples that prevent spurious results and allow the\ntechnique to obtain more precise invariants. This process stops when the\nalgorithm reaches a stable set of invariants.\n  We present SymInfer, a tool that implements these ideas to automatically\ngenerate invariants at arbitrary locations in a Java program. The tool obtains\nsymbolic states from Symbolic PathFinder and uses existing algorithms to infer\ncomplex (potentially nonlinear) numerical invariants. Our preliminary results\nshow that SymInfer is effective in using symbolic states to generate precise\nand useful invariants for proving program safety and analyzing program runtime\ncomplexity.

However, such approaches are fundamentally limited\nsince a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size\nexponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these\napproaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video\nunderstanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are\nprone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the\nrelevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that\nare not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate\nthat mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to\nlearn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To\nmitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which\nlearns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead\nof the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a\npractical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed\nusing Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves\nsubstantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a\nmajor challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 03:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

This is\nmotivated by models for bacterial dormancy, where periods of quiescence can be\norders of magnitude larger than reproductive times, and where it is expected to\nfind non-trivial degenerate genealogies on the evolutionary time-scale.\n  However, the above scaling regime is not only interesting from a biological\nperspective, but also from a mathematical point of view, since it provides a\nprototypical example where the expected scaling limit of a continuous diffusion\nshould (and will be) a jump-diffusion.

We formulate an\noptimal stopping model in which the decision to cover a short position is\naffected by two short sale-specific frictions---margin risk and recall risk.\nMargin risk refers to the fact that short sales are collateralised\ntransactions, which means that short sellers may be forced to close out their\npositions involuntarily if they cannot fund margin calls.

Because more than one model is able to describe these features,\nthe explanation of where and how the red-skewed Fe lines are produced is still\na matter of discussion. It is broadly accepted that the shape of the Fe Kalpha\nline is strongly determined by the special and general relativistic effects\noccurring in the innermost part of the accretion disk. In this relativistic\nframework, the Fe fluorescent lines are produced in the innermost part of the\naccretion disk by reflection of hard X-ray photons coming from the central\nsource (corona and/or NS surface). We developed an alternative and\nnonrelativistic model, called the windline model, that is capable to describe\nthe Fe line features. In this nonrelativistic framework, the line photons are\nproduced at the bottom of a partly ionized outflow (wind) shell as a result of\nillumination by the continuum photons coming from the central source, and the\nred-skewness of the line profile is explained by repeated electron scattering\nof the photons in a diverging outflow. Because GX~13+1 is a well-known\ndisk-wind source, it is a perfect target for testing the windline model and\ncomparing it to the relativistic one. In order to access the goodness of the\nfit and distinguish between the two line models, we used the run-test\nstatistical method in addition to the canonical $\\chi^2$ statistical method.\nThe diskline and windline models both fit the asymmetric GX13+1 Fe line well.\nFrom a statistical point of view, for the two observations we analyzed, the\nrun-test was not able to distinguish between the two Fe line models, at 5%\nsignificance level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 07:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

It is a well\nresearched problem with extensive commercial applications such as digital\ncamera, video compression, medical imaging and so on. Most super resolution\nworks focus on the features learning architecture, which can recover the\ntexture details as close as possible. However, these works suffer from the\nfollowing challenges: (1) The low-resolution (LR) training images are\nartificially synthesized using HR images with bicubic downsampling, which have\nmuch richer-information than real demosaic-upscaled mobile images. The mismatch\nbetween training and inference mobile data heavily blocks the improvement of\npractical super resolution algorithms. (2) These methods cannot effectively\nhandle the blind distortions during super resolution in practical applications.\nIn this work, an end-to-end novel framework, including high-to-low network and\nlow-to-high network, is proposed to solve the above problems with dual\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN). First, the above mismatch problems are\nwell explored with the high-to-low network, where clear high-resolution image\nand the corresponding realistic low-resolution image pairs can be generated.\nMoreover, a large-scale General Mobile Super Resolution Dataset, GMSR, is\nproposed, which can be utilized for training or as a fair comparison benchmark\nfor super resolution methods. Second, an effective low-to-high network (super\nresolution network) is proposed in the framework. Benefiting from the GMSR\ndataset and novel training strategies, the super resolution model can\neffectively handle detail recovery and denoising at the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 07:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

These second order fluctuations generically\nproduce a minimum amount of tensor perturbations corresponding to a\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\\sim 10^{-6}$. Inverting this relationship yields a\nbound on the tensor tilt sourced by scalar fluctuations. Since this induced GW\nspectrum depends on the scalar spectrum, we derive a new indirect bound that\ninvolves \\textit{all scales} of the scalar spectrum based on CMB observations.\nThis bound comes from the constraint on the number of effective relativistic\ndegrees of freedom, $N_{eff}$.

It is well-known\nthat objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of\ndetailed information during network forward pass (e.g., RoI operation). We thus\nregard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low\nresolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is designed\nto minimize the distribution divergence between two sets. The choice of\ngenerating an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further\ninvestigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) theory into the\nframework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with aid of OT\nmetric. Incorporated with such a plug-and-play intertwiner, we achieve an\nevident improvement over previous state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 09:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

A novel wave-particle adaptive formulation is introduced in\nthe UGKWP method to describe the flow dynamics in each control volume. The\nlocal gas evolution is constructed through the dynamical interaction of the\ndeterministic hydrodynamic wave and the stochastic kinetic particle. Within the\nresolution of cell size and time step, the decomposition, interaction, and\nevolution of the hydrodynamic wave and the kinetic particle depend on the ratio\nof the time step to the local particle collision time. In the rarefied flow\nregime, the flow physics is mainly recovered by the discrete particles and the\nUGKWP method performs as a stochastic particle method. In the continuum flow\nregime, the flow behavior is solely followed by macroscopic variable evolution\nand the UGKWP method becomes a gas-kinetic hydrodynamic flow solver for the\nviscous and heat-conducting Navier--Stokes solutions. In different flow\nregimes, many numerical test cases are computed to validate the UGKWP method on\nunstructured mesh. The UGKWP method can get the same UGKS solutions in all\nKnudsen regimes without the requirement of the time step and mesh size being\nless than than the particle collision time and mean free path. With an\nautomatic wave-particle decomposition, the UGKWP method becomes very efficient.\nFor example, at Mach number 30 and Knudsen number 0.1, in comparison with UGKS\nseveral-order-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost and memory\nrequirement have been achieved by UGKWP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 09:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

In addition, earlier ALMA observations of the emission\nof three molecular lines, CO(2-1), C18O(2-1), and DCO+(3-2), having a\nresolution of ~70 au, are used to demonstrate the Keplerian motion of the gas,\nfound consistent with a central mass of 2.3 solar masses. An upper limit of ~9%\nof the rotation velocity is placed on the in-fall velocity. The beam size is\nshown to give the dominant contribution to the line widths, accounting for both\ntheir absolute values and their dependence on the distance to the central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 09:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 20:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}

This situation is opposite to that in a normal dynamo,\nwhere the flow does work against the Lorentz force. We compute the spectral\nconversion rates between kinetic and magnetic energies for several magnetic\nPrandtl numbers and show that normal (forward) dynamo action occurs on large\nscales over a progressively narrower range of wavenumbers as the magnetic\nPrandtl number is increased. At higher wavenumbers, reversed dynamo action\noccurs, i.e., magnetic energy is converted back into kinetic energy at small\nscales. We demonstrate this in both direct numerical simulations forced by\nvolume stirring and in large eddy simulations of solar convectively driven\nsmall-scale dynamos. Low density plasmas such as stellar coronae tend to have\nlarge magnetic Prandtl numbers, i.e., the viscosity is large compared with the\nmagnetic diffusivity. The regime in which viscous dissipation dominates over\nresistive dissipation for large magnetic Prandtl numbers was also previously\nfound in large eddy simulations of the solar corona, i.e., our findings are a\nmore fundamental property of MHD that is not just restricted to dynamos.\nViscous energy dissipation is a consequence of positive Lorentz force work,\nwhich may partly correspond to particle acceleration in close-to-collisionless\nplasmas.

We demonstrate the technique on HR8799, a young planetary system\ncomposed of four known giant exoplanets. We used the GRAVITY fringe tracker to\nlock the fringes on the central star, and integrated off-axis on the HR8799e\nplanet situated at 390 mas from the star. Data reduction included\npost-processing to remove the flux leaking from the central star and to extract\nthe coherent flux of the planet. The inferred K band spectrum of the planet has\na spectral resolution of 500. We also derive the astrometric position of the\nplanet relative to the star with a precision on the order of 100$\\,\\mu$as. The\nGRAVITY astrometric measurement disfavors perfectly coplanar stable orbital\nsolutions. A small adjustment of a few degrees to the orbital inclination of HR\n8799 e can resolve the tension, implying that the orbits are close to, but not\nstrictly coplanar.

The volume-penalty method is a kind of\nfictitious-domain method that approximates no-slip boundary conditions with\nrapid linear damping inside the object. The method can then simulate complex,\nmoving objects in general numerical solvers without specialised algorithms or\nboundary-conforming grids. Volume penalisation pays for this simplicity by\nintroducing an equation-level error, the $\\textit{model error}$, that is\nrelated to the damping time $\\eta \\ll 1$.

Here we present radio galaxy classification based on a 13-layer\nDeep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) using transfer learning methods\nbetween different radio surveys. We find that our machine learning models\ntrained from a random initialization achieve accuracies comparable to those\nfound elsewhere in the literature. When using transfer learning methods, we\nfind that inheriting model weights pre-trained on FIRST images can boost model\nperformance when re-training on lower resolution NVSS data, but that inheriting\npre-trained model weights from NVSS and re-training on FIRST data impairs the\nperformance of the classifier. We consider the implication of these results in\nthe context of future radio surveys planned for next-generation radio\ntelescopes such as ASKAP, MeerKAT, and SKA1-MID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 12:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

More specific possible\ncarriers among PAHs are investigated, namely elongated molecules, which could\nexplain a correlation between the DIB wavelength and the apparent UV resilience\nof their carriers. We address the case of polyacenes, C4N+2-H2N+4, with N~10-18\nfused rectilinear aligned hexagons. Polyacenes are attractive DIB carrier\ncandidates because their high symmetry and large linear size allow them to form\nregular series of bands in the visible range with strengths larger than most\nother PAHs, as confirmed by recent laboratory results up to undecacene\n(C46H26). Those with very strong bands in the DIB spectral domain are just at\nthe limit of stability against UV photodissociation. They are part of the\nprominent PAH family of interstellar carbon compounds, meaning that only ~10-5\nof the total PAH abundance is enough to account for a medium-strength DIB.\nAfter summarizing the current knowledge about the properties of polyacenes and\nrecent laboratory results, the likelihood that they might meet the criteria for\nbeing carriers of some DIBs is addressed by reviewing the following properties:\nwavelength and strength of their series of visible bands; interstellar\nstability and abundances, charge state and hydrogenation; and DIB rotation\nprofiles. No definite inconsistency has been identified that precludes\npolyacenes from being the carriers of some DIBs with medium or weak strength,\nincluding the so-called C2 DIBs.

However, due to the difficulties of\ncontrolling structures and textures, it is challenging to model poses and\nexpressions simultaneously, especially for the extreme manipulation at\nhigh-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simplifies\nface manipulation into two correlated stages: a boundary prediction stage and a\ndisentangled face synthesis stage. The first stage models poses and expressions\njointly via boundary images. Specifically, a conditional encoder-decoder\nnetwork is employed to predict the boundary image of the target face in a\nsemi-supervised way. Pose and expression estimators are introduced to improve\nthe prediction performance. In the second stage, the predicted boundary image\nand the input face image are encoded into the structure and the texture latent\nspace by two encoder networks, respectively. A proxy network and a feature\nthreshold loss are further imposed to disentangle the latent space.\nFurthermore, due to the lack of high-resolution face manipulation databases to\nverify the effectiveness of our method, we collect a new high-quality\nMulti-View Face (MVF-HQ) database. It contains 120,283 images at 6000x4000\nresolution from 479 identities with diverse poses, expressions, and\nilluminations. MVF-HQ is much larger in scale and much higher in resolution\nthan publicly available high-resolution face manipulation databases.

To understand the global\nsuspension behavior we relate it to the filament microstructure, deformation\nand elastic energy and examine the stress budget to quantify the effect of the\nelastic contribution. At fixed volume fraction, the viscosity of the suspension\nreduces when decreasing the bending rigidity and grows when increasing the\nReynolds number. The change in the relative viscosity is stronger at finite\ninertia, although still in the laminar flow regime as considered here.\nMoreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive as in\npolymeric fluids, and to increase with the Reynolds number; its value has a\npeak for an intermediate value of the filament bending stiffness. The peak\nvalue is found to be proportional to the Reynolds number, moving towards more\nrigid suspensions at larger inertia. Moreover, the viscosity increases when\nincreasing the filament volume fraction, and the rate of increase of the\nfilament stress with the bending rigidity is stronger at higher Reynolds\nnumbers and reduces with the volume fraction.

On the theoretical side, the taxonomy of\nexplanations for the accelerated expansion rate is better understood, providing\nclear guidance to the relevant observables. We argue that: i) improving\nstatistical precision and systematic control by taking more data, supporting\nresearch efforts to address crucial challenges for each probe, using\ncomplementary methods, and relying on cross-correlations is well motivated; ii)\nblinding of analyses is difficult but ever more important; iii) studies of dark\nenergy and modified gravity are related; and iv) it is crucial that R&D for a\nvibrant dark energy program in the 2030s be started now by supporting studies\nand technical R&D that will allow embryonic proposals to mature.

To narrow\nthe spectrum, we propose a general approach on how to automatically expose\nsystematic differences between human and machine translations to human experts.\nInspired by adversarial settings, we train a neural text classifier to\ndistinguish human from machine translations. A classifier that performs and\ngeneralizes well after training should recognize systematic differences between\nthe two classes, which we uncover with neural explainability methods.

Existing studies only\nleverage network structure information and focus on preserving structural\nfeatures. However, nodes in real-world networks often have a rich set of\nattributes providing extra semantic information. It has been demonstrated that\nboth structural and attribute features are important for network analysis\ntasks. To preserve both features, we investigate the problem of integrating\nstructure and attribute information to perform network embedding and propose a\nMultimodal Deep Network Embedding (MDNE) method. MDNE captures the non-linear\nnetwork structures and the complex interactions among structures and\nattributes, using a deep model consisting of multiple layers of non-linear\nfunctions. Since structures and attributes are two different types of\ninformation, a multimodal learning method is adopted to pre-process them and\nhelp the model to better capture the correlations between node structure and\nattribute information. We employ both structural proximity and attribute\nproximity in the loss function to preserve the respective features and the\nrepresentations are obtained by minimizing the loss function.

Therefore only evaluating accuracy is not sufficient for\nmeasuring the performance of captioning models --- the diversity of the\ngenerated captions should also be considered.

In the ferromagnetic state, the resistivity shows a $T^2$\ntemperature dependence possibly due to electron-magnon scattering and above the\nCurie temperature $T_c$, the dependence changes to $T^{3/2}$ behaviour\nindicating a correlation between transport and magnetic properties. In this\npaper, we show that the transport spin-polarization in EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$,\na low Curie temperature ferromagnet, is as high ($\\sim 40\\%$) as that in some\nof the metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures. In addition, owing\nto the low Curie temperature of EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$, the temperature ($T$)\ndependence of $P_t$ could be measured systematically up to $T_c$ which revealed\na proportionate relationship with magnetization $M_s$ vs. $T$.

Their dispersion relation and the frequency window for the TP existence\nare discussed for a GaAs-BR interface. Structures containing a gap between the\ntwo reflectors are also considered. Further investigation is performed on a\nstructure containing a layer of graphene between the two reflectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

On the other hand, two\ntext instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detection\nwhich covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach can\nrelieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. To\naddress these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Progressive\nScale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances\nwith arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scale\nof kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scale\nkernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that there\nare large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method is\neffective to split the close text instances, making it easier to use\nsegmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensive\nexperiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the\neffectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curve\ntexts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure\n(82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%. The code will be released\nin the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 06:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 12:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

However, in lists\ngenerated using this strategy, items with high similarity are often placed\nconsecutively. In other words, the generated item list might be biased toward a\nspecific preference. Therefore, this study employs penalties for items with\nhigh similarity being placed next to each other in the list and transforms the\nitem listing problem to a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The QAP is\nwell-known as an NP-hard problem that cannot be solved in polynomial time. To\nsolve the QAP, we employ quantum annealing (QA), which exploits the quantum\ntunneling effect to efficiently solve an optimization problem. In addition, we\npropose a problem decomposition method based on the structure of the item\nlisting problem because the quantum annealer we use (i.e., D-Wave 2000Q) has a\nlimited number of quantum bits.

We believe that it\nwill be a robust IDM privacy-preserving solution in cloud computing, because it\nhas the following features: (i) protects sensitive data on untrusted hosts\nusing active bundle; (ii) supports the minimum disclosure property; (iii)\nminimizes authentication overhead by providing single sign-on; (iv) supports\nauthentication with encrypted credentials; (v) avoids using trusted third\nparties (TTPs_, incl. using TTPs for key management; (vi) supports revocation\nand delegation of access right; and (vii) supports revocation of user\ncredentials. The scheme should also be efficient because it exploits\nparallelism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 11:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

The aggregation process, which\nusually takes a large portion of the overall execution time, incurs large\namount of network traffic and bottlenecks the system performance. To reduce\nnetwork traffic,some researches take advantage of network devices to commit\ninnetwork aggregation. However, these approaches use either special topology or\nmiddle-boxes, which cannot be easily deployed in current datacenters. The\nemerging programmable RMT switch brings us new opportunities to implement\nin-network computation task. However, we argue that the architecture of RMT\nswitch is not suitable for in-network aggregation since it is designed\nprimarily for implementing traditional network functions. In this paper, we\nfirst give a detailed analysis of in-network aggregation, and point out the key\nfactor that affects the data reduction ratio.
