Second, motive, which was not considered\nrelevant to previous murders, is added as a parameter. Third, Mr. Boddy's\nlittle-known asthmatic condition is considered as an alternative cause of\ndeath.

The\nClass 0 protostellar system IRAS16293-2422 contains two protostars, 'A' and\n'B', separated by ~600 au and embedded in a single, 10^4 au scale envelope.\nTheir relative evolutionary stages have been debated. We aim to study the\nrelation and interplay between the two protostars A and B at spatial scales of\n60 to ~1000 au. We selected molecular gas line transitions of CO, H2CO, HCN,\nCS, SiO, and CCH from the ALMA-PILS spectral imaging survey (329-363 GHz) and\nused them as tracers of kinematics, density, and temperature in the\nIRAS16293-2422 system. The angular resolution of the PILS data set allows us to\nstudy these quantities at a resolution of 0.5 arcsec (60 au [..]).\nLine-of-sight velocity maps of both optically thick and optically thin\nmolecular lines reveal: (i) new manifestations of previously known outflows\nemanating from protostar A; (ii) a kinematically quiescent bridge of dust and\ngas spanning between the two protostars, with an inferred density between 4\n10^4 and 3 10^7 cm^-3; and (iii) a separate, straight filament seemingly\nconnected to protostar B seen only in CCH, with a flat kinematic signature.\nSigns of various outflows, all emanating from source A, are evidence of\nhigh-density and warmer gas; none of them coincide spatially and kinematically\nwith the bridge. We hypothesize that the bridge arc is a remnant of filamentary\nsubstructure in the protostellar envelope material from which protostellar\nsources A and B have formed. One particular morphological structure appears to\nbe due to outflowing gas impacting the quiescent bridge material. The\ncontinuing lack of clear outflow signatures unambiguously associated to\nprotostar B and the vertically extended shape derived for its disk-like\nstructure lead us to conclude that source B may be in an earlier evolutionary\nstage than source A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

One of the foundations of\nthis paradigm is the finding, based on studies of the radial column density\nprofiles, that nearby filaments share a common inner width of ~0.1 pc. The\nexistence of a characteristic filament width has been questioned, however, as\nit seems inconsistent with the scale-free nature of the power spectrum of cloud\nimages.\n  In an effort to clarify the origin of this apparent discrepancy, we examined\nthe power spectra of the Herschel 250 micron images of the Polaris, Aquila, and\nTaurus clouds and performed a number of simple numerical experiments by\ninjecting synthetic filaments in both the Herschel images and synthetic\nbackground images.\n  We constructed several populations of synthetic filaments of 0.1 pc width\nwith realistic area filling factors ($A_{\\rm fil}$) and distributions of column\ndensity contrasts ($\\delta_c$). After adding synthetic filaments to the\nHerschel images, we re-computed the image power spectra and compared the\nresults with the original, essentially scale-free power spectra. We used the\n$\\chi^2$ variance of the residuals between the best power-law fit and the\noutput power spectrum as a diagnostic of the presence of a significant\ndeparture from a scale-free power spectrum.\n  We found that the $\\chi^2$ variance depends primarily on the combined\nparameter $\\delta_c^2\\, A_{\\rm fil}$. Analysis of the real Herschel data shows\nthat the observed filamentary structure contributes only 1/5 of the power in\nthe power spectra at angular frequencies where an effect of the characteristic\nfilament width is expected.\n  We conclude that the scale-free power spectra of Herschel images remain\nconsistent with the existence of a characteristic filament width ~0.1 pc and do\nnot invalidate the conclusions drawn from studies of the filament profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Thus, bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) is essential. Most bosonic\nQEC schemes encode a finite-dimensional logical qubit or qudit into noisy\nbosonic oscillator modes. In this case, however, the infinite-dimensional\nbosonic nature of the physical system is lost at the error-corrected logical\nlevel. On the other hand, there are several proposals for encoding an\noscillator mode into many noisy oscillator modes. However, these\noscillator-into-oscillators encoding schemes are in the class of Gaussian\nquantum error correction. Therefore, these codes cannot correct practically\nrelevant Gaussian errors due to the established no-go theorems which state that\nGaussian errors cannot be corrected by using only Gaussian resources. Here, we\ncircumvent these no-go results and show that it is possible to correct Gaussian\nerrors by using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as non-Gaussian\nresources. In particular, we propose a non-Gaussian oscillator-into-oscillators\ncode, the two-mode GKP-repetition code, and demonstrate that it can correct\nadditive Gaussian noise errors. In addition, we generalize the two-mode\nGKP-repetition code to an even broader class of non-Gaussian oscillator codes,\nnamely, GKP-stabilizer codes. Specifically, we show that there exists a highly\nhardware-efficient GKP-stabilizer code, the GKP-two-mode-squeezing code, that\ncan quadratically suppress additive Gaussian noise errors in both the position\nand momentum quadratures up to a small logarithmic correction. Moreover, for\nany GKP-stabilizer code, we show that logical Gaussian operations can be\nreadily implemented by using only physical Gaussian operations. We also show\nthat our oscillator codes can correct practically relevant excitation loss and\nthermal noise errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 12:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In the\ntwo-dimensional case, the time of this transformation depends weakly on the\ninitial strength of the poloidal magnetic field because of the development of a\nmagnetorotational instability. Differential rotation leads to the twisting and\ngrowth of the toroidal magnetic-field component, which becomes much stronger\nthan the poloidal component. In the case where the initial configuration of the\nmagnetic field is close to a dipole configuration, the ejection of matter has a\njet character, whereas, in the case of a quadrupole configuration, there arises\nan equatorial ejection. In either case, the energy release is sufficient for\nexplaining the observed average energy of supernova explosion. Neutrinos are\nemitted as the collapse and the formation of a rapidly rotating neutron star\nproceeds. In addition, neutrino radiation arises in the process of\nmagnetorotational explosion owing to additional rotational-energy losses. In\norder to explain an interval of 4.5 hours between the two observed neutrino\nsignals from SN 1987A, it is necessary to assume a weakening of the\nmagnetorotional instability and a small initial magnetic field (10(9)-10(10)G)\nin the newly formed rotating neutron star.

We deduce a quadratic time algorithm for the minimum cut problem in the\nsame class of graphs without computing the maximum flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 17:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 21:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

The method is based on volume penalization,\nallowing for the imposition of a cubical geometry inside of its circumscribing\nsphere. By choosing to embed the cube inside of the sphere, one obtains a\ndiscretization that is free of any sharp edges or corners. Taking full\nadvantage of the simple geometry of the sphere, spectral bases based on\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics and Jacobi polynomials, which properly\ncapture the regularity of scalar, vector and tensor components in spherical\ncoordinates, can be applied to obtain moderately efficient and accurate\nnumerical solutions of partial differential equations in the cube. This\ntechnique demonstrates the advantages of these bases over other methods for\nsolving PDEs in spherical coordinates.

The C2H2 line fluxes are extremely low due to\na lack of abundance in the infrared line-emitting regions, despite C2H2 being\ncommonly detected with Spitzer, suggesting that warm chemistry in the inner\ndisk may need further investigation.

These systems are very attractive for a wide range of\napplications due to their unique features. However, dynamics, control and\nmanipulation tasks of such systems are quite challenging because they are\nnaturally unstable, have very fast dynamics, have strong nonlinearities, are\nvery susceptible to parameters variations due to carrying a payload besides the\nexternal disturbances, and have complex inverse kinematics. In addition, the\nmanipulation tasks require estimating (applying) a certain force of (at) the\nend-effector as well as the accurate positioning of it. Thus, in this article,\na robust force estimation and impedance control scheme is proposed to address\nthese issues. The robustness is achieved based on the Disturbance Observer\n(DOb) technique. Then, a tracking and performance low computational linear\ncontroller is used. For teleoperation purpose, the contact force needs to be\nidentified. However, the current developed techniques for force estimation have\nlimitations because they are based on ignoring some dynamics and/or requiring\nof an indicator of the environment contact. Unlike these techniques, we propose\na technique based on linearization capabilities of DOb and a Fast Tracking\nRecursive Least Squares (FTRLS) algorithm. The complex inverse kinematics\nproblem of such a system is solved by a Jacobin based algorithm. The stability\nanalysis of the proposed scheme is presented. The algorithm is tested to\nachieve tracking of task space reference trajectories besides the impedance\ncontrol.

At high\nprecision, a similar effect is well-known in transit \"transmission\nspectroscopy\" but this related effect also impacts emission and reflection. As\nis well-appreciated, the photospheric radius can vary across $\\sim$4-8\natmospheric scale heights, depending on atmospheric opacity and spectral\nresolution. This effect leads to a decreased weighting in model calculations at\nwavelengths where atmospheric opacity is low, and one sees more deeply into the\natmosphere, to a smaller radius. The overall effect serves to mute emission\nspectra features for atmospheres with no thermal inversion but to enhance\nfeatures for atmospheres with a thermal inversion.

We report a scale height-to-radius aspect ratio of $h =\n0.031_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ between radii of $\\sim 23$ au and $\\sim 41$ au.\nComparing this aspect ratio to a theoretical model of size-dependent velocity\ndistributions in the collisional cascade, we find that the perturbing bodies\nembedded in the local disk must be larger than about 400 km, and the largest\nperturbing body must be smaller than roughly 1.8 M$_\\odot$. These measurements\nrule out the presence of a gas giant or Neptune analog near the $\\sim 40$ au\nouter edge of the debris ring, but are suggestive of large planetesimals or an\nEarth-sized planet stirring the dust distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 18:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 20:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

This may lead to a scenario that was not postulated in the\ndesign phase. Due to this, formulating a rule based decision maker for\nselecting maneuvers may not be ideal. Similarly, it may not be effective to\ndesign an a-priori cost function and then solve the optimal control problem in\nreal-time. In order to address these issues and to avoid peculiar behaviors\nwhen encountering unforeseen scenario, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)\nbased method, where the ego car, i.e., an autonomous vehicle, learns to make\ndecisions by directly interacting with simulated traffic. The decision maker\nfor AV is implemented as a deep neural network providing an action choice for a\ngiven system state. In a critical application such as driving, an RL agent\nwithout explicit notion of safety may not converge or it may need extremely\nlarge number of samples before finding a reliable policy. To best address the\nissue, this paper incorporates reinforcement learning with an additional short\nhorizon safety check (SC). In a critical scenario, the safety check will also\nprovide an alternate safe action to the agent provided if it exists. This leads\nto two novel contributions. First, it generalizes the states that could lead to\nundesirable \"near-misses\" or \"collisions \". Second, inclusion of safety check\ncan provide a safe and stable training environment. This significantly enhances\nlearning efficiency without inhibiting meaningful exploration to ensure safe\nand optimal learned behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the developed\nalgorithm in highway driving scenario where the trained AV encounters varying\ntraffic density in a highway setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 18:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

At first, bi-directional breadth-first search (BFS) is proposed and\nadopted on graph model to detect the potential shedding component in\ncontingency analysis. It implements hierarchical parallelism of the graph\ntraverse and speedup its process. Then, the idea of evolving graph is\nintroduced in this paper to improve computation performance. For each\ncontingency scenario, N-1 contingency graph quickly derives from system graph\nin basic status, and parallelly analyzes each contingency scenario using graph\ncomputing. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach have been\ntested and verified by IEEE 118-bus system and a practical case SC 2645-bus\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 18:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

The problem with\nthis approach is that is usually very difficult to find the optimal cost and\nthe optmal feedback on a large domain for nonlinear problems with or without\nconstraints.

The presented scheme continuously collects measurements to reduce\nthe uncertainty about the system parameters and adapts dynamic robust\ncontrollers online in a stable and performance-improving way. A key enabler for\nour approach is choosing a time-varying dynamic controller implementation,\ninspired by recent work on System Level Synthesis.

They are\nnothing but vacuum fluctuations, stretched to cosmological scales by the cosmic\nexpansion and amplified by gravitational instability. At the end of inflation,\nthese perturbations are placed in a two-mode squeezed state with the strongest\nsqueezing ever produced in Nature (much larger than anything that can be made\nin the laboratory on Earth). This article studies whether astrophysical\nobservations could unambiguously reveal this quantum origin by borrowing ideas\nfrom quantum information theory. It is argued that some of the tools needed to\ncarry out this task have been discussed long ago by J. Bell in a, so far,\nlargely unrecognized contribution. A detailed study of his paper and of the\ncriticisms that have been put forward against his work is presented. Although\nJ. Bell could not have realized it when he wrote his letter since the quantum\nstate of cosmological perturbations was not yet fully characterized at that\ntime, it is also shown that Cosmology and cosmic inflation represent the most\ninteresting frameworks to apply the concepts he investigated. This confirms\nthat cosmic inflation is not only a successful paradigm to understand the early\nUniverse. It is also the only situation in Physics where one crucially needs\nGeneral Relativity and Quantum Mechanics to derive the predictions of a theory\nand, where, at the same time, we have high-accuracy data to test these\npredictions, making inflation a playground of utmost importance to discuss\nfoundational issues in Quantum Mechanics\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 20:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

A novel methodology using Gaussian process latent force models\nis proposed to tackle the problem in a stochastic setting. Gaussian process\nlatent force models (GPLFMs) are hybrid models that combine differential\nequations representing a physical system with data-driven non-parametric\nGaussian process models. In this work, the unknown input forces acting on a\nstructure are modelled as Gaussian processes with some chosen covariance\nfunctions which are combined with the mechanistic differential equation\nrepresenting the structure to construct a GPLFM. The GPLFM is then conveniently\nformulated as an augmented stochastic state-space model with additional states\nrepresenting the latent force components, and the joint input and state\ninference of the resulting model is implemented using Kalman filter. The\naugmented state-space model of GPLFM is shown as a generalization of the class\nof input-augmented state-space models, is proven observable, and is robust\ncompared to conventional augmented formulations in terms of numerical\nstability. The hyperparameters governing the covariance functions are estimated\nusing maximum likelihood optimization based on the observed data, thus\novercoming the need for manual tuning of the hyperparameters by\ntrial-and-error. To assess the performance of the proposed GPLFM method,\nseveral cases of state and input estimation are demonstrated using numerical\nsimulations on a 10-dof shear building and a 76-storey ASCE benchmark office\ntower.

While this approach has been extensively tested for red giant\nbranch (RGB) stars, it has been more difficult to test for helium core-burning\nred-clump (RC) giants because of the lack of fundamental calibrators. To\nprovide independent mass estimates, we utilize a number of widely used\nhorizontal-branch (HB) models in the literature, and derive photometric masses\nfrom a comparison with $griBVI_CJHK_s$ photometry. Our selected models disagree\nwith each other on the predicted mass-luminosity-temperature relation. We adopt\nfirst-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the dispersion\nbetween different models by forcing models to match the observed location in\nthe solar-metallicity cluster M67. Even for these calibrated models, however,\nthe internal consistency between models deteriorates at higher metallicities,\nand photometric masses become smaller than asteroseismic masses, as seen from\nmetal-rich field RC stars with Gaia parallaxes. Similarly, the average\nphotometric mass for metal-rich NGC 6791 stars ranges from $0.7\\ M_\\odot$ to\n$1.1\\ M_\\odot$, depending on the specific set of models employed. An ensemble\naverage of the photometric masses ($0.88\\pm0.16\\ M_\\odot$) in NGC 6791 is\nmarginally consistent with the asteroseismic mass ($1.16\\pm0.04\\ M_\\odot$).\nThere is a clear tension between the masses that one would predict from\nphotometry for metal-rich field RC stars, asteroseismic masses, and those that\nwould be expected from the ages of stars in the Galactic disk populations and\ncanonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that standard RC models need to be\nre-examined in light of these powerful new data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 00:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 08:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

We find\nthat, although DAMA/LIBRA and COSINE-100 use the same sodium-iodide target, the\ncomparison of the two results still depends on the particle-physics model. This\nis mainly due to two reasons: i) the WIMP signal spectral shape; ii) the\nexpected modulation fractions, when the upper bound on the time-averaged rate\nin COSINE-100 is converted into a constraint on the annual modulation component\nin DAMA/LIBRA. We find that the latter effect is the dominant one. For several\neffective operators the expected modulation fractions are larger than in the\nstandard spin-independent or spin-dependent interaction cases. As a\nconsequence, compatibility between the modulation effect observed in DAMA/LIBRA\nand the null result from COSINE-100 is still possible for several\nnon-relativistic operators. At low WIMP masses such relatively high values of\nthe modulation fractions arise because COSINE-100 is mainly sensitive to\nWIMP-sodium scattering events, due to the higher threshold compared to\nDAMA/LIBRA.

This identification follows directly\nfrom the pair wave functions behavior, which in the BCS and BEC sides become\nexponentially localized and oscillatory slowly decaying respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 02:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

This\nforms a thermodynamic picture in which a closed system interacts with an\nexternal reservoir, reaching its equilibrium at the worst-case scenario. The\nseverity of the worst-case scenario depends on the rate of heat dissipation,\ncaused by information sources reducing the entropy of the system.

In the context of cosmology, while the perturbations remain\ninvariant for a single scalar field model, the background equations differ and\ntherefore the dynamics. However, since the background dynamics are not the\nsame, it is not clear whether the attractor nature of the solutions remains the\nsame in all conformally connected frames, i.e., a stable solution in one frame\nimplies an equivalent stable solution in another frame. To answer the question,\nin this work, we first consider power law cosmology in the Brans-Dicke theory\nas well as in the conformal Einstein frame. We show that, in this case, the\nattractor behavior is indeed equivalent under conformal transformation, i.e.,\nan attractor solution in one frame implies an attractor solution in another\nframe. However, the decay rates of the deviations from the fixed points are\ndifferent in the two frames. We are able to relate the behavior and find that\nthe difference is due to the difference in e-fold 'clocks' in different frames,\ni.e., $\\Delta N$ in different frames differ from one another. We show that the\nbehavior is indeed true for any model in conformally connected frames and\nobtain the general 'equivalence' relation.

However, existing age datasets lies in a limited\nrange of ages, leading to a long-tailed distribution. To alleviate the problem,\nthis paper proposes a Universal Variational Aging (UVA) framework to formulate\nfacial age priors in a disentangling manner. Benefiting from the variational\nevidence lower bound, the facial images are encoded and disentangled into an\nage-irrelevant distribution and an age-related distribution in the latent\nspace. A conditional introspective adversarial learning mechanism is introduced\nto boost the image quality. In this way, when manipulating the age-related\ndistribution, UVA can achieve age translation with arbitrary ages. Further, by\nsampling noise from the age-irrelevant distribution, we can generate\nphotorealistic facial images with a specific age. Moreover, given an input face\nimage, the mean value of age-related distribution can be treated as an age\nestimator. These indicate that UVA can efficiently and accurately estimate the\nage-related distribution by a disentangling manner, even if the training\ndataset performs a long-tailed age distribution. UVA is the first attempt to\nachieve facial age analysis tasks, including age translation, age generation\nand age estimation, in a universal framework. The qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of UVA on five popular datasets,\nincluding CACD2000, Morph, UTKFace, MegaAge-Asian and FG-NET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 07:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

In this paper, we\nconsider the coherent detection and parameters estimation problem for a radar\nmoving target with unknown entry time and departure time (that is, the time\nwhen the target appears-in/leaves the radar detection field is unknown),\ninvolving across range cell (ARC) and Doppler spread (DS) effects within the\nobservation period. A new algorithm, known as window Radon Fractional Fourier\ntransform (WRFRFT) is proposed to detect and estimate the target's time\nparameters (i.e., entry time and departure time) and motion parameters (i.e.,\nrange, velocity and acceleration). The observation values of a maneuvering\ntarget are first intercepted and extracted by the window function and searching\nalong the motion trajectory. Then these values are fractional Fourier\ntransformed and well accumulated in the WRFRFT domain, where the DAPE of target\ncould be accomplished thereafter. Experiments with simulated and real radar\ndata sets prove its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 08:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

It aims at\nrecognizing unseen class instances with knowledge transferred from seen\nclasses. This is typically achieved by exploiting a pre-defined semantic\nfeature space (FS), i.e., semantic attributes or word vectors, as a bridge to\ntransfer knowledge between seen and unseen classes. However, due to the absence\nof unseen classes during training, the conventional ZSR easily suffers from\ndomain shift and hubness problems. In this paper, we propose a novel ZSR\nlearning framework that can handle these two issues well by adaptively\nadjusting semantic FS. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to\nconsider the adaptive adjustment of semantic FS in ZSR. Moreover, our solution\ncan be formulated to a more efficient framework that significantly boosts the\ntraining.

It is thus a rather attractive\nassumption to base statistical analysis on, especially for problems for which\nless general qualitative assumptions, such as independence or finite memory,\nclearly fail. However, it has long been considered too general to allow for\nstatistical inference to be made. One of the reasons for this is that rates of\nconvergence, even of frequencies to the mean, are not available under this\nassumption alone. Recently, it has been shown that, while some natural and\nsimple problems such as homogeneity, are indeed provably impossible to solve if\none only assumes that the data is stationary (or stationary ergodic), many\nothers can be solved using rather simple and intuitive algorithms. The latter\nproblems include clustering and change point estimation. In this volume I\nsummarize these results. The emphasis is on asymptotic consistency, since this\nthe strongest property one can obtain assuming stationarity alone. While for\nmost of the problems for which a solution is found this solution is\nalgorithmically realizable, the main objective in this area of research, the\nobjective which is only partially attained, is to understand what is possible\nand what is not possible to do for stationary time series. The considered\nproblems include homogeneity testing, clustering with respect to distribution,\nclustering with respect to independence, change-point estimation, identity\ntesting, and the general question of composite hypotheses testing. For the\nlatter problem, a topological criterion for the existence of a consistent test\nis presented.

Through reformulating the convection term and the force\nterm via the auxiliary variable, zero numerical flux and zero numerical source\nterm are enforced at the hydrostatic equilibrium state instead of the balance\nbetween hydrostatic pressure and external force. Several problems are tested\nnumerically to demonstrate the accuracy and the stability of the new scheme,\nand the results confirm that, the new scheme can preserve the exact hydrostatic\nsolution. The small perturbation riding on hydrostatic equilibria can be\ncalculated accurately.

WR 133 is one of the shortest period Wolf-Rayet + O systems\nin this category, and is therefore critical to characterize the boundaries of\nthe parameter space adequate for particle acceleration in massive binaries. Our\nmethodology consists in analyzing JVLA observations of WR 133 at different\nepochs to search for compelling evidence for a phase-locked variation\nattributable to synchrotron emission produced in the colliding-wind region. New\ndata obtained during two orbits reveal a steady and thermal emission spectrum,\nin apparent contradiction with the previous detection of non-thermal emission.\nThe thermal nature of the radio spectrum along the 112.4-d orbit is supported\nby the strong free-free absorption by the dense stellar winds, and shows that\nthe simple binary scenario cannot explain the non-thermal emission reported\npreviously. Alternatively, a triple system scenario with a wide, outer orbit\nwould fit with the observational facts reported previously and in this paper,\nalbeit no hint for the existence of a third component exists to date.

To alleviate this problem, recent methods have tried to leverage weak\nlabeling, where videos are untrimmed and only a video-level label is available.\nIn this paper, we propose RefineLoc, a novel weakly-supervised temporal action\nlocalization method. RefineLoc uses an iterative refinement approach by\nestimating and training on snippet-level pseudo ground truth at every\niteration. We show the benefit of this iterative approach and present an\nextensive analysis of five different pseudo ground truth generators. We show\nthe effectiveness of our model on two standard action datasets, ActivityNet\nv1.2 and THUMOS14. RefineLoc shows competitive results with the\nstate-of-the-art in weakly-supervised temporal localization.

As such, earthshine may enable the\nexploration of areas of the Moon that are hidden from solar illumination. The\nheat flux from earthshine may also influence the transport and cold trapping of\nvolatiles present in the very coldest areas. In this study, Earth's spectral\nradiance at the Moon is examined using a suite of Earth spectral models created\nusing the Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) three dimensional modeling\ncapability. At the Moon, the broadband, hemispherical irradiance from Earth\nnear 0 phase is approximately 0.15 watts per square meter, with comparable\ncontributions from solar reflectance and thermal emission. Over the simulation\ntimeframe, spanning two lunations, Earth's thermal irradiance changes less than\na few mW per square meter as a result of cloud variability and the\nsouth-to-north motion of sub-observer position. In solar band, Earth's\ndiurnally averaged light curve at phase angles < 60 degrees is well fit using a\nHenyey Greenstein integral phase function. At wavelengths > 0.7 microns, near\nthe well known vegetation \"red edge\", Earth's reflected solar radiance shows\nsignificant diurnal modulation as a result of the longitudinal asymmetry in\nprojected landmass, as well as from the distribution of clouds. A simple\nformulation with adjustable coefficients is presented for estimating Earth's\nhemispherical irradiance at the Moon as a function of wavelength, phase angle\nand sub-observer coordinates.

Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the\ntractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear\ndynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms\nnecessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive\nability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This\nprovides an algorithmic approach to Occam's razor for model discovery. However,\nthis approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which\nthe dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom\nautoencoder to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where\nthe dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the\ngoverning equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this\napproach on several example high-dimensional dynamical systems with\nlow-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the\nstrengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse\nidentification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. It is the\nfirst method of its kind to place the discovery of coordinates and models on an\nequal footing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 23:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 23:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

However, the maximum time step is limited by the smallest\noscillation period of the fastest atomic motion, rendering long-time\nsimulations very expensive. To resolve this bottleneck, we propose a supervised\nparallel-in-time algorithm for stochastic dynamics (SPASD) to accelerate\nlong-time Lagrangian particle simulations. Our method is inspired by bottom-up\ncoarse-graining projections that yield mean-field hydrodynamic behavior in the\ncontinuum limit. Here as an example, we use the dissipative particle dynamics\n(DPD) as the Lagrangian particle simulator that is supervised by its\nmacroscopic counterpart, i.e., the Navier-Stokes simulator. The low-dimensional\nmacroscopic system (here, the Navier-Stokes solver) serves as a predictor to\nsupervise the high-dimensional Lagrangian simulator, in a predictor-corrector\ntype algorithm. The results of the Lagrangian simulation then correct the\nmean-field prediction and provide the proper microscopic details (e.g.,\nconsistent fluctuations, correlations, etc.). The unique feature that sets\nSPASD apart from other multiscale methods is the use of a low-fidelity\nmacroscopic model as a predictor. The macro-model can be approximate and even\ninconsistent with the microscale description, but SPASD anticipates the\ndeviation and corrects it internally to recover the true dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 18:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

There is a critical need for developing inference models for\nmultiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across\ndifferent layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a\nlimited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for\ncommunity detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the\nability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast,\nmany existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our\nmodel automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer\n(as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the\nnumber of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and\nespecially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change\nacross layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a\nhierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing\ndependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block\nmodel (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler\nfor sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the\nlink probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique\nchallenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the\nhierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical\nvalidation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior\nperformance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability\nto uncover interesting structures in real networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 02:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 21:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}
