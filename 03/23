Our motivation derives from graph\nanalysis, e.g., studies of (infinite) electrical networks of resistors, but our\nfocus will be (ii), i.e., the measure theoretic setting. In electrical networks\nof resistors, one considers pairs (of typically countably infinite), sets $V$\n(vertices), $E$ (edges) a suitable subset of $V \\times V$, and prescribed\npositive symmetric functions $c$ on $E$ . A conductance function $c$ is defined\non $E$ (edges), or on $V \\times V$, but with $E$ as its support. From an\ninitial triple $(V, E, c)$ , one gets graph-Laplacians, generalized Dirichlet\nspaces (also called energy Hilbert spaces), dipoles, relative reproducing\nkernel-theory, dissipation spaces, reversible Markov chains, and more.\n  Our main results include: spectral theory and Green's functions for measure\ntheoretic graph-Laplace operators; the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspaces related to Laplace operators; a rigorous analysis of the Laplacian on\nBorel equivalence relations; a new decomposition theory; irreducibility\ncriteria; dynamical systems governed by endomorphisms and measurable fields;\norbit equivalence criteria; and path-space measures and induced dissipation\nHilbert spaces.

In this paper, we present explicitly the idea of a quantum\naccelerator which contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such\na stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the\naccelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm\nthat is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case, the logic is\nexpressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language\ndeveloped in the group, called OpenQL, which visualised the quantum processor\nas a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a\ncommon assembly language, called cQASM, which can be executed on a quantum\nsimulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the\nmicro-architecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. In a subsequent\nstep, the compiler can convert the cQASM to generate the eQASM, which is\nexecutable on a particular experimental device incorporating the\nplatform-specific parameters. This way, we are able to distinguish clearly the\nexperimental research towards better qubits, and the industrial and societal\napplications that need to be developed and executed on a quantum device. The\nfirst case offers experimental physicists with a full-stack experimental\nplatform using realistic qubits with decoherence and error-rates while the\nsecond case offers perfect qubits to the quantum application developer, where\nthere is no decoherence nor error-rates.

However, these models are\nconstructed based on scarce and often inaccurate data, making their predictions\nhighly uncertain. On the other hand, measurements of pressure and flow rates\nare constantly collected during the operation of the field. The assimilation of\nthese data into the reservoir models (history matching) helps to mitigate\nuncertainty and improve their predictive capacity. History matching is a\nnonlinear inverse problem, which is typically handled using optimization and\nMonte Carlo methods. In practice, however, generating a set of properly\nhistory-matched models that preserve the geological realism is very\nchallenging, especially in cases with complicated prior description, such as\nmodels with fractures and complex facies distributions. Recently, a new\ndata-space inversion (DSI) approach was introduced in the literature as an\nalternative to the model-space inversion used in history matching. The\nessential idea is to update directly the predictions from a prior ensemble of\nmodels to account for the observed production history without updating the\ncorresponding models. The present paper introduces a DSI implementation based\non the use of an iterative ensemble smoother and demonstrates with examples\nthat the new implementation is computationally faster and more robust than the\nearlier method based on principal component analysis. The new DSI is also\napplied to estimate the production forecast in a real field with long\nproduction history and a large number of wells. For this field problem, the new\nDSI obtained forecasts comparable with a more traditional ensemble-based\nhistory matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 16:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

We present essential techniques to differentiate through the tensor\nnetworks contractions, including stable AD for tensor decomposition and\nefficient backpropagation through fixed point iterations. As a demonstration,\nwe compute the specific heat of the Ising model directly by taking the second\norder derivative of the free energy obtained in the tensor renormalization\ngroup calculation. Next, we perform gradient based variational optimization of\ninfinite projected entangled pair states for quantum antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model and obtain start-of-the-art variational energy and\nmagnetization with moderate efforts. Differentiable programming removes\nlaborious human efforts in deriving and implementing analytical gradients for\ntensor network programs, which opens the door to more innovations in tensor\nnetwork algorithms and applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

At present, the degree to which galaxy assembly bias may be present in\nthe real Universe, and the best strategies for constraining it remain\nuncertain. We study the ability of several observables to constrain galaxy\nassembly bias from redshift survey data using the decorated halo occupation\ndistribution (dHOD), an empirical model of the galaxy--halo connection that\nincorporates assembly bias.

But, the goals of\namplification and robust stability when connected to the operator fundamentally\nconflict. As a solution, we introduce a design with a spring in series with the\nforce sensitive cuff. This allows us to design an exoskeleton compliance\nbehavior which is nominally passive, even with high amplification ratios. In\npractice, time delay and discrete time filters prevent our strategy from\nactually achieving passivity, but the designed compliance still makes the\nexoskeleton more robust to spring-like human behaviors. Our exoskeleton is\nactuated by a series elastic actuator (SEA), which introduces another spring\ninto the system. We show that shaping the cuff compliance for the exoskeleton\ncan be made into approximately the same problem as shaping the spring\ncompliance of an SEA. We therefore introduce a feedback controller and gain\ntuning method which takes advantage of an existing compliance shaping technique\nfor SEAs. We call our strategy the \"double compliance shaping\" method. With\nlarge amplification ratios, this controller tends to amplify nonlinear\ntransmission friction effects, so we additionally propose a \"transmission\ndisturbance observer\" to mitigate this drawback.

The assumption of\nindependence leads to simple strategies for evaluating PCE coefficients. In\ncontrast, the application of PCE to models of dependent variables is much more\nchallenging. Three approaches can be used. The first approach uses mapping\nmethods where measure transformations, such as the Nataf and Rosenblatt\ntransformation, can be used to map dependent random variables to independent\nones; however we show that this can significantly degrade performance since the\nJacobian of the map must be approximated. A second strategy is the class of\ndominating support methods which build PCE using independent random variables\nwhose distributional support dominates the support of the true dependent joint\ndensity; we provide evidence that this approach appears to produce\napproximations with suboptimal accuracy. A third approach, the novel method\nproposed here, uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) to numerically compute\northonormal polynomials for the dependent random variables. This approach has\nbeen used successfully when solving differential equations using the intrusive\nstochastic Galerkin method, and in this paper we use GSO to build PCE using a\nnon-intrusive stochastic collocation method. The stochastic collocation method\ntreats the model as a black box and builds approximations of model output from\na set of samples. Building PCE from samples can introduce ill-conditioning\nwhich does not plague stochastic Galerkin methods. To mitigate this\nill-conditioning we generate weighted Leja sequences, which are nested sample\nsets, to build accurate polynomial interpolants.

The bitrate adaptation mechanisms that drive video\nstreaming clash with caching hierarchies in ways that affect users' Quality of\nExperience (QoE). Cache performance also diminishes as consumers dynamically\nselect content encoded at different bitrates. In this paper we use the evidence\nto draw a novel insight: in a cache hierarchy for adaptive streaming content,\nbitrates should be prioritized over or alongside popularity and hit rates. We\nbuild on this insight to propose RippleCache as a family of cache placement\nschemes that safeguard high-bitrate content at the edge and push low-bitrate\ncontent into the network core. Doing so reduces contention of cache resources,\nas well as congestion in the network. To validate RippleCache claims we\nconstruct two separate implementations. We design RippleClassic as a benchmark\nsolution that optimizes content placement by maximizing a measure for cache\nhierarchies shown to have high correlation with QoE. In addition, our\nlighter-weight RippleFinder is then re-designed with distributed execution for\napplication in large-scale systems. RippleCache performance gains are\nreinforced by evaluations in NS-3 against state-of-the-art baseline approaches,\nusing standard measures of QoE as defined by the DASH Industry Forum.\nMeasurements show that RippleClassic and RippleFinder deliver content that\nsuffers less oscillation and rebuffering, as well as the highest levels of\nvideo quality, indicating overall improvements to QoE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 20:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

Planets with\ncharacteristics suitable for atmospheric characterization have orbits of\nseveral days, thus phase curve observations are highly resource intensive,\nespecially for shared use facilities. In this work, we show that an infrared\nspectrograph operating from a high altitude balloon platform can perform\nphase-resolved spectroscopy of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets with performance\ncomparable to a space-based telescope. Using the EXoplanet Climate Infrared\nTElescope (EXCITE) experiment as an example, we quantify the impact of the most\nimportant systematic effects that we expect to encounter from a balloon\nplatform. We show an instrument like EXCITE will have the stability and\nsensitivity to significantly advance our understanding of exoplanet\natmospheres.

In the outburst cases, the glitches tend to induce larger frequency\nchanges compared to those unassociated ones. We argue that a larger glitch is\nmore likely to trigger the outburst mechanism, either by reconfiguration of the\nmagnetosphere or deformation of the crust. A more frequent and deeper\nmonitoring of magnetars is necessary for further investigation of their\nconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 00:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

In this setup, the traditional sparsity assumption on\nthe regression coefficients often fails to hold, and consequently many model\nselection procedures do not work. To address this challenge, we model the\nvariations of covariates by a factor structure. Specifically, strong\ncorrelations among covariates are explained by common factors and the remaining\nvariations are interpreted as idiosyncratic components of each covariate. This\nleads to a factor-adjusted regression model with both common factors and\nidiosyncratic components as covariates. We generalize the traditional sparsity\nassumption accordingly and assume that all common factors but only a small\nnumber of idiosyncratic components contribute to the response. A Bayesian\nprocedure with a spike-and-slab prior is then proposed for parameter estimation\nand model selection.

We find that smaller clouds become trapped in the advective\nflows generated by larger clouds.

To exploit benefits of both model-free RL and optimal control, we\npropose time-to-reach-based (TTR-based) reward shaping, an optimal\ncontrol-inspired technique to alleviate data inefficiency while retaining\nadvantages of model-free RL. This is achieved by summarizing key system model\ninformation using a TTR function to greatly speed up the RL process, as shown\nin our simulation results. The TTR function is defined as the minimum time\nrequired to move from any state to the goal under assumed system dynamics\nconstraints.

Here we\nexplore the orientation dependence of spherical nano-indentation in pure and\nhelium-implanted tungsten, considering grains with <001>, <110> and <111>\nout-of-plane orientations. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of indents in\nunimplanted tungsten shows little orientation dependence. However, in the\nimplanted material a much larger, more localised pile-up is observed for <001>\ngrains than for <110> and <111> orientations.

A crystal plasticity finite element model of the indentation\nprocess, formulated based on this hypothesis, accurately reproduces the\nexperimentally-observed orientation-dependence of indent morphology. The\nresults suggest that the mechanism governing the interaction of helium-induced\ndefects with glide dislocations is orientation independent.

Supervised deep learning methods have\nmade great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the\ncost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. To alleviate this effort\nsynthetic data as well as weak supervision have both been investigated.\nNonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain\nshift while weak labels are often imprecise. Moreover, most existing works for\nweakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The\naim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and\nintegrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this\ngoal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real\ndiscrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak\nlocalization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using\na novel contour-based scheme.

As of today,\nthere are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a\nblockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them\nshare one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation\nof blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work\nscheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most\ncommonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force.\nThe main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large\namounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the\ncurrency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a\nproof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a\nblockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires\ntraining deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance\nof such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to\nverify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more\nefficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be\ngenerated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for\nrewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a\ntheoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be\narticulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial\nintelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 11:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 10:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

The behavior of such\npassive fibers in flow has been of interest in a wide range of systems,\nincluding cellular mechanics, nutrient aquisition by diatom chains in the\nocean, and industrial applications such as paper manufacturing. The rotational\ndynamics and shape evolution of fibers in shear depends upon the slenderness of\nthe fiber and the non-dimensional \"elasto-viscous\" number that measures the\nratio of the fluid's viscous forces to the fiber's elastic forces. For a small\nelasto-viscous number, the nearly-rigid fiber rotates in the shear, but when\nthe elasto-viscous number reaches a threshhold, buckling occurs. For even\nlarger elasto-viscous numbers, there is a transition to a \"snaking behavior\"\nwhere the fiber remains aligned with the shear axis, but its ends curl in, in\nopposite directions. These experimentally-observed behaviors have recently been\ncharacterized computationally using slender-body theory and immersed boundary\ncomputations.

A locally chiral-imbalanced (parity-odd)\ndomain can be created due to the electromagnetically induced $U(1)_A$ anomaly\nin high-dense matters. The proposed local-chiral imbalance generically\npossesses a close relationship to a spacial distribution of an inhomogeneous\nchiral (pion)-vector current coupled to the magnetic field. To demonstrate such\na nontrivial correlation, we take the skyrmion crystal approach to model\nbaryonic/high dense matters. Remarkably enough, we find the chirality-imbalance\ndistribution takes a wave form in a high density region (dobbed\n``chiral-imbalance density wave''), when the inhomogeneous chiral condensate\ndevelops to form a chiral density wave. This implies the emergence of a\nnontrivial density wave for the explicitly broken $U(1)_A$ current\nsimultaneously with the chiral density wave for the spontaneously broken\nchiral-flavor current. We further find that the topological phase transition in\nthe skyrmion crystal model (between skyrmion and half-skyrmion phases)\nundergoes the deformation of the chiral-imbalance density wave in shape and\nperiodicity. The emergence of this chiral-imbalance density wave could give a\ncrucial contribution to studies on the chiral phase transition, as well as the\nnuclear matter structure, in compact stars under a magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 15:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Moreover, the common situation in HSIs\nclassification task is the lack of labeled samples, which results in accuracy\ndeterioration of CNNs. In this work, we develop an easy-to-implement capsule\nnetwork to alleviate the aforementioned problems, i.e., 1D-convolution capsule\nnetwork (1D-ConvCapsNet). Firstly, 1D-ConvCapsNet separately extracts spatial\nand spectral information on spatial and spectral domains, which is more\nlightweight than 3D-convolution due to fewer parameters. Secondly,\n1D-ConvCapsNet utilizes the capsule-wise constraint window method to reduce\nparameter amount and computational complexity of conventional capsule network.\nFinally, 1D-ConvCapsNet obtains accurate predictions with respect to input\nsamples via dynamic routing.

For the simplest and most\nefficient case, two sets of 3-step phase-shifting fringe patterns are used: the\nhigh-frequency one is for 3D measurement and the unit-frequency one is for\nunwrapping the phase obtained from the high-frequency pattern set. The final\nmeasurement precision or sensitivity is determined by the number of fringes\nused within the high-frequency pattern, under the precondition that the phase\ncan be successfully unwrapped without triggering the fringe order error.\nConsequently, in order to guarantee a reasonable unwrapping success rate, the\nfringe number (or period number) of the high-frequency fringe patterns is\ngenerally restricted to about 16, resulting in limited measurement accuracy. On\nthe other hand, using additional intermediate sets of fringe patterns can\nunwrap the phase with higher frequency, but at the expense of a prolonged\npattern sequence. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for\ncomputer vision and computational imaging, in this work, we report that the\ndeep neural networks can learn to perform TPU after appropriate training, as\ncalled deep-learning based temporal phase unwrapping (DL-TPU), which can\nsubstantially improve the unwrapping reliability compared with MF-TPU even in\nthe presence of different types of error sources, e.g., intensity noise, low\nfringe modulation, and projector nonlinearity.

Magnetic reconnection\nis much too slow a process to be efficient on the large scales, but accelerates\nonce small enough scales are formed in the system. For this reason, the fractal\nreconnection scenario was introduced (Shibata and Tanuma 2001) to explain\nexplosive events in the solar atmosphere: it was based on the recursive\ntriggering and collapse via tearing instability of a current sheet originally\nthinned during the rise of a filament in the solar corona. Here we compare the\ndifferent fractal reconnection scenarios that have been proposed, and derive\ngeneralized scaling relations for the recursive triggering of fast, `ideal' -\ni.e. Lundquist number independent - tearing in collapsing current sheet\nconfigurations with arbitrary current profile shapes. An important result is\nthat the Sweet-Parker scaling with Lundquist number, if interpreted as the\naspect ratio of the singular layer in an ideally unstable sheet, is universal\nand does not depend on the details of the current profile in the sheet. Such a\nscaling however must not be interpreted in terms of stationary reconnection,\nrather it defines a step in the accelerating sequence of events of the ideal\ntearing mediated fractal cascade. We calculate scalings for the expected number\nof plasmoids for such generic profiles and realistic Lundquist numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 17:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

The most commonly used imaging technique for diagnosis\nin ophthalmology is optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, analysis of\nretinal OCT requires trained ophthalmologists and time, making a comprehensive\nearly diagnosis unlikely. A recent study established a diagnostic tool based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), which was trained on a large database of\nretinal OCT images. The performance of the tool in classifying retinal\nconditions was on par to that of trained medical experts. However, the training\nof these networks is based on an enormous amount of labeled data, which is\nexpensive and difficult to obtain. Therefore, this paper describes a method\nbased on variational autoencoder regularization that improves classification\nperformance when using a limited amount of labeled data. This work uses a\ntwo-path CNN model combining a classification network with an autoencoder (AE)\nfor regularization. The key idea behind this is to prevent overfitting when\nusing a limited training dataset size with small number of patients. Results\nshow superior classification performance compared to a pre-trained and fully\nfine-tuned baseline ResNet-34. Clustering of the latent space in relation to\nthe disease class is distinct. Neural networks for disease classification on\nOCTs can benefit from regularization using variational autoencoders when\ntrained with limited amount of patient data.
