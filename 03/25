In one approach,\nwe find specifically that the Early Development Instrument measuring childhood\nvulnerabilities across varying domains can be used to cluster neighborhoods,\nand that census variables can help explain similarities between neighborhoods\nwithin these clusters. In our second approach, we use program registration data\nfrom the City of Surrey's Community and Recreation Services Division. We also\nfind a critical age of entry and exit for each program related to early\nchildhood development and beyond, and find that certain neighborhoods and\nrecreational programs have larger retention rates than others.

Three cavitators with the same\nfrontal area are fabricated with 3D printing and mounted on a forward facing\nmodel (FFM). The ventilation requirements to generate (C_Qf) and sustain (C_Qc)\na supercavity are tested over a wide range of Froude number (Fr) for each\ncavitator and compared with backward facing model(BFM). Compared to the\ntriangle and disk cavitators, the cone-shaped cavitator requires the least\namount of air to generate a supercavity in nearly all of the tested flow regime\nexcept very high Fr. The C_Qc of disk FFM is lower than that of its BFM\ncounterpart at small Fr and exceeds the BFM C_Qc with further increase of Fr.\nThe cone cavitator has the smallest C_Qc among all the cavitators across the\nrange of Fr in our experiments. Simultaneous internal pressure and cavity\ndimension measurements are conducted to elucidate the cavity sustenance\nbehaviors. The cone-generated cavity yields a significantly smaller maximum\ndiameter and a shorter half-length. Cavity geometric information and cavity\npressure measurements with high-speed imaging of re-entrant jet are employed to\nestimate the re-entrant jet momentum under different Fr for disk and cone\ncavitators. The estimated re-entrant jet momentum shows reasonable match with\nthe ventilation air momentum under C_Qc in lower Fr for both cavitator cases,\nwith the disk cavitator case yielding significantly stronger re-entrant jet,\nproviding support to the re-entrant jet mechanism governing on the cavity\ncollapse. Our study sheds some light on the cavitator design and ventilation\nstrategy for a supercavitating vehicle in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 17:05:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 19:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

However, the presence of\n$f$-electron valence fluctuations to a non-magnetic state is regarded an\nanathema to QC, as it usually generates a paramagnetic Fermi-liquid state with\nquasiparticles of moderate $m^{*}$.

It is however not sufficient in itself to explain why the whole matter\ndistribution in spiral galaxies is such that the rotation curve generally\npresents a flat profile in the disk region.\n  To understand this property, a model considering general relativistic effects\nis developed. It is stressed that the aim is not to explain the flat rotation\ncurve of spiral galaxies without dark matter. More specifically, the analytical\nstationary solution of an axisymmetric rotating pressureless fluid for the\nlinearized equations of the theory of general relativity is determined. It is\ndemonstrated that this solution leads to some constraints on the rotation\ncurve, by looking to its limit behavior when neglecting general relativistic\neffects. In particular, the positiveness of the density imposes the rotation\ncurve to be flat in the regions where the density and general relativistic\neffects are small, such as in the disk region. General relativistic effects\nhence remain negligible in the disk region, but their consideration proved to\nbe necessary to establish the aforementioned constraint. Such constraint cannot\nbe derived from a Newtonian approach.\n  The model is finally applied on two specific cases to demonstrate its ability\nto predict the rotation curve from a typical density profile along the galactic\nplane.

Yet, NVMs also have\ndisadvantages (e.g., limited endurance). System architects are therefore\nexamining hybrid DRAM-NVM main memories to enable the advantages of NVMs while\navoiding the disadvantages as much as possible. Unfortunately, the hybrid\nmemory design space is very large and complex due to the existence of very\ndifferent types of NVMs and their rapidly-changing characteristics. Therefore,\noptimization of performance and lifetime of hybrid memory based computing\nplatforms and their experimental evaluation using traditional simulation\nmethods can be very time-consuming and sometimes even impractical. As such, it\nis necessary to develop a fast and flexible analytical model to estimate the\nperformance and lifetime of hybrid memories on various workloads. This paper\npresents an analytical model for hybrid memories based on Markov decision\nprocesses. The proposed model estimates the hit ratio and lifetime for various\nconfigurations of DRAM-NVM hybrid main memories. Our model also provides\naccurate estimation of the effect of data migration policies on the hybrid\nmemory hit ratio, one of the most important factors in hybrid memory\nperformance and lifetime. Such an analytical model can aid designers to tune\nhybrid memory configurations to improve performance and/or lifetime. We present\nseveral optimizations that make our model more efficient while maintaining its\naccuracy. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed model (a)\naccurately predicts the hybrid memory hit ratio with an average error of 4.61%\non a commodity server, (b) accurately estimates the NVM lifetime with an\naverage error of 2.93%, and (c) is on average 4x faster than conventional\nstate-of-the-art simulation platforms for hybrid memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 22:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

Device-to-Device (D2D) caching networks tackle this problem\nby exploiting user's behavior predictability and the possibility of sharing\ndata between them to alleviate the network congestion. However, capturing\nmobility statistics allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance their caching\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce a mobility-aware D2D caching network\nwhere SP harnesses user demand and mobility statistics to minimize the incurred\nservice cost through an optimal caching policy. We investigate two caching\nschemes: centralized and decentralized caching schemes. In the centralized\ncaching scheme, SP makes the caching decision towards its cost minimization to\nincrease its profit. However, the complexity of optimal caching policy grows\nexponentially with the number of users. Therefore, we discuss a greedy caching\nalgorithm which has a polynomial order complexity. We also use this greedy\nalgorithm to establish upper and lower bounds on the proactive service gain\nachieved by the optimal caching policy. In the decentralized caching scheme,\nusers take over and make their caching decisions, in a distributed fashion\naffected by the SP pricing policy, towards their payment minimization. We\nformulated the tension between the SP and users as a Stackelberg game. The Best\nresponse analysis was used to identify a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium\n(SPNE) between users. The optimal solution of proposed model was found to\ndepend on the SP reward preference, which affects the assigned memory in users'\ndevices. We found some regimes for the reward value where the SPNE was\nnon-unique. A fair allocation caching policy was adopted to choose one of these\nSPNEs.

Without considering the uneven distribution of\ninformation in the corrupted images, previous methods are restricted by local\nconvolutional operation and equal treatment of spatial- and channel-wise\nfeatures. To address this issue, we design local and non-local attention blocks\nto extract features that capture the long-range dependencies between pixels and\npay more attention to the challenging parts. Specifically, we design trunk\nbranch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The\ntrunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask\nbranches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with mixed\nattentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with\nconvolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about\nlong-range dependencies in the whole feature map. Furthermore, we propose\nresidual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network,\nwhich further enhance the representation ability of the network. Our proposed\nmethod can be generalized for various image restoration applications, such as\nimage denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and\nsuper-resolution.

The exact geostrophic\nstreamfunction for neutral surfaces is derived here. It involves a path\nintegral of the specific volume along a neutral trajectory. On a neutral\nsurface, the specific volume is a multivalued function of the pressure on the\nsurface, $\\underset{\\sim}{p}$. By decomposing the neutral surface into regions\nwhere the specific volume is a single-valued function of $\\underset{\\sim}{p}$,\nthe path integral is simply a sum of integrals of these single-valued\nfunctions. The regions are determined by the Reeb graph of\n$\\underset{\\sim}{p}$, and the neutral trajectory is encoded by a walk on this\ngraph. Islands, and other holes in the neutral surface, can create cycles in\nthe Reeb graph, causing the exact geostrophic streamfunction on a neutral\nsurface to be multivalued. Moreover, neutral surfaces are ill-defined in the\nreal ocean. Hence, the topobaric geostrophic streamfunction is presented: a\nsingle-valued approximation of the exact geostrophic streamfunction for neutral\nsurfaces, for use on any well-defined, approximately neutral surface. Numerical\ntests on several approximately neutral surfaces reveal that the topobaric\ngeostrophic streamfunction estimates the geostrophic velocity with an error\nthat is about an order of magnitude smaller than that for any previously known\ngeostrophic streamfunction. Also, the Montgomery potential is generalized,\nleading to an alternate form of the exact geostrophic streamfunction for\nneutral surfaces. This form is used to construct the orthobaric Montgomery\npotential, an easily computable geostrophic streamfunction that estimates the\ngeostrophic velocity more accurately than any previously known geostrophic\nstreamfunction, but less so than the topobaric geostrophic streamfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 01:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

These hybridized bands are\nanalogous to the carbon $p$-band effect that produces superconductivity in\nintercalated graphite with alkali and alkaline-earth metals. Furthermore, since\nthe bands are hybridized with the TM $d$-bands, their magnetic properties may\nprovide bosonic modes from their spin-coupling to preserve the unique linear\ndispersion present in monolayer graphene. This study provides a designing route\nby using TMs for tuning magneto-electric Dirac materials and will encourage\nfuture experimental studies to further the fundamental knowledge of\nunconventional superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 03:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

The morphology of type\nII terminals is characterized by the large number of en passant boutons. The\nlack of both scaled up DCV transport and scaled down DCV capture in boutons\nresults in a less efficient supply of DCVs to distal boutons. Furthermore, the\nlarge number of boutons that DCVs pass as they move anterogradely, until they\nreach the most distal bouton, may lead to the capture of a majority of DCVs\nbefore they turn around in the most distal bouton to move in the retrograde\ndirection. This may lead to a reduced retrograde flux of DCVs and a lack of DCV\ncirculation in type II terminals. The developed model simulates DCV\nconcentrations in boutons, DCV fluxes between the boutons, age density\ndistributions of DCVs, and the mean age of DCVs in various boutons. Unlike\npublished experimental observations, our model predicts DCV circulation in type\nII terminals after these terminals are filled to saturation. This disagreement\nis likely because experimentally observed terminals were not at steady-state,\nbut rather were accumulating DCVs for later release. Our estimates show that\nthe number of DCVs in the transiting state is much smaller than that in the\nresident state. DCVs traveling in the axon, rather than DCVs transiting in the\nterminal, may provide a reserve of DCVs for replenishing boutons after a\nrelease. The techniques for modeling transport of DCVs developed in our paper\ncan be used to model the transport of other organelles in axons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 03:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 17:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 14:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 18:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

The locality plays an important role in\nminimizing the nonlinear local domain discrepancy underlying the marginal\ndistributions. For better exploiting the domain locality, a novel local\ngenerative discrepancy metric (LGDM) based intermediate domain generation\nlearning called Manifold Criterion guided Transfer Learning (MCTL) is proposed\nin this paper. The merits of the proposed MCTL are four-fold: 1) the concept of\nmanifold criterion (MC) is first proposed as a measure validating the\ndistribution matching across domains, and domain adaptation is achieved if the\nMC is satisfied; 2) the proposed MC can well guide the generation of the\nintermediate domain sharing similar distribution with the target domain, by\nminimizing the local domain discrepancy; 3) a global generative discrepancy\nmetric (GGDM) is presented, such that both the global and local discrepancy can\nbe effectively and positively reduced; 4) a simplified version of MCTL called\nMCTL-S is presented under a perfect domain generation assumption for more\ngeneric learning scenario.

SNRs produce multi-wavelength, non-thermal emission\nvia accelerated particles at collisionless shocks generated by the interactions\nbetween the SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM). Although it is\nexpected that the rich diversities observed in supernovae (SNe) and their CSM\ncan result in distinct very-high-energy (VHE) electromagnetic signals in the\nSNR phase, there are only a handful of SNRs observed in both GeV and TeV\ngamma-rays so far. A systematic understanding of particle acceleration at SNRs\nin different ambient environments is therefore limited. Here, we explore\nnon-thermal emission from SNRs in various circumstellar environments up to 5000\nyrs from explosion using hydrodynamical simulations coupled with efficient\nparticle acceleration. We find that time-evolution of emission characteristics\nin the VHE regime is mainly dictated by two factors; the number density of the\ntarget particles and the amplified magnetic field in the shocked medium. We\nalso predict that Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will have a sufficient\nsensitivity to detect VHE gamma-rays from most young SNRs at distances <~ 5.0\nkpc.

Capital assets, such as wind turbines in a wind park, require\nmaintenance throughout their long lifetimes. Two types of preventive\nmaintenance are considered: planned maintenance at periodic, scheduled\nopportunities, and opportunistic maintenance at unscheduled opportunities. The\nlatter type of maintenance arises due to the network context: when an asset in\nthe network fails, this constitutes an opportunity for preventive maintenance\nfor the other assets in the network.\n  So as to increase the realism of the model at hand and its applicability to\nvarious sectors, we consider the option of not-deferring and of deferring\nplanned maintenance after the occurrence of opportunistic maintenance. We also\nassume that preventive maintenance may not always restore the condition of the\nsystem to `as good as new'.

To address this threat, we propose a novel fixed region\nbeamforming (FRB) by employing a frequency diverse subarray (FDSA) architecture\nto enhance the PLS performance for mmWave directional communications. In\nparticular, we carefully introduce multiple frequency offset increments (FOIs)\nacross subarrays to achieve a sophisticated beampattern synthesis that ensures\na confined information transmission only within the desired angle-range region\n(DARR) in close vicinity of the target user.

By using the proposed FRB, the mainlobes of all subarrays are\nconstructively superimposed in the DARR while the sidelobes are destructively\noverlayed outside the DARR. Therefore, FRB takes prominent effect on confining\ninformation transmission within the DARR.

We use the coherent parity check (CPC)\nframework to derive an Ising model mapping of the quantum error correction\ndecoding problem for an uncorrelated quantum error model. A specific advantage\nof our Ising model mapping is that it is compatible with maximum entropy\ninference techniques which can outperform maximum likelihood decoding in some\ncircumstances. We use numerical calculations within our framework to\ndemonstrate that maximum entropy decoding can not only lead to improved error\nsuppression, but can also shift threshold values for simple codes. As a high\nvalue problem for which a small advantage can lead to major gains, we argue\nthat decoding quantum codes is an ideal use case for quantum annealers. In\naddition, the structure of quantum error correction codes allows application\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC) annealing hardware to reduce embedding\ncosts, a major bottleneck in quantum annealing.

We propose\nprimitives for users to effectively define groups for differently sized data\nsets, and based on these, an automated grouping method using only the time\nseries dimensions. We propose algorithms for executing simple and\nmulti-dimensional aggregate queries on models. Last, we implement our methods\nin the Time Series Management System (TSMS) ModelarDB (ModelarDB+). Our\nevaluation shows that compared to widely used formats, ModelarDB+ provides up\nto 13.7 times faster ingestion due to high compression, 113 times better\ncompression due to the adaptivity of GOLEMM, 630 times faster aggregates by\nusing models, and close to linear scalability. It is also extensible and\nsupports online query processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 12:31:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 13:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

These models ultimately depend on the perceived stimulus values,\nwhile there is biological evidence that animals also use the temporal changes\nin the stimulus as information source for taxis behaviour. The time evolution\nof the stimulus values depends on the agent's (animal or robot) velocity, while\nsimultaneously the velocity is typically the variable to control. This circular\ndependency appears, for instance, when using optical flow to control the motion\nof a robot, and it is solved by fixing the forward speed while controlling only\nthe steering rate. This paper presents a new mathematical model of a\nbio-inspired source seeking controller that includes the rate of change of the\nstimulus in the velocity control mechanism. The above mentioned circular\ndependency results in a closed-loop model represented by a set of\ndifferential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which can be converted to non-linear\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) under some assumptions. Theoretical\nresults of the model analysis show that including a term dependent on the\ntemporal evolution of the stimulus improves the behaviour of the closed-loop\nsystem compared to simply using the stimulus values.

This implies that the\ntechnique is solely influenced by the non-linear parts of the drifts. This work\nprovides a description of the principle behind the GAMOR methodology and\nexplicates the background to its unique property. Based on simple models of the\ndrifts of the temperature in the cavity spacer and the residual gas in the\nreference cavity, this work predicts that a GAMOR system, when used for\nassessment of refractivity, can sustain significant temperature drifts and\nleakage rates without being affected by noticeable errors or uncertainties. The\ncavity spacer can be exposed to temperature fluctuations of 100 mK over 103 s,\nand the reference cavity can have a leakage that fills it up with gas on a\ntimescale of days, without providing errors or uncertainties in the assessment\nof refractivity that are 3 x 10^(-12), which, for N2, corresponds to 0.01 ppm\n(parts per million) of the value under atmospheric pressure conditions, and\nthereby 1 mPa.

The\nanalysis of the NSE data was performed by applying a Bayesian approach to the\ndescription of time correlation function decays in terms of exponential terms,\nrecently proved to be theoretically rigorous. This approach, which addresses in\na direct way the fundamental issue of model choice in any dynamical analysis,\nprovides here a guide to the most statistically supported way to follow the\ndecay of the Intermediate Scattering Functions I(Q, t) by basing on statistical\ngrounds the choice of the number of terms required for the description of the\nnanosecond dynamics of the studied systems. Then, the presented analysis avoids\nfrom the start resorting to a pre-selected framework and can be considered as\nmodel free. By comparing the results of PEG coated nanoparticles with those\nobtained in PEG2000 solutions, we were able to disentangle the translational\ndiffusion of the nanoparticles from the internal dynamics of the polymer\ngrafted to them, and to show that the polymer corona relaxation follows a pure\nexponential decay in agreement with the behavior predicted by coarse grained\nmolecular dynamics simulations and theoretical models. This methodology has one\nfurther advantage: in the presence of a complex dynamical scenario I(Q,t) is\noften described in terms of the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function that can\nimplicitly represent a distribution of relaxation times. By choosing to\ndescribe the I(Q,t) as a sum of exponential functions and with the support of\nthe Bayesian approach, we can explicitly determine when a finer-structure\nanalysis of the dynamical complexity of the system exists according to the\navailable data without the risk of overparametrisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 13:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

While the seminal work by\nBrunton et al. reported proof-of-concepts for idealized observation setting for\nfully-observed systems, {\\em i.e.} large signal-to-noise ratios and\nhigh-frequency sampling of all system variables, we here address the learning\nof data-driven representations of chaotic dynamics for partially-observed\nsystems, including significant noise patterns and possibly lower and irregular\nsampling setting. Instead of considering training losses based on short-term\nprediction error like state-of-the-art learning-based schemes, we adopt a\nBayesian formulation and state this issue as a data assimilation problem with\nunknown model parameters. To solve for the joint inference of the hidden\ndynamics and of model parameters, we combine neural-network representations and\nstate-of-the-art assimilation schemes. Using iterative Expectation-Maximization\n(EM)-like procedures, the key feature of the proposed inference schemes is the\nderivation of the posterior of the hidden dynamics. Using a\nneural-network-based Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) representation of\nthese dynamics, we investigate two strategies: their combination to Ensemble\nKalman Smoothers and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based variational\napproximations of the posterior. Through numerical experiments on the Lorenz-63\nsystem with different noise and time sampling settings, we demonstrate the\nability of the proposed schemes to recover and reproduce the hidden chaotic\ndynamics, including their Lyapunov characteristic exponents, when classic\nmachine learning approaches fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 14:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

Here we test the role of these\nnoncovalent crosslinks in the nonlinear rheology of reconstituted networks of\nthe intermediate filament protein vimentin, probing their stress- and rate-\ndependent mechanics. Similarly to previous studies we observe elastic\nstress-stiffening but unlike previous work we identify a characteristic yield\nstress $\\sigma^*$, above which the networks exhibit rate-dependent softening of\nthe network, referred to as $\\textit{inelastic fluidization}$. By investigating\nnetworks formed from tail-truncated vimentin, in which noncovalent crosslinking\nis suppressed, and glutaraldehyde-treated vimentin, in which crosslinking is\nmade permanent, we show that rate-dependent inelastic fluidization is a direct\nconsequence of vimentin's transient crosslinking. Surprisingly, although the\ntail-tail crosslinks are individually weak, the effective timescale for stress\nrelaxation of the network exceeds 1000s at $\\sigma^*$. Vimentin networks can\ntherefore maintain their integrity over a large range of strains (up to\n~1000\\%) and loading rates (10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{3}s^{-1}$). Our results provide\ninsight into how the hierarchical structure of vimentin networks contributes to\nthe cell's ability to be deformable yet strong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 15:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

The problem is tackled numerically by means of a\nsimple model where particles are modelled as a second fluid, that interacts\nwith the fluid phase through a two-way Stokes drag only. The transient growth\nis found to be enhanced by the presence of particles, especially so if the\nparticles are localised at a specific radial location of the pipe. At the same\ntime, the mechanisms of transient growth themselves remain those of\nnon-particulate flows. The effect is maximised for particles of intermediate\nsize (somewhere between the ballistic limit of very light particles and the\npoint where they are too heavy to be influenced by the flow).

The initial compression of the target pellet can be eliminated or\ndecreased, not to reach instabilities. A final and more energetic laser pulse\ncan achieve rapid volume ignition, which should be as short as the penetration\ntime of the light across the target. In the present study, we discuss a flat\nfuel target irradiated from both sides simultaneously.

The reflectivity of the target can be made\nnegligible, and the absorptivity can be increased by one or two orders of\nmagnitude by plasmonic nano-shells embedded in the target fuel. Thus, higher\nignition temperature and radiation dominated dynamics can be achieved.

This graph structure\nencoding feature relationships is the key distinctive aspect of NSP compared to\nclassical supervised learning. NSP arises in various applications: gene\nexpression samples embedded in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network,\ntemporal snapshots of infrastructure or sensor networks, and fMRI coherence\nnetwork samples from multiple subjects to name a few. Instances from these\ndomains are typically ``wide'' (more features than samples), and thus, feature\nsub-selection is required for robust and generalizable prediction. How to best\nemploy the network structure in order to learn succinct connected subgraphs\nencompassing the most discriminative features becomes a central challenge in\nNSP. Prior work employs connected subgraph sampling or graph smoothing within\noptimization frameworks, resulting in either large variance of quality or weak\ncontrol over the connectivity of selected subgraphs.\n  In this work we propose an optimization framework for discriminative subgraph\nlearning (DSL) which simultaneously enforces (i) sparsity, (ii) connectivity\nand (iii) high discriminative power of the resulting subgraphs of features. Our\noptimization algorithm is a single-step solution for the NSP and the associated\nfeature selection problem. It is rooted in the rich literature on\nmaximal-margin optimization, spectral graph methods and sparse subspace\nself-representation. DSL simultaneously ensures solution interpretability and\nsuperior predictive power (up to 16% improvement in challenging instances\ncompared to baselines), with execution times up to an hour for large instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 16:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Two commonly-discussed dispersion\nrelations are the gapless phonon-like DR and the DR with the energy or\nfrequency gap. More recently, the third and intriguing type of DR has been\nemerging in different areas of physics: the DR with the gap in momentum, or\n$k$-space. It has been increasingly appreciated that gapped momentum states\n(GMS) have important implications for dynamical and thermodynamic properties of\nthe system. Here, we review the origin of this phenomenon in a range of\nphysical systems, starting from ordinary liquids to holographic models. We\nobserve how GMS emerge in the Maxwell-Frenkel approach to liquid\nviscoelasticity, relate the $k$-gap to dissipation and observe how the gaps in\nDR can continuously change from the energy to momentum space and vice versa. We\nsubsequently discuss how GMS emerge in the two-field description which is\nanalogous to the quantum formulation of dissipation in the Keldysh-Schwinger\napproach. We discuss experimental evidence for GMS, including the direct\nevidence of gapped DR coming from strongly-coupled plasma. We also discuss GMS\nin electromagnetic waves and non-linear Sine-Gordon model. We then move on to\ndiscuss the recently developed quasihydrodynamic framework which relates the\n$k$-gap with the presence of a softly broken global symmetry and its\napplications. Finally, we review recent discussions of GMS in relativistic\nhydrodynamics and holographic models. Throughout the review, we point out\nessential physical ingredients required by GMS to emerge and make links between\ndifferent areas of physics, with the view that new and deeper understanding\nwill benefit from studying the GMS in seemingly disparate fields and from\nclarifying the origin of potentially similar underlying physical ideas and\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 15:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 21:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

For this, we study a vibronically coupled dimer and\ncalculate the nonlinear two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra which directly\nreveal electronic coherence. The timescale of electronic coherence is initially\nextracted by measuring the anti-diagonal bandwidth of the central peak in the\n2D spectrum at zero waiting time.

Ensuring the quality and\ncorrectness of software is challenging because each program has different\nconfigurations and input domains. To ensure the quality of software, all\npossible configurations and input combinations need to be evaluated against\ntheir expected outputs. However, this exhaustive test is impractical because of\ntime and resource constraints due to the large domain of input and\nconfigurations. Thus, different sampling techniques have been used to sample\nthese input domains and configurations. Objective: Combinatorial testing can be\nused to effectively detect faults in software-under-test. This technique uses\ncombinatorial optimization concepts to systematically minimize the number of\ntest cases by considering the combinations of inputs.
