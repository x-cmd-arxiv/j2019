If the Stokes number is as large as unity, the\npolarization vectors show a leading spiral pattern since the radial and\nazimuthal components of the gas velocity against the dust grains are\ncomparable. This suggests that if the observed polarization vectors show a\nleading spiral pattern, it would indicate that Stokes number of dust grains is\naround unity, which is presumably radially drifting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 16:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

In this work, we analyze\nthe state transfer efficiency problem for different class of quantum channels,\nincluding unitary, mixed unitary and Markovian.

An adaptive finite\nelement algorithm is proposed to solve the elastic obstacle scattering problem,\nwhere the truncation parameter is determined through the truncation error and\nthe mesh elements for local refinements are chosen through the finite element\ndiscretization error. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 18:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

In this work, we study dust settling\nin protoplanetary discs with hydrodynamic turbulence sustained by the vertical\nshear instability. We perform axisymmetric numerical simulations to investigate\nthe effect of turbulence, particle size, and solid abundance or metallicity on\ndust settling.

Given a static underlying graph $G=(V,E)$, a\ntemporal graph on $G$ is a sequence of snapshots $G_t$, one for each time step\n$t\\geq 1$. In this paper we study stochastic temporal graphs, i.e. stochastic\nprocesses $\\mathcal{G}$ whose random variables are the snapshots of a temporal\ngraph on $G$. A natural feature observed in various real-life scenarios is a\nmemory effect in the appearance probabilities of particular edges; i.e. the\nprobability an edge $e\\in E$ appears at time step $t$ depends on its appearance\n(or absence) at the previous $k$ steps.

Clearly, for every $k\\geq 1$, memory-$(k-1)$ is a\nspecial case of memory-$k$.

Adapting this\ntherapy to adults requires to scale the administered dose to the patient body\nweight and to in-crease the lipid concentration, whilst maintaining its surface\nand flow properties similar. Here, we exploit a magnetic wire-based\nmicrorheology technique to measure the viscosity of the exogenous pulmonary\nsurfactant Curosurf in various experimental conditions.

The X-ray\nproperties of LMXBs show strong variability over timescales ranging from\nmilliseconds to decades, much of which is tied to the extreme environment of\nthe inner accretion disk, hence an understanding of this behaviour is key to\nunderstanding how matter behaves in such an environment. GRS 1915+105 and MXB\n1730-335 are two LMXBs which show particularly unusual variability. GRS\n1915+105 shows a large number of distinct classes of second-to-minute scale\nvariability, consisting of repeated patterns of dips and flares. MXB 1730 shows\nType II X-ray Bursts; minute-scale increases in X-ray intensity with a sudden\nonset and a slow decay. More recently two new objects, IGR J17091-3624 and GRO\nJ1744-28 have been shown to display similar behaviours. In this thesis I\npresent a new framework with which to classify variability in IGR J17091. I\nperform a comparison study between this source and GRS 1915. In GRS 1915, hard\nX-rays lag soft X-rays in all variability classes; in IGR J17091, I find that\nthe sign of this lag varies between variability classes. Additionally, while\nGRS 1915+105 accretes at close to its Eddington Limit, I find that IGR\nJ17091-3624 accretes at only ~5-33% of its Eddington Limit. I also perform a\nstudy of variability in GRO J1744 and find that it is more complex than in MXB\n1730, consisting of at least 4 separate phenomena which may have separate\nphysical origins. One of these phenomena, `Structured Bursting', consists of\npatterns of flares and dips similar to those seen in GRS 1915 and IGR J17091. I\ncompare these types of variability and discuss the possibility of a physical\nlink. I also present the alternative hypothesis that Structured Bursting is\ncaused my 'hiccup accretion' similar to that seen in systems approaching the\npropeller regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 21:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 19:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

However,\nespecially in urban settings, mmWave signal propagation is sensitive to\nblockage by surrounding objects, resulting in significant signal attenuation.\nOne approach to mitigate the effect of attenuation is through multi-hop\ncommunication with the help of relays. Leveraging the unique characteristics of\nthe mmWave medium, we consider a single-source/destination $2$-hop system,\nwhere a cluster of spatially distributed and reconfigurable relays is used to\ncooperatively amplify-and-forward the source signal to the destination. Our\nsystem evolves in time slots, during which not only are optimal beamforming\nweights centrally determined, but also future relay positions for the\nsubsequent time slot are optimally selected, jointly maximizing the expected\nsignal-to-interference+noise ratio at the destination. Optimal predictive relay\npositioning is achieved by formulating a 2-stage stochastic programming\nproblem, which is efficiently approximated via a conditional\nsample-average-approximation surrogate, and solved in a purely distributed\nfashion across relays. The efficacy of the proposed near-optimal positioning\npolicy is corroborated by comparison against a randomized relay positioning\npolicy, clearly confirming its superiority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 22:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 22:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

Specifically, the task it to compute routes\nfor the vehicles (both customer-carrying and empty travelling) so that travel\ndemand is fulfilled and operational cost is minimized. The routing process must\naccount for congestion effects affecting travel times, as modeled via a\nvolume-delay function (VDF). Route planning with VDF constraints is notoriously\nchallenging, as such constraints compound the combinatorial complexity of the\nrouting optimization process. Thus, current solutions for AMoD routing resort\nto relaxations of the congestion constraints, thereby trading optimality with\ncomputational efficiency.

Such a reduction\nallows us to extend powerful algorithmic tools for traffic assignment, which\ncombine the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm with modern techniques for\npathfinding, to the AMoD routing problem.

CPU-centric model of computation has a huge number of\ndrawbacks that originate from memory hierarchy and obsolete architecture of the\ncomputing core. The concept of mixing memory and logic has been around since\n1960s. However, the concept of Processor-In-Memory (PIM) is unable to resolve\nthe critical issues of the CPU-centric computing model because of inevitable\nreplication of von Neumann architecture's drawbacks. The next generation of\nNVM/SCM memory is able to give the second birth to the data-centric computing\nparadigm.

All necessary PU's registers can\nbe implemented in the space of NVM memory. NVM memory of DPU is the single\nspace for storing and transformation of data. In the basis of PiNVSM\narchitecture lies the DPU array is able to overcome the limitations as Turing\nmachine model as von Neumann architecture. The DPU array hasn't a centralized\ncomputing core.

Any complex\ndata structure can be split on elementary items that can be stored into\nindependent DPU with dedicated computing core(s). One DPU is able to apply the\nelementary transformation on one item. But the DPU array is able to make the\ntransformation of complex structure by means of concurrent execution of\nelementary transformations in different DPUs. The PiNVSM architecture suggests\na principally new architecture of the computing core that creates a new\nopportunity for data self-organization, data and code synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 23:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

Such\nmodels lead to quintessential inflation within the poles when featuring an\nexponential potential. However, beyond the poles, we discover a novel\nbehaviour: the scalar field responsible for the early-time acceleration of the\nUniverse may reach the boundary of the field-space manifold, indicating that\nthe theory is incomplete and that a boundary condition must be imposed in order\nto determine its late-time behaviour. If the evolution of the field is arrested\nbefore this happens, however, we discover that quintessence can be achieved\nwithout a potential offset.

This suggests the warmer climate on high\nobliquity planets does not rely completely on the existence of ice, and\ntherefore holds at high insolation.

A\nparticular feature was to exploit the Lie symmetry invariance algebra of the\nsource, without integrating its equations, to facilitate MapDE, making\nalgorithmic an approach initiated by Bluman and Kumei. In applications,\nhowever, the explicit form of a target DPS is not available, and a more\nimportant question is, can the source be mapped to a more tractable class. This\naspect was illustrated by giving an algorithm to determine the existence of a\nmapping of a linear differential equation to the class of constant coefficient\nlinear differential equations, again algorithmically realizing a method of\nBluman and Kumei. Key for this application was the exploitation of a\ncommutative sub-algebra of symmetries corresponding to translations of the\nindependent variables in the target.

It needs to be accounted for as a surface material, distinct from\nPluto's icy bedrock and from the volatile ices that migrate via sublimation and\ncondensation on seasonal timescales. This paper explores how a steady supply of\natmospheric haze might affect three distinct provinces on Pluto. We pose the\nquestion of why they each look so different from one another if the same haze\nmaterial is settling out onto all of them. Cthulhu is a more ancient region\nwith comparatively little present-day geological activity, where the haze\nappears to simply accumulate over time. Sputnik Planitia is a very active\nregion where glacial convection, as well as sublimation and condensation\nrapidly refresh the surface, hiding recently deposited haze from view. Lowell\nRegio is a region of intermediate age featuring very distinct coloration from\nthe rest of Pluto. Using a simple model haze particle as a colorant, we are not\nable to match the colors in both Lowell Regio and Cthulhu. To account for their\ndistinct colors, we propose that after arrival at Pluto's surface, haze\nparticles may be less inert than might be supposed from the low surface\ntemperatures. They must either interact with local materials and environments\nto produce distinct products in different regions, or else the supply of haze\nmust be non-uniform in time and/or location, such that different products are\ndelivered to different places.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 03:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

These\nmechanisms can give rise to fields which could be strong, but often with much\nsmaller coherence scales than galactic scales.

Basic ideas behind both small and\nlarge-scale turbulent dynamos are outlined.

These texts can be\n``comparative'' since they may be semantically correlated and thus provide us\nwith different perspectives toward the same topics or events. To better\norganize the multi-sourced texts and obtain more comprehensive knowledge, we\npropose to study the novel problem of Mutual Clustering on Comparative Texts\n(MCCT), which aims to cluster the comparative texts simultaneously and\ncollaboratively. The MCCT problem is difficult to address because 1)\ncomparative texts usually present different data formats and structures and\nthus they are hard to organize, and 2) there lacks an effective method to\nconnect the semantically correlated comparative texts to facilitate clustering\nthem in an unified way. To this aim, in this paper we propose a Heterogeneous\nInformation Network-based Text clustering framework HINT. HINT first models\nmulti-sourced texts (e.g. news and tweets) as heterogeneous information\nnetworks by introducing the shared ``anchor texts'' to connect the comparative\ntexts. Next, two similarity matrices based on HINT as well as a transition\nmatrix for cross-text-source knowledge transfer are constructed. Comparative\ntexts clustering are then conducted by utilizing the constructed matrices.\nFinally, a mutual clustering algorithm is also proposed to further unify the\nseparate clustering results of the comparative texts by introducing a\nclustering consistency constraint. We conduct extensive experimental on three\ntweets-news datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed method in addressing the MCCT problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 08:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

And then, to put\nboth triples and mined logic rules within the same semantic space, all triples\nin the knowledge graph are represented as first-order logic. Finally, we define\nseveral operations on the first-order logic and minimize a global loss over\nboth of the mined logic rules and the transformed first-order logics. We\nconduct extensive experiments for link prediction and triple classification on\nthree datasets: WN18, FB166, and FB15K. Experiments show that the rule-enhanced\nmethod can significantly improve the performance of several baselines. The\nhighlight of our model is that the filtered Hits@1, which is a pivotal\nevaluation in the knowledge inference task, has a significant improvement (up\nto 700% improvement).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 10:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

In this work, authors\nformulate an optimal control problem to describe the behaviour of controlling\nthe time-variant inertia from storage, and structure preserving model is\nutilized to describe the dynamics of system, where frequencies of all buses are\npreserved. Also, practical constraints such as frequency contraints for buses,\npower/energy constraints for storage are incorporated in the optimal control\nproblem. To solve this optimal control problem, dynamic programming (DP) and\nPROPT MATLAB Optimal Control Software are employed to obtain global optimal\nsolution (virtual inertia trajectory). The simulation results show the\ncorrectness and effectiveness of our problem formulation and solving method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 12:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Originally, QIF is defined as the average of leakage amount of secret\ninformation over all executions of a program. However, a vulnerable program\nthat has executions leaking the whole secret but has the small average leakage\ncould be considered as secure. This counter-intuition raises a need for a new\ndefinition of information leakage of a particular run, i.e., dynamic leakage.\nAs discussed in [5], entropy-based definitions do not work well for quantifying\ninformation leakage dynamically; Belief-based definition on the other hand is\nappropriate for deterministic programs, however, it is not appropriate for\nprobabilistic ones. In this paper, we propose new simple notions of dynamic\nleakage based on entropy which are compatible with existing QIF definitions for\ndeterministic programs, and yet reasonable for probabilistic programs in the\nsense of [5].

In contrast,\nstandard Solar models suggest the Sun was 25% less luminous at this ancient\nepoch, implying a cold, frozen planet-all else kept equal. This discrepancy,\nknown as the Faint Young Sun Paradox, remains unresolved. Most proposed\nsolutions invoke high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the early\natmosphere to offset for the fainter Sun, though current geological constraints\nare insufficient to verify or falsify these scenarios. In this work, we\nexamined several simple mechanisms that involve the role played by Earth's spin\nrate, which was significantly faster during Archean time. This faster spin rate\nenhances the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, facilitating a warm equator,\nwhile maintaining cold poles. Results show that such an enhanced meridional\ngradient augments the meridional gradient in carbonate deposition, which biases\nthe surviving geological record away from the global mean, toward warmer\nwaters. Moreover, using simple atmospheric models, we found that the\nfaster-spinning Earth was less sensitive to ice-albedo feedbacks, facilitating\nlarger meridional temperature gradients before succumbing to global glaciation.\nWe show that within the faster-spinning regime, the greenhouse warming required\nto generate an ice-free Earth can differ from that required to generate an\nEarth with permanent ice caps by the equivalent of 1-2 orders of magnitude of\npCO2. Accordingly, the resolution of the Faint Young Sun problem depends\nsignificantly on whether the early Earth was ever, or even at times, ice-free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 15:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Through numerical calculation, we confirm that the\nground state of such quantum system is an entangled state. This raises a\nquestion whether a quantum ground state describing masses interacting through\ngravity can ever be a separable state. Entanglement seems to be an intrinsic\ncharacteristic for the ground state when mutual gravitational interaction is\ninvolved. Although the study is in the context of non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics, it provides hints for a quantum gravity theory in the limit of very\nweak field and low relative velocity.

State-of-art QSM reconstruction methods either\nsuffer from image artifacts or long computation times, which limits QSM\nclinical translation efforts. To overcome these limitations, a\ndeep-learning-based approach is proposed and demonstrated. Methods: An\nencoder-decoder neural network was trained to infer susceptibility maps on\nvolume parcellated regions. The training data consisted of fabricated\nsusceptibility distributions modeled to mimic the spatial frequency patterns of\nin-vivo brain susceptibility distributions. Inferred volume parcels were\nrecombined to form composite QSM. This approach is denoted as ASPEN, standing\nfor Approximated Susceptibility through Parcellated Encoder-decoder Networks.\nASPEN performance was evaluated relative to several well-established approaches\non a gold-standard challenge dataset and on cohort of 200 study subjects.\nResults: ASPEN provided similar levels of quantitative accuracy compared to the\nevaluated established approaches on the gold standard ISMRM Challenge dataset,\nbut qualitatively showed marked reductions in streaking artifacts and map\nblurring. On the large-cohort dataset, ASPEN achieved the highest score\ncompared with other methods in a multi-rater evaluation of streaking artifacts\nand map resolution. Conclusion: The proposed ASPEN approach can robustly infer\nsusceptibility maps in near real-time on routine computational hardware.

Studies on computer simulations touch upon many different facets of\nscientific and engineering research and evoke philosophically inclined\nquestions of interpretation with close ties to problems in experimental\nsettings and engineering applications (...)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 15:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

To this end, two questions are answered: what is the\nexplanatory relation for computer simulations? and what kind of epistemic gain\nshould be expected? For several reasons tailored to the benefits and needs of\ncomputer simulations, these questions are better answered within the\nunificationist model of scientific explanation. Unlike previous efforts in the\nliterature, I submit that the explanatory relation is between the simulation\nmodel and the results of the simulation. I also argue that our epistemic gain\ngoes beyond the unificationist account, encompassing a practical dimension as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 09:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

A sintering process is usually\nneeded to make the printed inks conductive by removing the organic dispersants\nand allowing metal-to-metal contacts among nanoparticles for atomic diffusion\nand neck formation. It has been challenging to sinter silver nanoparticle inks\nin a thermal oven at a temperature < 150 C to avoid thermal damage to the\nplastic substrate while achieving desired conductivity. This work presents a\nsimple yet effective way to sinter a silver nanoparticle ink below 120 C (even\nat 80 C) by exposing the printed ink to water vapor in the oven. The results\nconsistently show a significant reduction of line resistivity for the samples\nsintered in a moist oven compared to those sintered in a dry oven. Hence,\nsolvent vapor-assisted sintering of metal nanoparticle inks can become an\nenabling approach to broaden product range of printed electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 14:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}
