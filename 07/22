We consider initial mid-plane\ngas to magnetic pressure ratios $\\beta_0 = 1000,\\, 300$ and $100$, spanning the\ntransition between weakly and strongly magnetized accretion regimes. We find\nthat magnetic pressure is important for the disks' vertical structure in all\nthree cases, with accretion occurring at $z/R\\approx 0.2$ in the two most\nstrongly magnetized models. The disk midplane shows outflow rather than\naccretion. Accretion through the surface layers is driven mainly by stress due\nto coherent large scale magnetic field rather than by turbulent stress.\nEquivalent viscosity parameters measured from our simulations show similar\ndependencies on initial $\\beta_0$ to those seen in shearing box simulations,\nthough the disk midplane is not magnetic pressure dominated even for the\nstrongest magnetic field case. Winds are present but are not the dominant\ndriver of disk evolution. Over the (limited) duration of our simulations, we\nfind evidence that the net flux attains a quasi-steady state at levels that can\nstably maintain a strongly magnetized disk. We suggest that geometrically thin\naccretion disks in observed systems may commonly exist in a magnetically\n\"elevated\" state, characterized by non-zero but modest vertical magnetic\nfluxes, with potentially important implications for disk phenomenology in X-ray\nbinaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 16:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 21:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

Water ice is known for its ability to trap\nCO and other volatile species. In this study we explore whether another common\ninterstellar and cometary ice component, CO2, is able to trap CO as well. We\nmeasure entrapment of CO molecules in CO2 ice through temperature programmed\ndesorption (TPD) experiments on CO2:CO ice mixtures.

However, when these\ntransitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or\naid manipulation---for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully\ninserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require\nlarge amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as\nproblem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different\nproblems. By contrast, hierarchical POMDP planning-based methods scale well via\nplan decomposition, work well on novel problems, and directly consider\nuncertainty, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task\ndecompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we\npropose a new method, MICAH, which given unsegmented data of an object's motion\nunder applied actions, (1) detects changepoints in the object motion model\nusing action-conditional inference, (2) estimates the individual local motion\nmodels with their parameters, and (3) converts them into a hybrid automaton\nthat is compatible with hierarchical POMDP planning. We show that model\nlearning under MICAH is more accurate and robust to noise than prior\napproaches. Further, we combine MICAH with a hierarchical POMDP planner to\ndemonstrate that the learned models are rich enough to be used for performing\nmanipulation tasks under uncertainty that require the objects to be used in\nnovel ways not encountered during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 18:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 18:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 19:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

The addition of polarimetry can help data\ninterpretation by resolving model-dependent degeneracies. The typical\ninstrument approach is that incident X-rays scatter off a plastic scintillator\ninto an adjacent scintillator cell. In all missions to date, the scintillators\nare read out using traditional vacuum tube photo-multipliers (PMTs). The advent\nof solid-state PMTs (\"silicon PM\" or \"MPPC\") is attractive for space-based\ninstruments since the devices are compact, robust and require a low bias\nvoltage. We have characterised the plastic scintillator, EJ-248M, optically\ncoupled to a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) and read out with the Citiroc\nASIC. A light-yield of 1.6 photoelectrons/keV has been obtained, with a low\nenergy detection threshold of $\\lesssim$5 keV at room temperature. We have also\nconstructed an MPPC-based polarimeter-demonstrator in order to investigate the\nfeasibility of such an approach for future instruments. Incident X-rays scatter\nfrom a plastic-scintillator bar to surrounding cerium-doped GAGG (Gadolinium\nAluminium Gallium Garnet) scintillators yielding time-coincident signals in the\nscintillators.

In addition to this, we show their effects on mass hierarchy and CP\nviolation sensitivities by considering NO$\\nu$A as a case study. We find that\nthe sensitivity limits on LIV parameters obtained from T2K are much weaker than\nthat of NO$\\nu$A and the synergy of T2K and NO$\\nu$A can improve these\nsensitivities. All these limits are slightly weaker ($2 \\sigma$ level) compared\nto the values extracted from Super-Kamiokande experiment with atmospheric\nneutrinos. Moreover, we observe that the mass hierarchy and CPV sensitivities\nare either enhanced or deteriorated significantly in the presence of LIV as\nthese sensitivities crucially depend on the new CP-violating phases. We also\npresent the correlation between $\\sin^2 \\theta_{23}$ and the LIV parameter\n$|a_{\\alpha \\beta}|$, as well as $\\delta_{CP}$ and $|a_{\\alpha \\beta}|$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 06:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

This misfit functional provides additional features compared\nto the more traditional least-squares approaches with, in particular, that the\nobservational and computational acquisitions can be different. Therefore, the\npositions and wavelets of the sources from which the measurements are acquired\nare not needed in the reconstruction procedure and, in fact, the numerical\nacquisition (for the simulations) can be arbitrarily chosen. Based on\nthree-dimensional experiments, FRgWI is shown to behave better than Full\nWaveform Inversion (FWI) in the same context. Then, it allows for arbitrary\nnumerical acquisitions in two ways: when few measurements are given, a dense\nnumerical acquisition (compared to the observational one) can be used to\ncompensate. On the other hand, with a dense observational acquisition, a sparse\ncomputational one is shown to be sufficient, for instance with multiple-point\nsources, hence reducing the numerical cost.

This version is capable of\nreproducing a wide range of dynamic responses.Results indicate the degree to\nwhich interactions are synergistic is crucial in determining sensitivity to\nforcing, particularly for the higher trophic levels, which can respond\nnon-linearly to stronger forcing. Stronger synergistic interactions sensitize\nthe system to variability in forcing, and combinations of stronger forcing,\nnoise and synergies between effects are particularly potent.

Such a situation arises\nin ad hoc team problems, a model of many practical multiagent systems\napplications.

Dedicated studies were performed to\nverify the feasibility of the calibration through muons on the relatively small\nsize of the primary mirror (~4 m diameter), as in the case of larger Cherenkov\ntelescopes. A number of tests were performed using simulations of the\natmospheric showers with the CORSIKA package and of the telescope response with\na dedicated simulator. In this contribution we present a preliminary analysis\nof muon events detected by ASTRI-Horn during the regular scientific data taking\nperformed in December 2018 and March 2019. These muon events validate the\nresults obtained with the simulations and definitively confirm the feasibility\nof calibrating the ASTRI-Horn SST telescope with muons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 09:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Close monitoring for early detection of abnormal\nsystem conditions is therefore required. Data-driven solutions to this problem\nhave been limited for two reasons: First, safety critical assets are designed\nand maintained to be highly reliable and faults are rare. Fault detection can\nthus not be solved with supervised learning. Second, complex industrial systems\nusually have long lifetime during which they face very different operating\nconditions. In the early life of the system, the collected data is probably not\nrepresentative of future operating conditions, making it challenging to train a\nrobust model.\n  In this paper, we propose a methodology to monitor the systems in their early\nlife.

The bandwidth of such intrinsic filtering of\ngenerated photons can be controlled by several geometrical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 10:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

We propose a novel geometry based algorithm for\naccurately estimating the head pose from a single 2D face image at a very low\ncomputational cost. Specifically, the rectangular coordinates of only four\nnon-coplanar feature points from a predefined 3D facial model as well as the\ncorresponding ones automatically/ manually extracted from a 2D face image are\nfirst normalized to exclude the effect of external factors (i.e., scale factor\nand translation parameters). Then, the four normalized 3D feature points are\nrepresented in spherical coordinates with reference to the uniquely determined\nsphere by themselves. Due to the spherical parameterization, the coordinates of\nfeature points can then be morphed along all the three directions in the\nrectangular coordinates effectively. Finally, the rotation matrix indicating\nthe head pose is obtained by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the\nnormalized 2D feature points and the 2D re-projections of morphed 3D feature\npoints. Comprehensive experimental results over two popular databases, i.e.,\nPointing'04 and Biwi Kinect, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can\nestimate head poses with higher accuracy and lower run time than\nstate-of-the-art geometry based methods. Even compared with start-of-the-art\nlearning based methods or geometry based methods with additional depth\ninformation, our algorithm still produces comparable performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 10:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 00:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 14:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

Our approach first learns offline a\nprobabilistic model that captures how certain code transforms are applied to\ncertain AST nodes, and then uses the learned model to predict transforms for\narbitrary new, unseen code snippets. {Our approach involves a novel\nrepresentation of both programs and code transforms. Specifically, we introduce\nthe formal framework for defining the so-called AST-level code transforms and\nwe demonstrate how the CRF model can be accordingly designed, learned, and used\nfor prediction}. We instantiate our approach in the context of repair transform\nprediction for Java programs. Our instantiation contains a set of carefully\ndesigned code features, deals with the training data imbalance issue, and\ncomprises transform constraints that are specific to code. We conduct a\nlarge-scale experimental evaluation based on a dataset of bug fixing commits\nfrom real-world Java projects. The results show that when the popular\nevaluation metric \\emph{top-3} is used, our approach predicts the code\ntransforms with an accuracy varying from 41\\% to 53\\% depending on the\ntransforms.

These events can be classified in three\ngroups (A1, A2 and A3) according to their spectral contents, and are thought to\nplay a role in the transitions between the different sleep stages. A-phase\ndetection and classification is usually performed manually by a trained expert,\nbut it is a tedious and time-consuming task. In the past two decades, various\nresearchers have designed algorithms to automatically detect and classify the\nA-phases with varying degrees of success, but the problem remains open. In this\npaper, a different approach is proposed: instead of attempting to design a\ngeneral classifier for all subjects, we propose to train ad-hoc classifiers for\neach subject using as little data as possible, in order to drastically reduce\nthe amount of time required from the expert. The proposed classifiers are based\non deep convolutional neural networks using the log-spectrogram of the EEG\nsignal as input data. Results are encouraging, achieving average accuracies of\n80.31% when discriminating between A-phases and non A-phases, and 71.87% when\nclassifying among A-phase sub-types, with only 25% of the total A-phases used\nfor training.

One\nmethod to solve reinforcement learning tasks is Neuroevolution, where neural\nnetworks are optimized by evolutionary algorithms. A disadvantage of\nNeuroevolution is that it can require numerous function evaluations, while not\nfully utilizing the available information from each fitness evaluation. This is\nespecially problematic when fitness evaluations become expensive. To reduce the\ncost of fitness evaluations, surrogate models can be employed to partially\nreplace the fitness function. The difficulty of surrogate modeling for\nNeuroevolution is the complex search space and how to compare different\nnetworks. To that end, recent studies showed that a kernel based approach,\nparticular with phenotypic distance measures, works well. These kernels compare\ndifferent networks via their behavior (phenotype) rather than their topology or\nencoding (genotype). In this work, we discuss the use of surrogate model-based\nNeuroevolution (SMB-NE) using a phenotypic distance for reinforcement learning.\nIn detail, we investigate a) the potential of SMB-NE with respect to evaluation\nefficiency and b) how to select adequate input sets for the phenotypic distance\nmeasure in a reinforcement learning problem.

We demonstrate that under equivalent conditions,\nwhere in a viscous disc convergent migration will form a long-term stable\nsystem of planets in a chain of mean motion resonances, migration in an\ninviscid disc often produces a system which is highly dynamically unstable. In\nparticular, if planets are massive enough to significantly perturb the disc\nsurface density and drive vortex formation, the smooth capture of planets into\nmean motion resonances is disrupted. As planets pile up in close orbits, not\nprotected by resonances, close encounters increase the probability of\nplanet-planet collisions, even while the gas disc is still present. While\ninviscid discs often produce unstable non-resonant systems, stable, closely\npacked, non-resonant systems can also be formed.

Our approach may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to\nbe applied to real-world applications where the suppression of background light\nand noise is important, such as imaging under low-photon flux and quantum\nLIDAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Traditional 3D / 4D medical image\nreconstruction requires near hundreds of projections, which cost insufferable\ncomputational time and deliver undesirable high imaging / radiation dose to\nhuman subjects. Moreover, it always needs further notorious processes to\nextract the accurate 3D organ models subsequently. To our knowledge, there is\nno method directly and explicitly reconstructing multiple 3D organ meshes from\na single 2D medical grayscale image on the fly. Given single-view 2D medical\nimages, e.g., 3D / 4D-CT projections or X-ray images, our end-to-end\nDeepOrganNet framework can efficiently and effectively reconstruct 3D / 4D lung\nmodels with a variety of geometric shapes by learning the smooth deformation\nfields from multiple templates based on a trivariate tensor-product deformation\ntechnique, leveraging an informative latent descriptor extracted from input 2D\nimages. The proposed method can guarantee to generate high-quality and\nhigh-fidelity manifold meshes for 3D / 4D lung models. The major contributions\nof this work are to accurately reconstruct the 3D organ shapes from 2D\nsingle-view projection, significantly improve the procedure time to allow\non-the-fly visualization, and dramatically reduce the imaging dose for human\nsubjects. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional\nreconstruction method and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using\nextensive 3D and 4D examples from synthetic phantom and real patient datasets.\nThe proposed method only needs several milliseconds to generate organ meshes\nwith 10K vertices, which has a great potential to be used in real-time image\nguided radiation therapy (IGRT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Unfortunately, the\ncurrent hardware permits measuring only a much more limited subset of operators\nthat share a common tensor product eigen-basis. We introduce unitary\ntransformations that transform any fully commuting group of operators to a\ngroup that can be measured on current hardware. These unitary operations can be\nencoded as a sequence of Clifford gates and let us not only measure much larger\ngroups of terms but also to obtain these groups efficiently on a classical\ncomputer. The problem of finding the minimum number of fully commuting groups\nof terms covering the whole Hamiltonian is found to be equivalent to the\nminimum clique cover problem for a graph representing Hamiltonian terms as\nvertices and commutativity between them as edges. Tested on few molecular\nelectronic Hamiltonians with up to 50 thousand terms, the introduced technique\nallows for the reduction of the number of separately measurable operator groups\ndown to few hundreds, thus achieving up to 2 orders of magnitude reduction.

The most widespread model for\nsuch situations of 'radical uncertainty' is in terms of imprecise\nprobabilities, i.e. representing the agent's knowledge as a set of probability\nmeasures. We add to this model a plausibility map, associating to each measure\na plausibility number, as a way to go beyond what is known with certainty and\nrepresent the agent's beliefs about probability. There are a number of standard\nexamples: Shannon Entropy, Centre of Mass etc. We then consider learning of two\ntypes of information: (1) learning by repeated sampling from the unknown\ndistribution (e.g. picking marbles from the bag); and (2) learning higher-order\ninformation about the distribution (in the shape of linear inequalities, e.g.\nwe are told there are more red marbles than green marbles). The first changes\nonly the plausibility map (via a 'plausibilistic' version of Bayes' Rule), but\nleaves the given set of measures unchanged; the second shrinks the set of\nmeasures, without changing their plausibility. Beliefs are defined as in Belief\nRevision Theory, in terms of truth in the most plausible worlds. But our belief\nchange does not comply with standard AGM axioms, since the revision induced by\n(1) is of a non-AGM type. This is essential, as it allows our agents to learn\nthe true probability: we prove that the beliefs obtained by repeated sampling\nconverge almost surely to the correct belief (in the true probability). We end\nby sketching the contours of a dynamic doxastic logic for statistical learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 03:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Given the most\ncommon definition of observables (having weakly vanishing Poisson bracket with\neach first-class constraint), observables are constants of the motion and\nnonlocal. Unfortunately this definition also implies that the observables for\nmassive electromagnetism with gauge freedom (Stueckelberg) are inequivalent to\nthose of massive electromagnetism without gauge freedom (Proca). The\nalternative Pons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables, aiming for\nHamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, uses the gauge generator G, a tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints, rather than each first-class constraint separately,\nand implies equivalent observables for equivalent massive electromagnetisms.\nFor General Relativity, G generates 4-dimensional Lie derivatives for\nsolutions. The Lie derivative compares different space-time points with the\nsame coordinate value in different coordinate systems, like 1 a.m. summer time\nvs. 1 a.m. standard time, so a vanishing Lie derivative implies constancy\nrather than covariance. Requiring equivalent observables for equivalent\nformulations of massive gravity confirms that $G$ must generate the\n$4$-dimensional Lie derivative (not $0$) for observables. These separate\nresults indicate that observables are invariant under internal gauge symmetries\nbut covariant under external gauge symmetries, but can this bifurcated\ndefinition work for mixed theories such as Einstein-Maxwell theory? Pons,\nSalisbury and Shepley have studied $G$ for Einstein-Yang-Mills. For\nEinstein-Maxwell, both $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are invariant under\nelectromagnetic gauge transformations and covariant (changing by a Lie\nderivative) under $4$-dimensional coordinate transformations. Using the\nbifurcated definition, these quantities count as observables, as one would\nexpect on non-Hamiltonian grounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 09:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

Specifically, Gradient Boosting Classifier was the best\nmodel, producing an AUC ROC of 0.911 (CI 95%, 0.911 to 0.912), a sensitivity of\n0.858 (CI 95%, 0.856 to 0.86) and a specificity of 0.807 (CI 95%, 0.806 to\n0808) and a BER of 0.168 (CI 95%, 0.167 to 0.169).\n  Conclusions: The analysis of common information at hospital admission\ncombined with machine learning techniques produced models with competitive\ndiscriminative power. Our models reach the best results reported in state of\nthe art. These results demonstrate that they can be used as an accurate\ndata-driven palliative care criteria inclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Yet, the nucleogenesis and chemical evolution of\nelements heavier than helium are dictated mostly by the physics of the stars\nand the shape of the stellar mass spectrum. In particular, estimates of CNO\nisotopic abundances in the hot, dusty media of high-redshift starburst galaxies\noffer a unique glimpse into the shape of the stellar initial mass function\n(IMF) in extreme environments that can not be accessed with direct observations\n(star counts). Underlying uncertainties in stellar evolution and\nnucleosynthesis theory, however, may hurt our chances of getting a firm grasp\nof the IMF in these galaxies. In this work, we adopt new yields for massive\nstars, covering different initial rotational velocities. First, we implement\nthe new yield set in a well-tested chemical evolution model for the Milky Way.\nThe calibrated model is then adapted to the specific case of a prototype\nsubmillimeter galaxy (SMG). We show that, if the formation of fast-rotating\nstars is favoured in the turbulent medium of violently star-forming galaxies\nirrespective of metallicity, the IMF needs to be skewed towards high-mass stars\nin order to explain the CNO isotope ratios observed in SMGs. If, instead,\nstellar rotation becomes negligible beyond a given metallicity threshold, as is\nthe case for our own Galaxy, there is no need to invoke a top-heavy IMF in\nstarbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 14:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In practice however, block sizes are\nfinite and observations from different blocks are dependent. Theory respecting\nthe latter complications is not well developed, and, in the multivariate case,\nhas only recently been established for disjoint blocks of a single block size.\nWe show that using overlapping blocks instead of disjoint blocks leads to a\nuniform improvement in the asymptotic variance of the multivariate empirical\ndistribution function of rescaled block maxima and any smooth functionals\nthereof (such as the empirical copula), without any sacrifice in the asymptotic\nbias. We further derive functional central limit theorems for multivariate\nempirical distribution functions and empirical copulas that are uniform in the\nblock size parameter, which seems to be the first result of this kind for\nestimators based on block maxima in general.

As different turbulent water flows were imposed, each\nheap evolved to a barchan dune, which was filmed with a high-speed camera. An\nimage processing code was written to identify some of the moving grains and\ncompute their velocity fields and trajectories. Our results show that the\nvelocity of grains varies along the barchan dune, with higher velocities\noccurring close to the dune centroid, and that grains trajectories are\nintermittent. Depending on the region over the dune, we found that the velocity\nfields present values within 1 and 10 % of the cross-sectional mean velocity of\nthe fluid. Considering the average trajectories of grains moving over a given\ndune, their mean displacement varies within 30 and 60 grain diameters and their\ncharacteristic velocities within 10 and 20 % of the cross-sectional mean\nvelocity of the fluid. The displacement time varies between 30 and 90 % of the\nsettling time, and it seems to have two asymptotic behaviors: one close to bed\nload inception and other far from it.

However, converting an\nexisting conventional diamond interchange (CDI) to a diverging one is a more\neffective way according to the simulation results. DDI improves the throughput\nof a CDI by 950 vehicles per hour, a near 20% improvement; whereas with full\npenetration of CAV, the throughput of a CDI is increased only by 300 vehicles\nper hour. A similar trend is observed in the average delay per vehicle as well.\nFurthermore, we assess the impact for the driver's confusion, a concern for\ndeploying AIDs, on the traffic flow.

The proposed resampler network generates content adaptive\nimage resampling kernels that are applied to the original HR input to generate\npixels on the downscaled image. Moreover, a differentiable upscaling (SR)\nmodule is employed to upscale the LR result into its underlying HR counterpart.\nBy back-propagating the reconstruction error down to the original HR input\nacross the entire framework to adjust model parameters, the proposed framework\nachieves a new state-of-the-art SR performance through upscaling guided image\nresamplers which adaptively preserve detailed information that is essential to\nthe upscaling.

Current\nstate-of-the-art object detectors are comprised of two stages: the first stage\ngenerates region proposals, the second stage subsequently categorizes them.\nUnlike in natural images, however, for anatomical structures of interest such\nas tumors, the appearance in the image (e.g., scale or intensity) links to a\nmalignancy grade that lies on a continuous ordinal scale. While classification\nmodels discard this ordinal relation between grades by discretizing the\ncontinuous scale to an unordered bag of categories, regression models are\ntrained with distance metrics, which preserve the relation. This advantage\nbecomes all the more important in the setting of label confusions on ambiguous\ndata sets, which is the usual case with medical images.
