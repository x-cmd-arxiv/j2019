Fluid\nMech., 767, p254). In the present study, a detailed investigation of the\nself-sustaining process of the energy-containing motions at each spanwise\nlength scale (i.e. the attached eddies) in the logarithmic and outer regions is\ncarried out with an emphasis on its relevance to 'bursting', which refers to an\nenergetic temporal oscillation of the motions (Flores & Jim\\'enez, 2010, Phys.\nFluids, 22, 071704). It is shown that the attached eddies in the logarithmic\nand outer regions, composed of streaks and quasi-streamwise vortical\nstructures, bear the self-sustaining process remarkably similar to that in the\nnear-wall region: i.e. the streaks are significantly amplified by the\nquasi-streamwise vortices via the lift-up effect; the amplified streaks\nsubsequently undergo a 'rapid streamwise meandering motion', reminiscent of\nstreak instability or transient growth, which eventually results in breakdown\nof the streaks and regeneration of new quasi-streamwise vortices. Two numerical\nexperiments, designed to artificially suppress the lift-up effect and the\nstreak meandering motions, respectively, reveal that these processes are\nessential ingredients of the self-sustaining process of the attached eddies in\nthe logarithmic and outer regions, consistent with several previous theoretical\nstudies.

During collaborative software development, developers often use\nbranches to add features or fix bugs. When merging changes from two branches,\nconflicts may occur if the changes are inconsistent. Developers need to resolve\nthese conflicts before completing the merge, which is an error-prone and\ntime-consuming process. Early detection of merge conflicts, which warns\ndevelopers about resolving conflicts before they become large and complicated,\nis among the ways of dealing with this problem. Existing techniques do this by\ncontinuously pulling and merging all combinations of branches in the background\nto notify developers as soon as a conflict occurs, which is a computationally\nexpensive process. One potential way for reducing this cost is to use a\nmachine-learning based conflict predictor that filters out the merge scenarios\nthat are not likely to have conflicts, ie safe merge scenarios. Aims. In this\npaper, we assess if conflict prediction is feasible. Method. We design a\nclassifier for predicting merge conflicts, based on 9 light-weight Git feature\nsets. To evaluate our predictor, we perform a large-scale study on 267, 657\nmerge scenarios from 744 GitHub repositories in seven programming languages.\nResults. Our results show that we achieve high f1-scores, varying from 0.95 to\n0.97 for different programming languages, when predicting safe merge scenarios.\nThe f1-score is between 0.57 and 0.68 for the conflicting merge scenarios.\nConclusions. Predicting merge conflicts is feasible in practice, especially in\nthe context of predicting safe merge scenarios as a pre-filtering step for\nspeculative merging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 20:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

We\nintroduce a refinement of Malle's conjecture, if $G$ is a group with a\nnontrivial Galois action then we consider the set of crossed homomorphisms in\n$Z^1(K,G)$ (or equivalently $1$-coclasses in $H^1(K,G)$) with bounded\ndiscriminant.

The key constituents of the channel\nresource theory are quantum channel boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum\nchannels, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum\nsuperchannel (the most general physical transformation of a quantum channel).\nOne main question of the resource theory is the approximate channel box\ntransformation problem, in which the goal is to transform an initial channel\nbox (or boxes) to a final channel box (or boxes), while allowing for an\nasymmetric error in the transformation. The channel resource theory is richer\nthan its counterpart for states because there is a wider variety of ways in\nwhich this question can be framed, either in the one-shot or $n$-shot regimes,\nwith the latter having parallel and sequential variants. As in our prior work\n[arXiv:1905.11629], we consider two special cases of the general channel box\ntransformation problem, known as distinguishability distillation and dilution.\nFor the one-shot case, we find that the optimal values of the various tasks are\nequal to the non-smooth or smooth channel min- or max-relative entropies, thus\nendowing all of these quantities with operational interpretations. In the\nasymptotic sequential setting, we prove that the exact distinguishability cost\nis equal to the channel max-relative entropy and the distillable\ndistinguishability is equal to the amortized channel relative entropy of\n[arXiv:1808.01498].

Our first result is that\ninserting keys into an empty binary search tree via splaying in the order of\neither $T$'s preorder or $T$'s postorder takes linear time. Our proof uses the\nfact that preorders and postorders are pattern-avoiding: i.e. they contain no\nsubsequences that are order-isomorphic to $(2,3,1)$ and $(3,1,2)$,\nrespectively. Pattern-avoidance implies certain constraints on the manner in\nwhich items are inserted. We exploit this structure with a simple potential\nfunction that counts inserted nodes lying on access paths to uninserted nodes.\nOur methods can likely be extended to permutations that avoid more general\npatterns. Second, if $T'$ is any other binary search tree with the same keys as\n$T$ and $T$ is weight-balanced (Nievergelt and Reingold 1973), then splaying\n$T$'s preorder sequence or $T$'s postorder sequence starting from $T'$ takes\nlinear time.

The cost of executing the task is the sum of the time spent searching and\nthe time spent optimizing the searches with restructuring operations. Sleator\nand Tarjan introduced this notion in 1985, along with an algorithm and a\nconjecture. The algorithm, Splay, is an elegant procedure for performing\nadjustments that move searched items to the top of the tree. The conjecture,\ncalled dynamic optimality, is that the cost of splaying is always within a\nconstant factor of the optimal algorithm for performing searches. We lay a\nfoundation for proving the dynamic optimality conjecture. Central to our method\nis approximate monotonicity. Approximately monotone algorithms are those whose\ncost does not increase by more than a fixed multiple after removing searches\nfrom the sequence. As we shall see, Splay is dynamically optimal if and only if\nit is approximately monotone. This result extends to a weaker form of\napproximate monotonicity as well as insertion, deletion, and related\nalgorithms.

The\nmorphology of the cytoskeletal network, along which active, motor-driven\nintracellular transport takes place, plays a critical role in regulating such\ntransport phases. Here, we use a computational model to address the existence\nand sensitivity of dynamic sequestering and how it depends on the parameters\ngoverning the cytoskeletal network geometry, with a focus on filament lengths\nand polarization away or toward the periphery. Our model of intracellular\ntransport solves for the time evolution of a probability distribution of cargo\nthat is transported by passive diffusion in the bulk cytoplasm and driven by\nmotors on explicitly rendered, polar cytoskeletal filaments with random\norientations. We show that depending on the lengths and polarizations of\nfilaments in the network, dynamic sequestering regions can form in different\nregions of the cell. Furthermore, we find that, for certain parameters, the\nresidence time of cargo is non-monotonic with increasing filament length,\nindicating an optimal regime for dynamic sequestration that is potentially\ntunable via filament length.

The quantum states of individual photons can be\nmanipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental\nstaple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century.

There are\ntwo primary approaches to energy efficient navigation: Offline approaches rely\non a previously built energy map as input to a path planner. Obtaining energy\nmaps for large environments is challenging. Alternatively, the robot can\nnavigate in an online fashion and build the map as it navigates. Online\nnavigation in unknown environments with only local information is still a\nchallenging research problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach which\naddresses both of these challenges. Our approach starts with a segmented aerial\nimage of the environment. We show that a coarse energy map can be built from\nthe segmentation. However, the absolute energy value for a specific terrain\ntype (e.g. grass) can vary across environments. Therefore, rather than using\nthis energy map directly, we use it to build the covariance function for a\nGaussian Process (GP) based representation of the environment. In the online\nphase, energy measurements collected during navigation are used for estimating\nenergy profiles across the environment using GP regression. Coupled with an\nA*-like navigation algorithm, we show in simulations that our approach\noutperforms representative baseline approaches.

Although game theory is normally\nused to model interactions individually, larger spaces of games can be helpful\nfor modeling how interactions change. We introduce a framework for modeling\n\"institutional evolution,\" how individuals change the games they are placed in.\nWe contrast this with the more familiar within-game \"behavioral evolution\".\nStarting from an initial game, agents trace trajectories through game space by\nrepeatedly navigating to more preferable games until they converge on attractor\ngames that are preferred to all others. Agents choose between games on the\nbasis of their \"institutional preferences,\" which define between-game\ncomparisons in terms of game-level features such as stability, fairness, and\nefficiency. Computing institutional change trajectories over the two-player\nspace, we find that the attractors of self-interested economic agents\nover-represent fairness by 100% relative to baseline, even though those agents\nare indifferent to fairness. This seems to occur because fairness, as a game\nfeature, co-occurs with the self-serving features these agents do prefer. We\nthus present institutional evolution as a mechanism for encouraging the\nspontaneous emergence of cooperation among inherently selfish agents. We then\nextend these findings beyond two players, and to two other types of\nevolutionary agent: the relative fitness maximizing agent of evolutionary game\ntheory (who maximizes inequality), and the relative group fitness maximizing\nagent of multi-level/group selection theory (who minimizes inequality).

We find that gas flows rapidly\nthrough the outer part of the envelope, but this flow does not drive accretion.\nInstead, gas accretion is the result of quasi-static contraction of the inner\nenvelope, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the mass flow through\nthe outer atmosphere. For planets smaller than Saturn, we measure moderate gas\naccretion rates that are below 1 Jupiter mass per Myr. Higher mass planets,\nhowever, accrete up to 10 times faster and do not reveal a self-driven\nmechanism that can halt gas accretion. Therefore, the reason for the final\nmasses of Saturn and Jupiter remains difficult to understand, unless their\ncompletion coincided with the dissipation of the Solar Nebula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 08:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Applying ZSL to 3D point cloud objects is an\nemerging topic in the area of 3D vision, however, a significant problem that\nZSL often suffers from is the so-called hubness problem, which is when a model\nis biased to predict only a few particular labels for most of the test\ninstances. We observe that this hubness problem is even more severe for 3D\nrecognition than for 2D recognition. One reason for this is that in 2D one can\nuse pre-trained networks trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which\nproduces high-quality features. However, in the 3D case there are no such\nlarge-scale, labelled datasets available for pre-training which means that the\nextracted 3D features are of poorer quality which, in turn, exacerbates the\nhubness problem.

One of the main topics of\ninterest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy\nmechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a\ncryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into\nthe ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this\nwork we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs\n(ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed\nin 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare\nthese strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most\nefficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms\nand optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous\nschemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not\ndesirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain.\nIn case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be\npossible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can\nalso be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense\nthat it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only\nrestricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge\n(PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for\nDLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs\nprotocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

A central issue of VID is the appearance degradation of video\nframes caused by fast motion. This problem is essentially ill-posed for a\nsingle frame.

Indeed, the\nenergy cost quantifies how much effort is required to drive the system from one\nstate to another when it is fully controllable. A fully controllable system\nmeans that the system can be driven by external inputs from any initial state\nto any final state in finite time. However, it is prohibitively expensive and\nunnecessary to confine that the system is fully controllable when we merely\nneed to accomplish the so-called target control---controlling a subnet of nodes\nchosen from the entire network. Yet, when the system is partially controllable,\nthe associated energy cost remains elusive. Here we present the minimum energy\ncost for controlling an arbitrary subset of nodes of a network. Moreover, we\nsystematically show the scaling behavior of the precise upper and lower bounds\nof the minimum energy in term of the time given to accomplish control. For\ncontrolling a given number of target nodes, we further demonstrate that the\nassociated energy over different configurations can differ by several orders of\nmagnitude. When the adjacency matrix of the network is nonsingular, we can\nsimplify the framework by just considering the induced subgraph spanned by\ntarget nodes instead of the entire network. Importantly, we find that, energy\ncost could be saved by orders of magnitude as we only need the partial\ncontrollability of the entire network. Our theoretical results are all\ncorroborated by numerical calculations, and pave the way for estimating the\nenergy cost to implement realistic target control in various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

We use the\nstandard assumption that the source of continuum radiation is located near\ncentral plane of the accretion disc, where the temperature is the highest. This\ncorresponds to the Milne problem consideration for continuum. We shortly\ndiscuss the impossibility of the Milne problem for the resonance radiation. We\nassume that the resonant atoms are located in a thin layer of an accretion disc\nnear the surface. In this case the resonance line emission arises due to\nscattering of a continuum on the resonant atoms. In thin layer we can neglect\nthe multiple scattering of the resonance radiation on the resonant atoms. We\nconsider the axially symmetric problems, where the Stokes parameter U =0. We\ntake into account the Doppler effect for the frequencies of the resonance line.\nThe three types of the resonant atom sources are considered (see Figs.1-3). The\nfirst source is the axially symmetric continuous distribution of the resonant\natoms along the circular orbit. The second spot-like source rotates in the\norbit. The third type presents two spot-like sources located in the orbit\ncontrary one to another. In the first and third cases the shape of the emitting\nresonance line is symmetric, i.e. the right and left wings have the similar\nshapes. In the second case the resonance line has asymmetric shape. The shape\nof the emerging line depends significantly on the ratio of the rotation\nvelocity value to the velocity, characterizing the Doppler width.

Online\nphysical reasoning is therefore a fundamental requirement for robust autonomous\nagents. When the dynamics involves multiple modes (due to contacts or\ninteractions between objects) and sensing must proceed directly from a rich\nsensory stream such as video, then traditional methods for system\nidentification may not be well suited. We propose an approach wherein fast\nparameter estimation can be achieved directly from video.

However, learning the graph structure is often complex,\nparticularly when the graph is cyclic, and the transitions from one node to\nanother are conditioned such as graphs used to represent a finite state\nmachine. To solve this problem, we propose to extend the memory based Neural\nTuring Machine (NTM) with two novel additions.

In this work,\nwe investigated whether it is possible to detect and spatially resolve the\nX-ray emission from these systems using archival Chandra observations of the\nULX Holmberg IX X-1. This source is an ideal target to study for two reasons:\nit is surrounded by an optical bubble nebula with a large spatial extent\n($\\sim$ 400 pc) that can easily be resolved with Chandra. Further, it has a\nhard X-ray continuum that is easily distinguishable from the expected soft\nthermal emission from the nebula.

We investigate the impact of\neccentricity tides on the rotation of rocky planets hosting a thin uniform\nocean and orbiting cool dwarf stars such as TRAPPIST-1, with orbital periods\n~1-10 days. Combining the linear theory of oceanic tides in the shallow water\napproximation with the Andrade model for the solid part of the planet, we\ndevelop a global model including the coupling effects of ocean loading,\nself-attraction, and deformation of the solid regions. We derive from this\nmodel analytic solutions for the tidal Love numbers and torque exerted on the\nplanet. These solutions are used with realistic values of parameters provided\nby advanced models of the internal structure and tidal oscillations of solid\nbodies to explore the parameter space both analytically and numerically. Our\nmodel allows us to fully characterise the frequency-resonant tidal response of\nthe planet, and particularly the features of resonances associated with the\noceanic tidal modes (eigenfrequencies, resulting maxima of the tidal torque and\nLove numbers) as functions of the planet parameters (mass, radius, Andrade\nparameters, ocean depth and Rayleigh drag frequency). Resonances associated\nwith the oceanic tide decrease the critical eccentricity beyond which\nasynchronous rotation states distinct from the usual spin-orbit resonances can\nexist. We provide an estimation and scaling laws for this critical\neccentricity, which is found to be lowered by roughly one order of magnitude,\nswitching from ~0.3 to ~0.06 in typical cases and to ~0.01 in extremal ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 11:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

We introduce A-SKY, a cryptographic\naccess control extension capable of providing confidentiality and anonymity\nguarantees, all while efficiently scaling to large organizations. A-SKY\nleverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) to address the impracticality\nof anonymous broadcast encryption (ANOBE) schemes, achieving faster execution\ntimes and shorter ciphertexts. The innovative design of A-SKY limits the usage\nof the TEE to the narrow set of data producing operations, and thus optimizes\nthe dominant data consumption actions by not requiring a TEE. Furthermore, we\npropose a scalable implementation for A-SKY leveraging micro-services that\npreserves strong security guarantees while being able to efficiently manage\nrealistic large user bases. Results highlight that the A-SKY cryptographic\nscheme is 3 orders of magnitude better than state of the art ANOBE, and an\nend-to-end system encapsulating A-SKY can elastically scale to support groups\nof 10 000 users while maintaining processing costs below 1 second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 12:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 12:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 15:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

In optomechanical cavities, phonon and photon lasing is\nfacilitated by the ability of photons and phonons to interact intensively and\nexcite one another coherently. The lasing linewidths of both phonons and\nphotons are critical for practical application. However, thus far, these\nlinewidths have not been explored in detail in cavity optomechanical systems.\nThis study investigates the underlying dynamics of lasing in optomechanical\ncavities and experimentally demonstrates simultaneous photon and phonon lasing\nwith narrow linewidths in a silicon optomechanical crystal cavity. We find that\nthe linewidths can be accounted for by two distinct physical mechanisms in two\nregimes, namely the normal regime and the reversed regime, where the intrinsic\noptical decay rate is either larger or smaller than the intrinsic mechanical\ndecay rate. In the normal regime, an ultra-narrow spectral linewidth of 5.4 kHz\nfor phonon lasing at 6.22 GHz can be achieved regardless of the linewidth of\nthe pump light, while these results are counterintuitively unattainable for\nphoton lasing in the reversed regime. These results pave the way towards\nharnessing the coherence of both photons and phonons in silicon photonic\ndevices and reshaping their spectra, potentially opening up new technologies in\nsensing, metrology, spectroscopy, and signal processing, as well as in\napplications requiring sources that offer an ultra-high degree of coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 12:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

This represents\nan inexplicable discrepancy with respect to the divB=0 law. The objective of\nthis paper is to explain these observations through the law B=\\mu_0(H+M) in\nmagnetized media. Magnetization is due to plasma diamagnetism, which results\nfrom the spiral motion of free electrons or charges about the magnetic field.\nTheir usual photospheric densities lead to very weak magnetization M, four\norders of magnitude lower than H. It is then assumed that electrons escape from\nthe solar interior, where their thermal velocity is much higher than the escape\nvelocity, in spite of the effect of protons. They escape from lower layers in a\nquasi-static spreading, and accumulate in the photosphere. By evaluating the\nmagnetic energy of an elementary atom embedded in the magnetized medium obeying\nthe macroscopic law B=\\mu_0(H+M), it is shown that the Zeeman Hamiltonian is\ndue to the effect of H. Thus, what is measured is H. The decrease in density\nwith height is responsible for non-zero divergence of M, which is compensated\nfor by the divergence of H, in order to ensure divB=0. The behavior of the\nobserved quantities is recovered. The problem of the divergence of the observed\nmagnetic field in solar active regions finally reveals evidence of electron\naccumulation in the solar photosphere. This is not the case of the heavier\nprotons, which remain in lower layers. An electric field would thus be present\nin the solar interior, but as the total charge remains negligible, no electric\nfield or effect would result outside the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 12:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 14:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 15:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 09:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 13:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 14:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

In despite of intensive efforts, experimental evidence of\nthe topological surface states (SSs) remains elusive. Here, by combining\nfirst-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) experiments, we have revealed that EuSn2As2 is an antiferromagnetic TI\nwith observation of Dirac SSs consistent with our prediction. We also observe\nnearly gapless Dirac SSs in antiferromagnetic TIs MnBi2nTe3n+1 (n = 1 and 2),\nwhich were absent in previous ARPES results. These results provide clear\nevidence for nontrivial topology of these intrinsic magnetic TIs. Furthermore,\nwe find that the topological SSs show no observable changes across the magnetic\ntransition within the experimental resolution, indicating that the magnetic\norder has quite small effect on the topological SSs, which can be attributed to\nweak hybridization between the localized magnetic moments, from either 4f or 3d\norbitals, and the topological electronic states. This provides insights for\nfurther research that the correlations between magnetism and topological states\nneed to be strengthened to induce larger gaps in the topological SSs, which\nwill facilitate the realization of topological quantum phenomena at higher\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 13:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 07:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Using an effective Hamiltonian, based on constituent quarks and\ndiquarks, we calculate the pentaquark mass spectrum for the complete $SU (3)_F$\nlowest $S$- and $P$-wave multiplets, taking into account dominant spin-spin,\nspin-orbit, orbital and tensor interactions. The resulting spectrum is very\nrich and we work out the quark flavor compositions, masses, and $J^P$ quantum\nnumbers of the pentaquarks.

The variance of the\ncolored Gaussian noise is used as a whitening filter on the data before\ncomputation of the likelihood function. In practice the noise variance is not\nknown and it evolves over timescales of dozens of seconds to minutes.

The\nfirst method uses large amounts of data separated from the specific segment we\nwish to analyze and computes the power spectral density of the noise through\nthe mean-median Welch method. The second method uses the same data segment as\nthe parameter estimation analysis, which potentially includes a gravitational\nwave signal, and obtains the whitening filter through a fit of the power\nspectrum of the data in terms of a sum of splines and Lorentzians.

Robust MPC (RMPC)\naddresses this limitation by optimizing over feedback policies but at the\nexpense of increased computational complexity. Tube MPC is an approximate\nsolution strategy in which a robust controller, designed offline, keeps the\nsystem in an invariant tube around a desired nominal trajectory, generated\nonline. Naturally, this decomposition is suboptimal, especially for systems\nwith changing objectives or operating conditions. In addition, many tube MPC\napproaches are unable to capture state-dependent uncertainty due to the\ncomplexity of calculating invariant tubes, resulting in overly-conservative\napproximations. This work presents the Dynamic Tube MPC (DTMPC) framework for\nnonlinear systems where both the tube geometry and open-loop trajectory are\noptimized simultaneously. By using boundary layer sliding control, the tube\ngeometry can be expressed as a simple relation between control parameters and\nuncertainty bound; enabling the tube geometry dynamics to be added to the\nnominal MPC optimization with minimal increase in computational complexity. In\naddition, DTMPC is able to leverage state-dependent uncertainty to reduce\nconservativeness and improve optimization feasibility. DTMPC is demonstrated to\nrobustly perform obstacle avoidance and modify the tube geometry in response to\nobstacle proximity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

The predominant\nstrategy to keep up with these shifts is to train predictive models\ncontinuously, on fresh data, in order to prevent them from becoming stale.\nHowever, in many ad systems positive labels are only observed after a possibly\nlong and random delay.

However, performance and parameterization are compromised\nby net heat transfer between caloric working bodies and heat transfer fluids.\nHere we show that this net transfer can be avoided-resulting in true, balanced\nregeneration-if one varies the applied electric field while an electrocaloric\n(EC) working body dumps heat on traversing a passive fluid regenerator. Our EC\nworking body is represented by bulk PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 (PST) near its first-order\nferroelectric phase transition, where we record directly measured adiabatic\ntemperature changes of up to 2.2 K. Indirectly measured adiabatic temperature\nchanges of similar magnitude were identified, unlike normal, from adiabatic\nmeasurements of polarization, at nearby starting temperatures, without assuming\na constant heat capacity.

This will cause unnecessary error around the\ndiscontinuity and serious overshooting. In arXiv:1807.01524 [math.NA], we\nreformulate the equation by introducing a new flux variable to separate the\ncontinuity requirements of the flux and the solution. Realizing that the\nRaviart-Thomas mixed element space has enough degrees of freedom to approximate\nboth the flux and its divergence, we eliminate the solution from the system and\nget two flux-only formulations, and develop corresponding LSFEMs. The solution\nthen is recovered by simple post-processing methods using its relation with the\nflux.

The portfolio\noptimization problem is naturally modeled as a mean-risk bi-criteria\noptimization problem where the mean rate of return of the portfolio must be\nmaximized whereas a given risk measure must be minimized. Several mathematical\nprogramming models and techniques have been presented in the literature in\norder to efficiently solve the portfolio problem. A relatively recent promising\nline of research is to exploit clustering information of an assets network in\norder to develop new portfolio optimization paradigms. In this paper we endow\nthe assets network with a metric based on correlation coefficients between\nassets' returns, and show how classical location problems on networks can be\nused for clustering assets.

These programs have their own type of bugs known as concurrency\nbugs and among them, data race bugs have been mostly in the focus of\nresearchers over the past decades. In fact, detecting data races is a very\nchallenging and important task. There have been several research paths in this\narea with many sophisticated tools designed and utilized that focus on\ndetecting data race at the file level. In this paper, we propose DeepRace, a\nnovel approach toward detecting data races in the source code. We build a deep\nneural network model to find data races instead of creating a data race\ndetector manually. Our model uses a one-layer convolutional neural network\n(CNN) with different window size to find data races method. Then we adopt the\nclass activation map function with global average pooling to extract the\nweights of the last convolutional layer and backpropagate it with the input\nsource code to extract the line of codes with a data race. Thus, the DeepRace\nmodel can detect the data race bugs on a file and line of code level. In\naddition, we noticed that DeepRace successfully detects several buggy lines of\ncode at different locations of the file. We tested the model with OpenMP and\nPOSIX source code datasets which consist of more than 5000 and 8000 source code\nfiles respectively. We were able to successfully classify buggy source code\nfiles and achieve accuracies ranging from 81% and 86%. We also measured the\nperformance of detecting and visualizing the data race at the line of code\nlevels and our model achieved promising results. We only had a small number of\nfalse positives and false, ranging from 1 to 10. Furthermore, we used the\nintersection of union to measure the accuracy of the buggy lines of code, our\nmodel achieved promising results of 66 percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

However, scaling up the\nnumber of qubits will bring the circuit out of this regime and invalidates\ncurrent theories.

The scalar field is\nassumed to be conformally coupled to the outside matter. The induced scalar\ncharge is determined and the required conditions to have regular field are\nobtained. The results are compared with the case of a black hole. Conditions to\nhave regular non-trivial scalar field out of the black hole horizon are\ninvestigated.

I find that the flux density of the resulting emission (i) has\na dominant value and is linearly polarized within a sharply delineated\nradiation beam whose orientation and polar width are determined by the range of\nvalues of the linear speeds of the rotating source distribution, and (ii)\ndecays with the distance $d$ from the source as $d^{-\\alpha}$ in which the\nvalue of $\\alpha$ lies between $1$ and $2$ (instead of being equal to $2$ as in\na conventional radiation) across the beam. In that the rate at which boundaries\nof the retarded distribution of such a source change with time depends on its\nduration monotonically, this is an intrinsically transient emission process:\ntemporal rate of change of the energy density of the radiation generated by it\nhas a time-averaged value that is negative (instead of being zero as in a\nconventional radiation) at points where the envelopes of the wave fronts\nemanating from the constituent volume elements of the source distribution are\ncusped. The difference in the fluxes of power across any two spheres centred on\nthe source is in this case balanced by the change with time of the energy\ncontained inside the shell bounded by those spheres. These results are relevant\nnot only to long-range transmitters in communications technology but also to\nastrophysical objects containing rapidly rotating neutron stars (such as\npulsars) and to the interpretation of the energetics of the multi-wavelength\nemissions from sources that lie at cosmological distances (such as radio and\ngamma-ray bursts). The analysis presented in this paper is self-contained and\nsupersedes my earlier works on this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 10:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

Even if the\ntechnology itself is quite mature and specified, the currently deployed\nwireless resource allocation strategies are still coarse and based on rough\nheuristics. This paper proposes an innovative \"sequential waterfilling\"\nstrategy for assigning Spreading Factors (SF) to End-Devices (ED). Our design\nrelies on three complementary approaches: i) equalize the Time-on-Air of the\npackets transmitted by the system's EDs in each spreading factor's group; ii)\nbalance the spreading factors across multiple access gateways, and iii) keep\ninto account the channel capture, which our experimental results show to be\nvery substantial in LoRa. While retaining an extremely simple and scalable\nimplementation, this strategy yields a significant improvement (up to 38%) in\nthe network capacity over the legacy Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), and appears to\nbe extremely robust to different operating/load conditions and network topology\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 13:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 11:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}
