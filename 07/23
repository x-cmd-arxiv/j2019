Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$, for\nexample, displays complex magnetism and ultra-high coercive fields - up to an\nincredible 55~T. Here, we combine infrared and optical spectroscopies with\nhigh-field magnetization and first principles calculations to explore the\nfundamental excitations of the lattice and related coupling processes including\nspin-lattice and electron-phonon mechanisms. Magneto-infrared spectroscopy\nreveals spin-lattice coupling of three phonons that modulate the Ir environment\nto reduce the energy required to modify the spin arrangement. While these modes\nprimarily affect exchange within the chains, analysis also uncovers important\ninter-chain motion. This provides a mechanism by which inter-chain interactions\ncan occur in the developing model for ultra-high coercivity. At the same time,\nanalysis of the on-site Ir$^{4+}$ excitations reveals vibronic coupling and\nextremely large crystal field parameters that lead to a t$_{2g}$-derived\nlow-spin state for Ir. These findings highlight the spin-charge-lattice\nentanglement in Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$ and suggest that similar interactions may take\nplace in other 3$d$/5$d$ hybrids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 16:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Applying our methods to the one-dimensional parking problem in\n$\\mathbb{Z}$, we improve on previous work, showing that for $p<1/2$ the\nexpected journey length of a car is finite, and for $p=1/2$ the expected\njourney length by time $t$ grows like $t^{3/4}$ up to a polylogarithmic factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 17:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

The plasma flow is produced by the JxB\nacceleration of the ablated wire material, and a magnetic field of several\nTesla is embedded at source by the driving current. This setup has been used\nfor a variety of experiments investigating the interactions of magnetized\nplasma flows. In experiments designed to investigate magnetic reconnection, the\ncollision of counter-streaming flows, carrying oppositely directed magnetic\nfields, leads to the formation of a reconnection layer in which we observe ions\nreaching temperatures much greater than predicted by classical heating\nmechanisms. The breakup of this layer under the plasmoid instability is\ndependent on the properties of the inflowing plasma, which can be controlled by\nthe choice of the wire array material. In other experiments, magnetized shocks\nwere formed by placing obstacles in the path of the magnetized plasma flow. The\npile-up of magnetic flux in front of a conducting obstacle produces a magnetic\nprecursor acting on upstream electrons at the distance of the ion inertial\nlength. This precursor subsequently develops into a steep density transition\nvia ion-electron fluid decoupling. Obstacles which possess a strong private\nmagnetic field affect the upstream flow over a much greater distance, providing\nan extended bow shock structure. In the region surrounding the obstacle the\nmagnetic pressure holds off the flow, forming a void of plasma material,\nanalogous to the magnetopause around planetary bodies with self-generated\nmagnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 17:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Specifically, we study random-access codes, previously\nintroduced for the AWGN multiple-access channel (MAC) by Polyanskiy'2017, in\nthe practically more relevant case of users subject to Rayleigh fading, when\nchannel gains are unknown to the decoder. We propose a random coding\nachievability bound, which we analyze both non-asymptotically (at finite\nblocklength) and asymptotically. As a candidate practical solution, we propose\nan explicit sparse-graph based coding scheme together with an alternating\nbelief-propagation decoder. The latter's performance is found to be\nsurprisingly close to the finite-blocklength bounds. Our main findings are\ntwofold. First, just like in the AWGN MAC we see that jointly decoding large\nnumber of users leads to a surprising phase transition effect, where at\nspectral efficiencies below a critical threshold (5-15 bps/Hz depending on\nreliability) a perfect multi-user interference cancellation is possible.\nSecond, while the presence of Rayleigh fading significantly increases the\nminimal required energy-per-bit $E_b/N_0$ (from about 0-2 dB to about 8-11 dB),\nthe inherent randomization introduced by the channel makes it much easier to\nattain the optimal performance via iterative schemes.\n  In all, it is hoped that a principled definition of the random-access model\ntogether with our information-theoretic analysis will open the road towards\nunified benchmarking and comparison performance of various random-access\nsolutions, such as the currently discussed candidates (MUSA, SCMA, RSMA) for\nthe 5G/6G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 17:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Through deep learning, these\ndatasets were used to train automatic detectors for DR and a few other frequent\npathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits the\nadoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions\nthat ophthalmologists currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior\nischemic optic neuropathy. The reason is that standard deep learning requires\ntoo many examples of these conditions. However, this limitation can be\naddressed with few-shot learning, a machine learning paradigm where a\nclassifier has to generalize to a new category not seen in training, given only\na few examples of this category. This paper presents a new few-shot learning\nframework that extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for\nfrequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare\ncondition detection. It is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive\nphotographs containing the same anomalies as similar, even though these CNNs\nwere trained to detect unrelated conditions. This observation was based on the\nt-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our probabilistic\nmodel. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 screening examinations from the\nOPHDIAT screening network show that 37 conditions, out of 41, can be detected\nwith an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938).\nIn particular, this framework significantly outperforms other frameworks for\ndetecting rare conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and\nSiamese networks, another few-shot learning solution.

Since the quantity and quality of lensing data is constantly\nimproving, it makes sense to ask if the estimated uncertainties are robust\nagainst changes in the data. We address this question using free-form Grale,\nwhich takes only image information as input, and nothing pertaining to cluster\ngalaxies.

Normally, adjacency matrices will cast an\nartificial and random node-order on the graphs, which renders the performance\nof deep models on graph classification tasks extremely erratic, and the\nrepresentations learned by such models lack clear interpretability. To\neliminate the unnecessary node-order constraint, we propose a novel model named\nIsomorphic Neural Network (IsoNN), which learns the graph representation by\nextracting its isomorphic features via the graph matching between input graph\nand templates. IsoNN has two main components: graph isomorphic feature\nextraction component and classification component. The graph isomorphic feature\nextraction component utilizes a set of subgraph templates as the kernel\nvariables to learn the possible subgraph patterns existing in the input graph\nand then computes the isomorphic features. A set of permutation matrices is\nused in the component to break the node-order brought by the matrix\nrepresentation. Three fully-connected layers are used as the classification\ncomponent in IsoNN.

We use an extension to\nthe BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to explore the\neffects that a running scalar spectral index has on large-scale structure\n(LSS), using Planck CMB constraints to initialize the simulations.

In terms of\nthe matter power spectrum, we find that a running scalar spectral index affects\nall k-scales examined in this study, with a negative (positive) running leading\nto an amplification (suppression) of power. These effects should be easily\ndetectable with upcoming surveys such as LSST and Euclid. In the mass range\nsampled, a positive running leads to an increase in the mass of galaxy groups\nand clusters, with the favoured negative running leading to a decrease in mass\nof lower-mass (M <~ 10^13 M_solar) halos, but an increase for the most massive\n(M >~ 10^13 M_solar) halos. Changes in the mass are generally confined to 5-10%\nwhich, while not insignificant, cannot by itself reconcile the claimed tension\nbetween the primary CMB and cluster number counts.

The method of segmentation is used to analyze anal to miscall structures\nin medical imaging. Objective: This study describes a new method for brain\nMagnetic Resonance Image (MRI) segmentation via a novel algorithm based on\ngenetic and regional growth. Methods: Among medical imaging methods, brains MRI\nsegmentation is important due to the high contrast of non-intrusive soft tissue\nand high spatial resolution. Size variations of brain tissues are often\naccompanied by various diseases such as Alzheimers disease. As our knowledge\nabout the relationship between various brain diseases and deviation of brain\nanatomy increases, MRI segmentation is exploited as the first step in early\ndiagnosis. In this paper, the regional growth method and auto-mate selection of\ninitial points by genetic algorithm are used to introduce a new method for MRI\nsegmentation. Primary pixels and similarity criterion are automatically by\ngenetic algorithms to maximize the accuracy and validity in image segmentation.\nResults: By using genetic algorithms and defining the fixed function of image\nsegmentation, the initial points for the algorithm were found. The proposed\nalgorithms are applied to the images and results are manually selected by\nregional growth in which the initial points were compared. The results showed\nthat the proposed algorithm could reduce segmentation error effectively.\nConclusion: The study concluded that the proposed algorithm could reduce\nsegmentation error effectively and help us to diagnose brain diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 18:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Using\nthem, various topological applications on symplectic fillings are obtained,\nincluding the uniqueness of diffeomorphism types of fillings for many contact\nmanifolds.

To solve this limitation, there are a\nnumber of recent unsupervised domain adaptation and unsupervised learning\nmethods that leverage unlabelled target domain training data.

The Optical Wireless\n(OW) physical layer has been researched extensively, however less work was\ndevoted to multiple access and how the OW front end is connected to the\nnetwork. In this paper, an OWC system which employs a wavelength division\nmultiple access (WDMA) scheme is studied, for the purpose of supporting\nmultiple users. In addition, a cloud/fog architecture is proposed for the first\ntime for OWC to provide processing capabilities. The cloud/fog-integrated\narchitecture uses visible indoor light to create high data rate connections\nwith potential mobile nodes. These optical wireless nodes are further clustered\nand used as fog mini servers to provide processing services through the optical\nwireless channel for other users. Additional fog processing units are located\nin the room, the building, the campus and at the metro level. Further\nprocessing capabilities are provided by remote cloud sites. A mixed-integer\nlinear programming (MILP) model was developed and utilised to optimise resource\nallocation in the indoor OWC system. A second MILP model was developed to\noptimise the placement of processing tasks in the different fog and cloud nodes\navailable. The optimisation of tasks placement in the cloud-/fog-integrated\narchitecture was analysed using the MILP models. Multiple scenarios were\nconsidered where the mobile node locations were varied in the room and the\namount of processing and data rate requested by each optical wireless node is\nvaried. The results help identify the optimum colour and access point to use\nfor communication for a given mobile node location and OWC system\nconfiguration, the optimum location to place processing and the impact of the\nnetwork architecture.

However, the existence of globular clusters with similar metal content\nand absolute age but different horizontal branch morphologies, suggests the\npresence of another parameter affecting the star distribution along the branch.\nTo investigate the variation of the horizontal branch morphology in Galactic\nglobular clusters, we define a new photometric horizontal branch morphology\nindex, overcoming some of the limitations and degeneracies affecting similar\nindices available in the literature. We took advantage of a sample of 64\nGalactic globular clusters, with both space-based imaging data and homogeneous\nground-based photometric catalogues in five different bands ($U$,$B$,$V$, $R$,\n$I$). The new index, $\\tau_{HB}$, is defined as the ratio between the areas\nsubtended by the cumulative number distribution in magnitude ($I$) and in\ncolour ($V-I$) of all stars along the horizontal branch. This new index shows a\nlinear trend over the entire range in metallicity (-2.35 $\\leq$ [Fe/H] $\\leq$\n-0.12) covered by our Galactic globular cluster sample. We found a linear\nrelation between $\\tau_{HB}$ and absolute cluster ages.

Moreover, we identified a subsample of eight\nclusters that are peculiar according to their $\\tau_{HB}$ values. These\nclusters have bluer horizontal branch morphology when compared to typical ones\nof similar metallicity.

The\nplateau phase characterized by volume-law operator entanglement corresponds to\nthe barrier in operator entanglement.

The rational\nCFTs have the shortest plateau phase, followed by the slowest decay phase; the\nholographic CFTs mark the opposite end, i.e. having the longest plateau phase\nfollowed by a discontinuous drop; and the random unitary circuit shows the\nintermediate behavior.

Self-ensembling is a simple approach\nused in SSL to encourage consensus among ensemble predictions of unknown\nlabels, improving generalization of the model by making it more insensitive to\nthe latent space.

This method\nis stable and accurate for both large and small optical depths and radiation\npressures. The radiation stress-energy tensor is evolved in flux-conservative\nform, and closed with a swarm of samples that each transport a multigroup\nrepresentation of the invariant specific intensity along a null geodesic. In\neach zone, the enclosed samples are used to efficiently construct a Delaunay\ntriangulation of the unit sphere in the comoving frame, which in turn is used\nto calculate the Eddington tensor, average source terms, and adaptively refine\nthe sample swarm. Radiation four-fources are evaluated in the moment sector in\na semi-implicit fashion. The radiative transfer equation is solved in invariant\nform deterministically for each sample. Since each sample carries a discrete\nrepresentation of the full spectrum, the cost of evaluating the transport\noperator is independent of the number of frequency groups, representing a\nsignificant reduction of algorithmic complexity for transport in frequency\ndependent problems. The major approximation we make in this work is performing\nscattering in an angle-averaged way, with Compton scattering further\napproximated by the Kompaneets equation.

This mode coupling is coalescence of two modes with\nnearly equal phase velocities: inertial wave (IW) having positive energy and a\nstreaming dust wave (SDW) having negative energy as measured in the frame of\ngas environment being at rest in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. SDW is a\ntrivial mode produced by the bulk streaming of dust, which transports\nperturbations of dust density. In this way, settling combined with radial drift\nof the dust makes possible coupling of SDW with IW and the onset of the\ninstability. In accordance with the concept of the mode coupling, RDI growth\nrate is proportional to the square root of the coupling term of the dispersion\nequation, which itself is proportional to mass fraction of dust, $f\\ll 1$. This\nclarifies why RDI growth rate $\\propto f^{1/2}$. When SDW has positive energy,\nits resonance with IW provides an avoided crossing instead of the mode\ncoupling. In the high wavenumber limit RDI with unbounded growth rate $\\propto\nf^{1/3}$ is explained by the triple mode coupling, which is coupling of SDW\nwith two IW. It coexists with a new quasi-resonant instability accompanied by\nbonding of two oppositely propagating low-frequency IW. The mode coupling does\nnot exist for dust streaming only radially in a disc. In this case RDI is\nprovided by the obscured mechanism associated with the inertia of solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 23:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Methods: In this paper\nparametric, non-parametric and robust reference intervals with Tukey and block\nelimination are calculated from a dataset of over 32,000 serum immunoglobulin A\n(IgA) measurements. Results: The outlier elimination method was significantly\nmore determinative of the reference intervals than the calculation method. The\nTukey elimination procedure consistently eliminated significantly more values\nthan the block method of Dixon and Reed across all age ranges. If Tukey\nelimination was applied, variation between reference intervals produced by the\ndifferent calculation methods was minimal. Block elimination rarely eliminated\nvalues. The non-parametric reference intervals were more sensitive to outliers,\nwhich in the IgA context, led to higher and wider reference intervals for the\nolder age groups. There were only minimal differences between robust and\nparametric reference intervals. Conclusions: This suggests that Tukey\nelimination should be preferred over the block D/R method for datasets similar\nto the one used in this study. These are predominantly new observations, as\nprevious literature has focused on the calculation technique and not discussed\noutlier elimination. This suggests the robust method is not advantageous over\nthe parametric method and therefore due to its complexity is not particularly\nuseful, contrary to CLSI Guidelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Specifically, we compare\nthe multivariate normal (MVN), finite mixture of normals (F-MON) and Dirichlet\nprocess mixture of normals (DP-MON) mixing distributions. The latter promises\nto be particularly flexible in respect to the shapes it can assume and unlike\nother semi-parametric approaches does not require that its complexity is fixed\nprior to estimation.

In this paper, we evaluate the\nperformance of the MVN, F-MON and DP-MON mixing distributions using simulated\ndata and real data sourced from a stated choice study on preferences for SAV\nservices in New York City.

Specifically, one module regresses a spatially consistent\nintermediate estimation by learning a deep multidimensional and cross-domain\nfeature representation; the other one constructs another intermediate\nestimation, which maintains the high-frequency textures, by propagating the\ninformation of the high-resolution view.

We define the Hamming polynomial of a demimatroid $M$, denoted by\n$W(x,y,t)$, as a generalization of the extended Hamming weight enumerator of a\nmatroid. The polynomial $W(x,y,t)$ is a specialization of the Tutte polynomial\nof $M$, and actually is equivalent to it. Guided by work of Johnsen, Roksvold\nand Verdure for matroids, we prove that Betti numbers of a demimatroid and its\nelongations determine the Hamming polynomial. Our results may be applied to\nsimplicial complexes since in a canonical way they can be viewed as\ndemimatroids. Furthermore, following work of Brylawski and Gordon, we show how\ndemimatroids may be generalized one step further, to combinatroids.

Since direct online policy learning usually harms user\nexperiences, it is more crucial to apply off-policy learning in real-world\napplications instead. Though there have been some existing works, most are\nfocusing on learning with one single historical policy. However, in practice,\nusually a number of parallel experiments, e.g. multiple AB tests, are performed\nsimultaneously. To make full use of such historical data, learning policies\nfrom multiple loggers becomes necessary. Motivated by this, in this paper, we\ninvestigate off-policy learning when the training data coming from multiple\nhistorical policies. Specifically, policies, e.g. neural networks, can be\nlearned directly from multi-logger data, with counterfactual estimators. In\norder to understand the generalization ability of such estimator better, we\nconduct generalization error analysis for the empirical risk minimization\nproblem. We then introduce the generalization error bound as the new risk\nfunction, which can be reduced to a constrained optimization problem. Finally,\nwe give the corresponding learning algorithm for the new constrained problem,\nwhere we can appeal to the minimax problems to control the constraints.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethods achieve better performances than the state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 01:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 08:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

In this situation, thermal cameras are the best\nsupplemental components, which capture images without depending on visible\nlight. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the visible-thermal\ncross-modality person re-identification (VT Re-ID) problem. In VT Re-ID, there\nare two knotty problems should be well handled, cross-modality discrepancy and\nintra-modality variations. To address these two issues, we propose focusing on\nenhancing the discriminative feature learning (EDFL) with two extreme simple\nmeans from two core aspects, (1) skip-connection for mid-level features\nincorporation to improve the person features with more discriminability and\nrobustness, and (2) dual-modality triplet loss to guide the training procedures\nby simultaneously considering the cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality\nvariations.

Existing algorithms for seed\nminimization mostly consider the non-adaptive setting, where all seed nodes are\nselected in one batch without observing how they may influence other users. In\nthis paper, we study seed minimization in the adaptive setting, where the seed\nnodes are selected in several batches, such that the choice of a batch may\nexploit information about the actual influence of the previous batches. We\npropose a novel algorithm, ASTI, which addresses the adaptive seed minimization\nproblem in $O\\Big(\\frac{\\eta \\cdot (m+n)}{\\varepsilon^2}\\ln n \\Big)$ expected\ntime and offers an approximation guarantee of $\\frac{(\\ln \\eta+1)^2}{(1 -\n(1-1/b)^b) (1-1/e)(1-\\varepsilon)}$ in expectation, where $\\eta$ is the\ntargeted number of influenced nodes, $b$ is size of each seed node batch, and\n$\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1)$ is a user-specified parameter. To the best of our\nknowledge, ASTI is the first algorithm that provides such an approximation\nguarantee without incurring prohibitive computation overhead.

Although solving POMDPs is computationally\nintractable, substantial advancements have been achieved in developing\napproximate POMDP solvers in the past two decades. However, computing robust\nsolutions for systems with complex dynamics remain challenging. Most on-line\nsolvers rely on a large number of forward-simulations and standard Monte-Carlo\nmethods to compute the expected outcomes of actions the robot can perform.

Of course, this issue exacerbates for problems with long planning\nhorizons. This paper aims to alleviate the above difficulty.

We first clarify\nthe number, spins, and parities of all particle species around the Minkowski\nbackground and find that some of those particle species are ghosts for generic\nchoices of parameters. For special choices of the parameters, on the other\nhand, those would-be ghosts become infinitely heavy and thus can be removed\nfrom the physical content of particle species. Imposing the conditions on the\ncoupling constants to eliminate the ghosts, we find new quadratic curvature\ntheories which are ghost-free around the Minkowski background for a range of\nparameters. A key feature of these theories is that there exist a non-ghost\nmassive spin-2 particle and a non-ghost massive spin-0 particle in the graviton\npropagator, as well as the massless spin-2 graviton. In the limit of the\ninfinite mass of the torsion, the Riemann-Cartan geometry reduces to the\nRiemannian geometry and thus the physical content of particle species coincides\nwith that of the well-known quadratic curvature theory in the metric formalism,\ni.e. a massive spin-2 ghost, a massive spin-0 particle and the massless spin-2\ngraviton. Ghost-freedom therefore sets, besides other constraints, an upper\nbound on the mass of the torsion. In addition to the above mentioned particle\nspecies, the ghost-free theory contains either the set of a massive spin-1 and\na massive spin-0 (Class I) or a couple of spin-1 (Class II).

There are two major ways to mitigate this problem: either\npreserving activations of the initial network during training with a new task;\nor restricting the new network activations to remain close to the initial ones.\nThe latter approach falls under the denomination of lifelong learning, where\nthe model is updated in a way that it performs well on both old and new tasks,\nwithout having access to the old task's training samples anymore. Recently,\napproaches like pruning networks for freeing network capacity during sequential\nlearning of tasks have been gaining in popularity. Such approaches allow\nlearning small networks while making redundant parameters available for the\nnext tasks. The common problem encountered with these approaches is that the\npruning percentage is hard-coded, irrespective of the number of samples, of the\ncomplexity of the learning task and of the number of classes in the dataset. We\npropose a method based on Bayesian optimization to perform adaptive\ncompression/pruning of the network and show its effectiveness in lifelong\nlearning.

Numerous graph-based algorithms rely on both information to achieve\nsuccess in supervised tasks, such as node classification and link prediction.\nHowever, node attributes could be missing or incomplete, which significantly\ndeteriorates the performance. The task of node attribute generation aims to\ngenerate attributes for those nodes whose attributes are completely unobserved.\nThis task benefits many real-world problems like profiling, node classification\nand graph data augmentation. To tackle this task, we propose a deep adversarial\nlearning based method to generate node attributes; called node attribute neural\ngenerator (NANG). NANG learns a unifying latent representation which is shared\nby both node attributes and graph structures and can be translated to different\nmodalities. We thus use this latent representation as a bridge to convert\ninformation from one modality to another. We further introduce practical\napplications to quantify the performance of node attribute generation.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets and the\nempirical results show that node attributes generated by the proposed method\nare high-qualitative and beneficial to other applications.

The impracticality of\nusing temperature as a control parameter to reach those large responses has\nmotivated the design of solid solutions with phase boundaries between different\npolar phases at temperatures (typically room temperature) significantly lower\nthan the paraelectric-ferroelectric critical temperature. The flat energy\nlandscapes close to these PTs give rise to polarization rotation under external\nstimuli, being responsible for the best piezoelectrics so far and a their huge\nmarket. But this approach requires complex chemistry to achieve\ntemperature-independent PT boundaries and often involves lead-containing\ncompounds. Here we report that such a bridging state is possible in thin films\nof chemically simple materials such as BaTiO3. A coexistence of tetragonal,\northorhombic and their bridging low-symmetry phases are shown to be responsible\nfor the continuous vertical polarization rotation, recreating a smear\nin-transition state and leading to giant temperature-independent dielectric\nresponse. These features are distinct from those of single crystals,\nmulti-domain crystals, ceramics or relaxor ferroelectrics, requiring a\ndifferent description.

We\npropose ProSeNet, an interpretable and steerable deep sequence model with\nnatural explanations derived from case-based reasoning. The prediction is\nobtained by comparing the inputs to a few prototypes, which are exemplar cases\nin the problem domain. For better interpretability, we define several criteria\nfor constructing the prototypes, including simplicity, diversity, and sparsity\nand propose the learning objective and the optimization procedure.

The recently proposed invertible\nnetworks can accurately reconstruct the input from its output, and have the\npotential to unravel the black-box representation. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel method to classify ASD and identify biomarkers for ASD using the\nconnectivity matrix calculated from fMRI as the input. Specifically, with\ninvertible networks, we explicitly determine the decision boundary and the\nprojection of data points onto the boundary. Like linear classifiers, the\ndifference between a point and its projection onto the decision boundary can be\nviewed as the explanation. We then define the importance as the explanation\nweighted by the gradient of prediction $w.r.t$ the input, and identify\nbiomarkers based on this importance measure. We perform a regression task to\nfurther validate our biomarker selection: compared to using all edges in the\nconnectivity matrix, using the top 10\\% important edges we generate a lower\nregression error on 6 different severity scores.

Repeated\ncoarse-graining produces a system of manageable size, whose properties can then\nbe explored by means of usual techniques for small systems.

This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering\nmethod by learning a shared generative latent representation that obeys a\nmixture of Gaussian distributions. The motivation is based on the fact that the\nmulti-view data share a common latent embedding despite the diversity among the\nviews. Specifically, benefited from the success of the deep generative\nlearning, the proposed model not only can extract the nonlinear features from\nthe views, but render a powerful ability in capturing the correlations among\nall the views.

We consider a\nbandwidth-limited fading multiple access channel (MAC) from the wireless\ndevices to the PS, and propose various techniques to implement distributed\nstochastic gradient descent (DSGD). We first propose a digital DSGD (D-DSGD)\nscheme, in which one device is selected opportunistically for transmission at\neach iteration based on the channel conditions; the scheduled device quantizes\nits gradient estimate to a finite number of bits imposed by the channel\ncondition, and transmits these bits to the PS in a reliable manner. Next,\nmotivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose a novel analog\ncommunication scheme, referred to as the compressed analog DSGD (CA-DSGD),\nwhere the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates while accumulating\nerror, and project the resultant sparse vector into a low-dimensional vector\nfor bandwidth reduction. Numerical results show that D-DSGD outperforms other\ndigital approaches in the literature; however, in general the proposed CA-DSGD\nalgorithm converges faster than the D-DSGD scheme and other schemes in the\nliterature, and reaches a higher level of accuracy. We have observed that the\ngap between the analog and digital schemes increases when the datasets of\ndevices are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Furthermore,\nthe performance of the CA-DSGD scheme is shown to be robust against imperfect\nchannel state information (CSI) at the devices.

The TESS and PLATO missions are expected to find vast numbers of new\ntransiting planet candidates.

We study the applicability of multicolour transit photometry in the\nvalidation of transiting planet candidates when the candidate signal arises\nfrom a real astrophysical source.

Our 1.4 GHz observations reveal the\npresence of eclipses of the pulsar's radio signal caused by the outflow of\nmaterial from the companion, for a few minutes around superior conjunction of\nthe pulsar. The very low companion mass, the observation of radio eclipses, and\nthe detection of time variations of the orbital period establish PSR J2055+3829\nas a `black widow' (BW) pulsar. Inspection of the radio signal from the pulsar\nduring ingress and egress phases shows that the eclipses in PSR J2055+3829 are\nasymmetric and variable, as is commonly observed in other similar systems. More\ngenerally, the orbital properties of the new pulsar are found to be very\nsimilar to those of other known eclipsing BW pulsars. No gamma-ray source is\ndetected at the location of the pulsar in recent \\textit{Fermi}-LAT source\ncatalogs. We used the timing ephemeris to search ten years of \\textit{Fermi}\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) data for gamma-ray pulsations, but were unable to\ndetect any, possibly because of the pulsar's large distance. We finally\ncompared the mass functions of eclipsing and non-eclipsing BW pulsars and\nconfirmed previous findings that eclipsing BWs have higher mass functions than\ntheir non-eclipsing counterparts. Larger inclinations could explain the higher\nmass functions of eclipsing BWs.

As it is not feasible to form a\nbackhaul (BH) by wiring all BSs to the core network, directional mmWave links\ncan be an attractive solution to form BH links, due to their large available\ncapacity. When small cells are powered on/off or traffic demands change, the BH\nmay require reconfiguration, leading to topology and traffic routing changes.\nIdeally, such reconfiguration should be seamless and should not impact existing\ntraffic. However, when using highly directional BH antennas which can be\ndynamically rotated to form new links, this can become time-consuming,\nrequiring the coordination of BH interface movements, link establishment and\ntraffic routing. In this paper, we propose greedy-based heuristic algorithms to\nsolve the BH reconfiguration problem in real-time. We numerically compare the\nproposed algorithms with the optimal solution obtained by solving a mixed\ninteger linear program (MILP) for smaller instances, and with a sub-optimal\nreduced MILP for larger instances.

As a third-order generalization of principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), its solution of searching for the locally maximum\nskewness direction is transformed into the problem of calculating the\neigenpairs (the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors) of a coskewness\ntensor. By combining a fixed-point method with an orthogonal constraint, it can\nprevent the new eigenpairs from converging to the same maxima that has been\ndetermined before. However, the eigenvectors of the supersymmetric tensor are\nnot inherently orthogonal in general, which implies that the results obtained\nby the search strategy used in PSA may unavoidably deviate from the actual\neigenpairs. In this paper, we propose a new nonorthogonal search strategy to\nsolve this problem and the new algorithm is named nonorthogonal principal\nskewness analysis (NPSA). The contribution of NPSA lies in the finding that the\nsearch space of the eigenvector to be determined can be enlarged by using the\northogonal complement of the Kronecker product of the previous one, instead of\nits orthogonal complement space. We give a detailed theoretical proof to\nillustrate why the new strategy can result in the more accurate eigenpairs.

ALICE observations provide a strong indication that a\nquark-gluon plasma is partly formed in high multiplicity events of both small\nand large colliding systems. Motivated by ALICE's results, we propose a new\ntest for hadronic interaction models used for analyzing\nultra-high-energy-cosmic-ray (UHECR) collisions with air nuclei. The test is\ngrounded in the almost equal column-energy density in UHECR-air collisions and\nlead-lead collisions at the LHC.

The costs are measured similar to the classical Page Migration\nProblem, i.e., answering a request induces costs proportional to the distance\nto the nearest server, and moving a server induces costs proportional to the\ndistance multiplied with a weight D.\n  We show that, in our model, no online algorithm can have a constant\ncompetitive ratio, i.e., one which is independent of the input length n, even\nif an augmented moving distance of (1+\\delta)m_s is allowed for the online\nalgorithm. Therefore we investigate a restriction of the power of the adversary\ndictating the sequence of requests: We demand locality of requests, i.e., that\nconsecutive requests come from points in the Euclidean space with distance\nbounded by some constant m_c. We show constant lower bounds on the\ncompetitiveness in this setting (independent of n, but dependent on k, m_s and\nm_c).\n  On the positive side, we present a deterministic online algorithm with\nbounded competitiveness when augmented moving distance and locality of requests\nis assumed.

The study focuses on the problem\nof rendezvous of two robots with lights.\n  There exist many different rendezvous algorithms that aim at finding the\nminimal number of colors needed to solve rendezvous in various synchrony models\n(e.g., FSYNC, SSYNC, ASYNC). While these rendezvous algorithms are typically\nvery simple, their analysis and proof of correctness tend to be extremely\ncomplex, tedious, and error-prone as impossibility results are based on subtle\ninteractions between robots activation schedules.\n  The paper presents a generic verification model written for the SPIN\nmodel-checker. In particular, we explain the subtle design decisions that allow\nto keep the search space finite and tractable, as well as prove several\nimportant theorems that support them. As a sanity check, we use the model to\nverify several known rendezvous algorithms in six different models of\nsynchrony. In each case, we find that the results obtained from the\nmodel-checker are consistent with the results known in the literature. The\nmodel-checker outputs a counter-example execution in every case that is known\nto fail.\n  In the course of developing and proving the validity of the model, we\nidentified several fundamental theorems, including the ability for a well\nchosen algorithm and ASYNC scheduler to produce an emerging property of memory\nin a system of oblivious mobile robots, and why it is not a problem for\nluminous rendezvous algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 13:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

This\nlarge sample of eclipsing hot subdwarfs with cool companions allowed us to\nderive a significant period distribution for hot subdwarfs with cool companions\nfor the first time showing that the period distribution is much broader than\npreviously thought and ideally suited to find the lowest mass companions to hot\nsubdwarf stars. In the future several new photometric surveys will be carried\nout, which will increase the sample of this project even more giving the\npotential to test many aspects of common envelope theory and binary evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 14:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

To\nprovide confidentiality and integrity even in the presence of such an\nadversary, a number of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been\ndeveloped. A TEE aims to protect data and code within its environment against\nhigh privileged adversaries, such as a malicious operating system or\nhypervisor.\n  While mechanisms exist to attest a TEE's integrity at load time, there are no\nmechanisms to attest its integrity at runtime. Additionally, work also exists\nthat discusses mechanisms to verify the runtime integrity of programs and\nsystem components. However, those verification mechanisms are themselves not\nprotected against attacks from a high privileged adversary.

For\nexample, the high dimensional channel could be decomposed into small amount of\nphysical parameters, e.g., angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD),\nmulti-path delay, Doppler shift, etc. As a consequence, transceiver techniques\nlike synchronization, channel estimation, beamforming, precoding, multi-user\naccess, etc., can be re-shaped with these physical parameters, as opposed to\nthose designed directly with channel state information (CSI). Interestingly,\nparameters like AoA/AoD and multi-path delay are frequency insensitive and thus\ncan be used to guide the down-link transmission from uplink training even for\nFDD systems.

These phenomena are traditionally studied as second-order phase\ntransitions where, at the critical threshold, the order parameter increases\nrapidly but continuously. In 2009, an extremely abrupt transition was found for\na network growth process where links compete for addition in attempt to delay\npercolation. This observation of \"explosive percolation\" was ultimately\nrevealed to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, yet with\nvery atypical finite-size scaling, and it started a surge of work on explosive\nphenomena and their consequences. Many related models are now shown to yield\ndiscontinuous percolation transitions and even hybrid transitions. Explosive\npercolation enables many other features such as multiple giant components,\nmodular structures, discrete scale invariance and non-self-averaging, relating\nto properties found in many real phenomena such as explosive epidemics,\nelectric breakdowns and the emergence of molecular life.

The classical\nfield obeys an inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation sourced by the renormalised\nexpectation value of the squared quantum field in a Hadamard state, $\\langle\n\\Psi| \\Phi^2 \\Psi \\rangle$. Thus, the system of equations for the scalar fields\nreminisces of the semi-classical Einstein field equations with a Klein-Gordon\nfield, where classical geometry is sourced by the renormalised stress-energy\ntensor of the quantum field, and the Klein-Gordon equation depends on the\nmetric explicitly.

For those tubes, the cylindrical shape is metastable and it is\ninteresting to investigate the energy barrier for jumping from one\nconfiguration to another. We calculate the energy barrier for SWNT collapse by\nconsidering a transition pathway that consists of an initial local deformation\nthat subsequently propagates itself along the SWNT axis. This leads to finite\nand physically meaningful energy barriers in the limit of infinite nanotubes.\nYet, such barriers are surprisingly large (tens of eV) and therefore virtually\nunsurmountable, which essentially prevents the thermal collapse of a metastable\ncylindrical at any reasonable temperatures.

The framework\noriginates from the realization that there is a meaningful division of temporal\ncommunication networks into six dynamic classes, where the class of a network\nis determined by its generating process. In particular, each class is\ncharacterized by a fundamental structure: a temporal-topological network motif,\nwhich corresponds to the network representation of communication events in that\nclass of network. These fundamental structures constrain network\nconfigurations: only certain configurations are possible within a dynamic\nclass. In this way the framework presented here highlights strong constraints\non network structures, which simplify analyses and shape network flows.\nTherefore the fundamental structures hold the potential to impact how we model\ntemporal networks overall. I argue below that networks within the same class\ncan be meaningfully compared, and modeled using similar techniques, but that\nintegrating statistics across networks belonging to separate classes is not\nmeaningful in general.

However, simulating\nand optimizing their vectorial fields, which are associated with billions of\nadjustable parameters in the optical element, are difficult to do, because of\nthe issues of numerical stability and the highly-demanding computational cost.\nTo address this problem, this research proposes an applicable algorithm by\nmeans of a wave-vector (k) series approximation of vectorial optical fields.

The\nprogression of the functional mechanism indicates the transformation of the\nintermediate virtual electron into the real particle state. As a result, the\ninitial second order process with accordance to the fine structure constant in\nthe light field productively splits into two consequent first order formations:\nthe laser-stimulated Compton effect and the laser-assisted scattering of an\nelectron on a nucleus. It is important to emphasize that the resonance\nescalation possesses a possibility to develop within two reaction channels.\nTherefore, the first channel - delineates the occurrence that correlates to the\nspontaneous photon emission by an electron with subsequent scattering on a\nnucleus. The second channel - illustrates the configuration corresponding to\nthe electron scattering on a nucleus with consecutive spontaneous photon\nemission in the wave field. Moreover, the spontaneous photon radiation angle\nallocates a single-valued dependency with the resonant frequency for the first\nchannel in contrast to the second displacement that categorizes a composite\narea with three various resonant frequency magnitudes for the particular\nemission angle diapason. The project data analysis proposes that the reaction\nchannels do not interfere within the whole range of observation. To summarize,\nthe investigation calculates that the particular cross-section within the\nresonant ambience significantly exceeds the according cross-section in the\napproximation of an external field absence. In conclusion, numerous scientific\nfacilities with specialization in pulsed laser radiation (SLAC, FAIR, XFEL,\nELI, XCELS) may experimentally validate the computational estimations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 15:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

One of the keys to understanding the origin of the Ap stars and\ntheir significance in the general context of stellar astrophysics is the\nconsideration of the most extreme properties displayed by some of them. In that\ncontext, HD 965 is particularly interesting, as it combines some of the most\npronounced chemical peculiarities with one of the longest rotation periods\nknown.\n  Aims. We characterise the variations of the magnetic field of the Ap star HD\n965 and derive constraints about its structure.\n  Methods. We combine published measurements of the mean longitudinal field\n<Bz> of HD 965 with new determinations of this field moment from circular\nspectropolarimetry obtained at the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special\nAstrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. For the mean\nmagnetic field modulus <B>, literature data are complemented by the analysis of\nESO archive spectra.\n  Results. We present the first determination of the rotation period of HD 965,\nP = (16.5+/-0.5) y. HD 965 is only the third Ap star with a period longer than\n10 years for which magnetic field measurements have been obtained over more\nthan a full cycle. The variation curve of <Bz> is well approximated by a cosine\nwave. <B> does not show any significant variation. The observed behaviour of\nthese field moments is well represented by a simple model consisting of the\nsuperposition of collinear dipole, quadrupole and octupole. The distribution of\nneodymium over the surface of HD 965 is highly non-uniform. The element appears\nconcentrated around the magnetic poles, especially the negative one.\n  Conclusions. The shape of the longitudinal magnetic variation curve of HD 965\nindicates that its magnetic field is essentially symmetric about an axis\npassing through the centre of the star. Overall, as far as its magnetic field\nis concerned, HD 965 appears similar to the bulk of the long-period Ap stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 15:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

We\nanalyze the combinatorial interaction of ligands loaded on polymeric scaffolds,\nin both a continuum and discrete setting, and compare it with multivalent\nscaffolds with fixed number of binding sites. The quantity of interest is the\nabundance of ligand interaction possibilities---the catalytic potential\n$Q$---in a configurational mixture. Upon increasing scaffold abundance,\nscaffolding systems are known to first increase opportunities for ligand\ninteraction and then to shut them down as ligands become isolated on distinct\nscaffolds. The polymerizing system stands out in that the dependency of $Q$ on\nprotomer concentration switches from being dominated by a first order to a\nsecond order term within a range determined by the polymerization affinity.\nThis behavior boosts $Q$ beyond that of any multivalent scaffold system. In\naddition, the subsequent drop-off is considerably mitigated in that $Q$\ndecreases with half the power in protomer concentration than for any\nmultivalent scaffold. We explain this behavior in terms of how the\nconcentration profile of the polymer length distribution adjusts to changes in\nprotomer concentration and affinity.

In the multi-label classification problem, unlike the\ntraditional multi-class classification setting, each instance can be\nsimultaneously associated with a subset of labels. The focus of thesis is on\nthe development of novel techniques for collaborative filtering and multi-label\nclassification.\n  We propose a novel method of constructing a hierarchical bi-level maximum\nmargin matrix factorization to handle matrix completion of ordinal rating\nmatrix. Taking the cue from the alternative formulation of support vector\nmachines, a novel loss function is derived by considering proximity as an\nalternative criterion instead of margin maximization criterion for matrix\nfactorization framework.\n  We extended the concept of matrix factorization for yet another important\nproblem of machine learning namely multi-label classification which deals with\nthe classification of data with multiple labels. We propose a novel\npiecewise-linear embedding method with a low-rank constraint on parametrization\nto capture nonlinear intrinsic relationships that exist in the original feature\nand label space. We also study the embedding of labels together with the group\ninformation with an objective to build an efficient multi-label classifier. We\nassume the existence of a low-dimensional space onto which the feature vectors\nand label vectors can be embedded. We ensure that labels belonging to the same\ngroup share the same sparsity pattern in their low-rank representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

The bandgap of the\nCIGS layer was either sinusoidally or linearly graded, and the solar cell was\nmodeled to have a metallic backreflector corrugated periodically along a fixed\ndirection in the plane. The model predicts that specially tailored bandgap\ngrading can significantly improve the efficiency, with much smaller\nimprovements due to the periodic corrugations. An efficiency of 27.7% with the\nconventional 2200-nm-thick CIGS layer is predicted with sinusoidal bandgap\ngrading, in comparison to 22% efficiency obtained experimentally with\nhomogeneous bandgap. Furthermore, the inclusion of sinusoidal grading increases\nthe predicted efficiency to 22.89% with just a 600-nm-thick CIGS layer. These\nhigh efficiencies arise due to a large electron-hole-pair generation rate in\nthe narrow-bandgap regions and the elevation of the open-circuit voltage due to\na wider bandgap in the region toward the front surface of the CIGS layer.
