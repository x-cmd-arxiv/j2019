When the diffusion is\ninduced by both the initial field and external input, then the field and\nsources can be recovered from the subsampled observations, however, by imposing\nband-limiting constraints on either the initial field or external input. For\nheat diffusion on graphs, we can compensate for the unobserved vertices with\nthe temporal samples at the observed vertices. If the observations are\nnoiseless, then the recovery is exact.

The high accuracy of this self-learning PQMC technique is\ndemonstrated for a paradigmatic sign-problem-free model, namely, the\nferromagnetic quantum Ising chain, showing very precise agreement with the\npredictions of the Jordan-Wigner theory and of loop quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations performed in the low-temperature limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 16:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

The basic conjecture explored in this paper is that\nthe planet formation process will act to distribute planetary masses in order\nto achieve a minimum energy state. The resulting minimum energy configuration\n--- subject to the constraint of constant angular momentum --- corresponds to\ncircular orbits confined to a plane, with nearly equal planetary masses (as\nobserved).

In such a scenario, there is typically a tradeoff between the amount of\npre-processing and the amount of data to be transmitted. We model such a system\nby considering two non-preemptive queues in tandem whose service times are\nindependent over time but the transmission service time is dependent on the\ncomputation service time in mean value. The first queue is in M/GI/1/1 form\nwith a single server, memoryless exponential arrivals, general independent\nservice and no extra buffer to save incoming status update packets. The second\nqueue is in GI/M/1/2* form with a single server receiving packets from the\nfirst queue, memoryless service and a single data buffer to save incoming\npackets. Additionally, mean service times of the first and second queues are\ndependent through a deterministic monotonic function. We perform stationary\ndistribution analysis in this system and obtain closed form expressions for\naverage age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI. Our numerical results\nillustrate the analytical findings and highlight the tradeoff between average\nAoI and average peak AoI generated by the tandem nature of the queueing system\nwith dependent service times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 17:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

We show with two simple\nexamples that in spintronics devices which have both a spin-orbit interaction\nand magnetization, standard coarse graining can easily obtain diffusion\nequations which fail to conserve electronic charge. The same failure can occur\nin systems with both a spin-orbit interaction and orbital polarization.

The main goal of this article is to develop the tools needed\nfor optimizing over a set of flags, which is a smooth manifold called the flag\nmanifold, and it contains the Grassmannian as the simplest special case. We\nwill derive closed-form analytic expressions for various differential geometric\nobjects required for Riemannian optimization algorithms on the flag manifold;\nintroducing various systems of extrinsic coordinates that allow us to\nparameterize points, metrics, tangent spaces, geodesics, distance, parallel\ntransport, gradients, Hessians in terms of matrices and matrix operations; and\nthereby permitting us to formulate steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and\nNewton algorithms on the flag manifold using only standard numerical linear\nalgebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 17:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 17:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

In this work, we tackle these two problems separately, by explicitly\nlearning latent representations that can accelerate reinforcement learning from\nimages. We propose the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) algorithm: a\nsample-efficient and high-performing RL algorithm for learning policies for\ncomplex continuous control tasks directly from high-dimensional image inputs.\nSLAC provides a novel and principled approach for unifying stochastic\nsequential models and RL into a single method, by learning a compact latent\nrepresentation and then performing RL in the model's learned latent space.

In this work, we alleviate the NAS search cost down\nto less than 3 hours, while achieving state-of-the-art image classification\nresults under mobile latency constraints.

Although the relic-shock connection has\nbeen consolidated in recent years by a number of observations, the details of\nthe mechanisms leading to the formation of relativistic particles in this\nenvironment are still not well understood. The diffusive shock acceleration\n(DSA) theory is a commonly adopted scenario to explain the origin of cosmic\nrays at astrophysical shocks, including those in radio relics in galaxy\nclusters. However, in a few specific cases it has been shown that the energy\ndissipated by cluster shocks is not enough to reproduce the luminosity of the\nrelics via DSA of thermal particles. Studies based on samples of radio relics\nare required to further address this limitation of the mechanism. In this\npaper, we focus on ten well-studied radio relics with underlying shocks\nobserved in the X-rays and calculate the electron acceleration efficiency of\nthese shocks that is necessary to reproduce the observed radio luminosity of\nthe relics. We find that in general the standard DSA cannot explain the origin\nof the relics if electrons are accelerated from the thermal pool with an\nefficiency significantly smaller than 10%.

Although all of the estimates are affected by large uncertainties,\nthe masses inferred using the three methods are compatible if the dimensionless\nscale factor $f$ (linked to the unknown kinematics and geometry of the Broad\nLine Region) is assumed to be larger than one. For the majority of the sources,\nthe comparison between the results coming from the three methods favors small\nspin values. To check the goodness of the KERRBB results, we compared them with\nthose inferred with other models, such as AGNSED, a model that also accounts\nfor the emission originating from an X-ray corona: using two sources with a\ngood data coverage in the X band, we find that the masses estimated with the\ntwo models differ at most by a factor of $\\sim 0.2$ dex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 08:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Determining the properties of these objects -- in\nparticular, initial masses and density profiles -- is relevant to both\nastronomy and dark matter physics. However, most direct measures of mass cannot\nbe applied to tidal debris, as the systems of interest are no longer in\nequilibrium. Since phase-space density is conserved during adiabatic phase\nmixing, Liouville's theorem provides a connection between stellar kinematics as\nmeasured by observatories such as Gaia and the original mass of the disrupted\nsystem. Accurately recovering the phase-space density is complicated by\nuncertainties resulting from measurement errors and orbital integration, which\nboth effectively inject entropy into the system, preferentially decreasing the\nmeasured density. In this paper, we demonstrate that these two issues can be\novercome. First, we measure the phase-space density of the globular cluster M4\nin Gaia data, and use Liouville's theorem to derive its mass. We then show\nthat, for tidally disrupted systems, the orbital parameters and thus\nphase-space density can be inferred by minimizing the phase-space entropy of\ncold stellar streams. This work is therefore a proof of principle that true\nphase-space density can be measured and the original properties of the star\ncluster reconstructed in systems of astrophysical interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Dense stellar systems - globular and nuclear\nstar clusters - are natural sites of compact object binary formation and\nevolution towards merger. Here we explore a new channel for the production of\nbinary mergers in clusters, in which the tidal field of the cluster secularly\ndrives the binary to high eccentricity (even in the absence of a central\nmassive black hole) until gravitational wave emission becomes important. We\nemploy the recently developed secular theory of cluster tide-driven binary\nevolution to compute present day merger rates for BH-BH, NS-BH and NS-NS\nbinaries, varying cluster potential and central concentration of the binary\npopulation (but ignoring cluster evolution and stellar flybys for now). Unlike\nother mechanisms, this new dynamical channel can produce a significant number\nof mergers out to cluster-centric distances of several pc.

The background\nhydrodynamic model is based on the neutrino hydrodynamic simulation of a 8.8\n\\Msun progenitor star. We find that CNO commences after some 100 ms post\nbounce. Before this, CNO is suppressed by matter-induced decoherence. In the\ninverted mass hierarchy, the spectrum of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ becomes softer after the\nonset of CNO. To evaluate the detectability of this modification, we define a\nhardness ratio between the number of high energy neutrino events and low energy\nneutrino events adopting a fixed critical energy. We show that Hyper-Kamiokande\n(HK) can distinguish the effect of CNO for supernova distances out to $\\sim 10$\nkpc. On the other hand, for the normal mass hierarchy, the spectrum of $\\nu_e$\nbecomes softer after the onset of CNO, and we show that DUNE can distinguish\nthis feature for supernova distances out to $\\sim 10$ kpc. More work is\nnecessary to optimize the best value of critical energy for maximum\nsensitivity. We also show that if the spectrum of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ in HK becomes\nsofter due to CNO, the spectrum of $\\nu_e$ in DUNE becomes harder, and vice\nversa. This synergistic observations in $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ and $\\nu_e$, by HK and\nDUNE respectively, will be an intriguing opportunity to test the occurrence of\nCNO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 18:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 03:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 01:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

In the most common scenarios, NSCs form\nin-situ from the galaxy's central gas reservoir, through merging of globular\nclusters (GCs), or through a combination of the two. As the scenarios pose\ndifferent expectations for angular momentum and stellar population properties\nof the NSC in comparison to the host galaxy and the GC system, it is necessary\nto characterise the stellar light, NSC and GCs simultaneously. The large NSC\n(r$_\\rm{eff} = 66$ pc) and rich GC system of the early-type Fornax cluster\ngalaxy FCC47 (NGC1336) render this galaxy an ideal laboratory to constrain NSC\nformation. Using MUSE science verification data assisted by adaptive optics, we\nobtained maps for the stellar kinematics and for stellar-population properties\nof FCC47. We extracted the spectra of the central NSC and determined\nline-of-sight velocities of 24 GCs and metallicities of five. FCC47 shows two\ndecoupled components (KDCs): a rotating disk and the NSC. Our orbit-based\ndynamical Schwarzschild model revealed that the NSC is a distinct kinematic\nfeature and it constitutes the peak of metallicity and old ages in the galaxy.\nThe main body consists of two counter-rotating populations and is dominated by\na more metal-poor population. The GC system is bimodal with a dominant\nmetal-poor population and the total GC system mass is $\\sim 17\\%$ of the NSC\nmass ($\\sim$ 7 $\\times$ $10^8 M_\\odot$). The rotation, high metallicity and\nhigh mass of the NSC cannot be uniquely explained by GC-inspiral and most\nlikely requires additional, but quickly quenched, in-situ formation. The\npresence of two KDCs most probably are evidence of a major merger that has\naltered the structure of FCC47 significantly, indicating the important role of\ngalaxy mergers in forming the complex kinematics in the galaxy-NSC system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 18:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The\nstrength and temporal modulation of SPMIs are primarily set by the magnetic\ntopology of the host star and the orbital characteristics of the planet. As a\nresult, SPMI signals can be modulated over the rotational period of the star,\nthe orbital period of the planet, or a complex combination of the two. The\ndetection of SPMI thus have to rely on multiple-epochs and multiple-wavelengths\nobservational campaigns.

Due to the limitations originated form the JRC operation,\ncommunication channel may encounter unwanted amplitude variations. This\nunwanted modulation normally affects the communication performance by its\nnature, due to the fades on radiated signal amplitude towards the direction of\ncommunication. However, the effect of this unintentional modulation on\ncommunication channel is yet to be investigated. In this paper, the\ncommunication channel for JRC capable phase-coded coherent MIMO radars is\nanalyzed and investigated under additive white Gaussian noise and\nRayleigh/Rician fading conditions.

In no small part, this has been due to the fact\nthat causal models allow one to simultaneously leverage data and expert\nknowledge to remove discriminatory effects from predictions. However, one of\nthe primary assumptions in causal modeling is that you know the causal graph.\nThis introduces a new opportunity for bias, caused by misspecifying the causal\nmodel. One common way for misspecification to occur is via unmeasured\nconfounding: the true causal effect between variables is partially described by\nunobserved quantities. In this work we design tools to assess the sensitivity\nof fairness measures to this confounding for the popular class of non-linear\nadditive noise models (ANMs).

Mixed-frequency VARs deal with\ndata sampled at different frequencies while remaining within the realms of\nVARs.

Occurring over many different temporal and\nspatial scales, the first stage of local invasion is the secretion of\nmatrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) and the resulting degradation of the\nextra-cellular matrix (ECM). This process creates space in which the cells can\ninvade and thus enlarge the tumour. As a tumour increases in malignancy, the\ncancer cells adopt the ability to mutate into secondary cell subpopulations\ngiving rise to a heterogeneous tumour. This new cell subpopulation often\ncarries higher invasive qualities and permits a quicker spread of the tumour.\nBuilding upon the recent multiscale modelling framework for cancer invasion\nwithin a fibrous ECM introduced in Shuttleworth and Trucu (2019), in this paper\nwe consider the process of local invasion by a heterotypic tumour consisting of\ntwo cancer cell populations mixed with a two-phase ECM. To that end, we address\nthe double feedback link between the tissue-scale cancer dynamics and the\ncell-scale molecular processes through the development of a two-part modelling\nframework that crucially incorporates the multiscale dynamic redistribution of\noriented fibres occurring within a two-phase extra-cellular matrix and combines\nthis with the multiscale leading edge dynamics exploring key matrix-degrading\nenzymes molecular processes along the tumour interface that drive the movement\nof the cancer boundary. The modelling framework will be accompanied by\ncomputational results that explore the effects of the underlying fibre network\non the overall pattern of cancer invasion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 23:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

DE is a simple yet powerful\nevolutionary algorithm that has been used successfully to optimize various\nreal-world problems. Since it was introduced, many researchers have developed\nnew methods for DE, and one of them makes use of a mutation based on the Cauchy\ndistribution to increase the convergence speed of DE. The method monitors the\nresults of each individual in the selection operator and performs the Cauchy\nmutation on consecutively failed individuals, which generates mutant vectors by\nperturbing the best individual with the Cauchy distribution. Therefore, the\nmethod can locate the consecutively failed individuals to new positions close\nto the best individual. Although this approach is interesting, it fails to take\ninto account establishing a balance between exploration and exploitation. In\nthis paper, we propose a sigmoid based parameter control that alters the\nfailure threshold for performing the Cauchy mutation in a time-varying\nschedule, which can establish a good ratio between exploration and\nexploitation.

Methods for\ncreating semantic parsers, however, rely either on large amounts of data or on\nengineered lexical features and parsing rules, which has limited their\napplication in robotics. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that\nleverages neural semantic parsing methods in combination with contextual word\nembeddings to enable the training of a semantic parser with little data and\nwithout domain specific parser engineering. Key to our approach is the use of\nan anonymized target representation which is more easily learned by the parser.\nIn most cases, this simplified representation can trivially be transformed into\nan executable format, and in others the parse can be completed through further\ninteraction with the user. We evaluate this approach in the context of the\nRoboCup@Home General Purpose Service Robot task, where we have collected a\ncorpus of paraphrased versions of commands from the standardized command\ngenerator.

Conventional 2D\nCNNs have achieved good performance on image inpainting but often lead to\ntemporally inconsistent results where frames will flicker when applied to\nvideos (see\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Vh1HDBjD0&list=PLPoVtv-xp_dL5uckIzz1PKwNjg1yI0I94&index=1);\n3D CNNs can capture temporal information but are computationally intensive and\nhard to train. In this paper, we present a novel component termed Learnable\nGated Temporal Shift Module (LGTSM) for video inpainting models that could\neffectively tackle arbitrary video masks without additional parameters from 3D\nconvolutions. LGTSM is designed to let 2D convolutions make use of neighboring\nframes more efficiently, which is crucial for video inpainting. Specifically,\nin each layer, LGTSM learns to shift some channels to its temporal neighbors so\nthat 2D convolutions could be enhanced to handle temporal information.\nMeanwhile, a gated convolution is applied to the layer to identify the masked\nareas that are poisoning for conventional convolutions.

The model is a coupled system of an elliptic equation, a\nparabolic equation and an ordinary differential equation. It incorporates the\ncell location under the presence of time delay, with the tumor boundary as a\nfree boundary. A parameter $\\mu$ in the model is proportional to the\n\"aggressiveness\" of the tumor. It is proved that there exists a unique\nclassical radially symmetric stationary solution $(\\sigma_*, p_*, R_*)$ which\nis stable for any $\\mu > 0$ with respect to all radially symmetric\nperturbations (c.f. \\cite{delay1}). However, under non-radially symmetric\nperturbations, we prove that there exists a critical value $\\mu_*$, such that\nif $\\mu<\\mu_*$ then the stationary solution $(\\sigma_*, p_*, R_*)$ is linearly\nstable; whereas if $\\mu>\\mu_*$ the stationary solution is unstable. It is\nactually unrealistic to expect the problem to be stable for large tumor\naggressiveness parameter, therefore our result is more reasonable. Furthermore,\nwe established that adding the time delay in the model would result in a larger\nstationary tumor, and if the tumor aggressiveness parameter is larger, then the\ntime delay would have a greater impact on the size of the tumor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 03:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 19:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Multiple methods have been proposed for\naddressing this problem. We discuss several of them, and compare their\npredictive and computational performance in several scenarios.\n  We then propose solving this problem using an adaptive partitioning emulator\n(APE). The new approach is motivated by the idea that most computer models are\nonly complex in particular regions of the input space. By taking a\ndata-adaptive approach to the development of a design, and choosing to\npartition the space in the regions of highest variability, we obtain a higher\ndensity of points in these regions and hence accurate prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 05:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

A number of attack detection methods have been proposed,\nhowever they are characterized by a low detection rate, a substantial false\npositive rate, or are system specific. In this paper, we study an attack\ndetection method based on simple and lightweight neural networks, namely, 1D\nconvolutions and autoencoders. We apply these networks to both the time and\nfrequency domains of the collected data and discuss pros and cons of each\napproach. We evaluate the suggested method on three popular public datasets and\nachieve detection rates matching or exceeding previously published detection\nresults, while featuring small footprint, short training and detection times,\nand generality. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PCA, which, given\nproper data preprocessing and feature selection, can provide high attack\ndetection scores in many settings. Finally, we study the proposed method's\nrobustness against adversarial attacks, that exploit inherent blind spots of\nneural networks to evade detection while achieving their intended physical\neffect. Our results show that the proposed method is robust to such evasion\nattacks: in order to evade detection, the attacker is forced to sacrifice the\ndesired physical impact on the system. This finding suggests that neural\nnetworks trained under the constraints of the laws of physics can be trusted\nmore than networks trained under more flexible conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 07:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 16:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Second, we consider landscapes as equivalent if they allow the\nsame (improving) local search moves; we show that a minimal constraint graph\nstill exists, but is NP-hard to compute.\n  We then develop several techniques to bound the length of any sequence of\nlocal search moves. We show that such a bound can be obtained from the\nnumerical values of the constraints in the representation, and show how this\nbound may be tightened by considering equivalent representations. In the binary\nBoolean case, we prove that a degree 2 or tree-structured constraint graph\ngives a quadratic bound on the number of improving moves made by any local\nsearch; hence, any landscape that can be represented by such a model will be\ntractable for any form of local search.\n  Finally, we build two families of examples to show that the conditions in our\ntractability results are essential. With domain size three, even just a path of\nbinary constraints can model a landscape with an exponentially long sequence of\nimproving moves.

The present work focuses on performing visual\nanalytics to evaluate the value of any kind of event occurring in a sports\nmatch with a continuous parameter space. Here, the continuous parameter space\ninvolves the time, location, score, and other parameters. Because the\nspatiotemporal data used in such analytics is a low-level representation and\nhas a very large size, however, traditional analytics may need to discretize\nthe continuous parameter space (e.g., subdivide the playing area) or use a\nlocal feature to limit the analysis to specific events (e.g., only shots).\nThese approaches make evaluation impossible for any kind of event with a\ncontinuous parameter space. To solve this problem, we consider a whole match as\na Markov chain of significant events, so that event values can be estimated\nwith a continuous parameter space by solving the Markov chain with a machine\nlearning model. The significant events are first extracted by considering the\ntime-varying distribution of players to represent the whole match. Then, the\nextracted events are redefined as different states with the continuous\nparameter space and built as a Markov chain so that a Markov reward process can\nbe applied.

The present paper considers the\nprospects of providing a similar extension of the Levi Identity (LI), in which\nthe direction of definition runs the other way. We restrict our attention here\nto the three classic iterated revision operators--natural, restrained and\nlexicographic, for which we provide here the first collective characterisation\nin the literature, under the appellation of `elementary' operators. We consider\ntwo prima facie plausible ways of extending (LI). The first proposal involves\nthe use of the rational closure operator to offer a `reductive' account of\niterated revision in terms of iterated contraction. The second, which doesn't\ncommit to reductionism, was put forward some years ago by Nayak et al. We\nestablish that, for elementary revision operators and under mild assumptions\nregarding contraction, Nayak's proposal is equivalent to a new set of\npostulates formalising the claim that contraction by $\\neg A$ should be\nconsidered to be a kind of `mild' revision by $A$. We then show that these, in\nturn, under slightly weaker assumptions, jointly amount to the conjunction of a\npair of constraints on the extension of (HI) that were recently proposed in the\nliterature. Finally, we consider the consequences of endorsing both suggestions\nand show that this would yield an identification of rational revision with\nnatural revision. We close the paper by discussing the general prospects for\ndefining iterated revision in terms of iterated contraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 08:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Due to the centrality of guarding problems\nin the field of computational geometry, much effort has been invested\nthroughout the years in trying to resolve this conjecture. Despite some\nprogress (surveyed below), the conjecture remains unresolved to date. In this\npaper, we confirm the conjecture for the important case of weakly visible\npolygons, by presenting a $(2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for\nguarding such a polygon using vertex guards. A simple polygon $P$ is weakly\nvisible if it has an edge $e$, such that every point in $P$ is visible from\nsome point on $e$. We also present a $(2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm\nfor guarding a weakly visible polygon $P$, where guards may be placed anywhere\non $P$'s boundary (except in the interior of the edge $e$). Finally, we present\na $3c$-approximation algorithm for vertex guarding a polygon $P$ that is weakly\nvisible from a chord, given a subset $G$ of $P$'s vertices that guards $P$'s\nboundary whose size is bounded by $c$ times the size of a minimum such subset.\n  Our algorithms are based on an in-depth analysis of the geometric properties\nof the regions that remain unguarded after placing guards at the vertices to\nguard the polygon's boundary.

The respective decision problem is NP-hard [Bienstock, '91]. In\ncontrast to theory and the topological setting, the geometric setting did not\nreceive a lot of attention in practice. Prior work [Radermacher et al.,\nALENEX'18] is limited to the crossing-minimization in geometric graphs with\nless than $200$ edges. The described heuristics base on the primitive operation\nof moving a single vertex $v$ to its crossing-minimal position, i.e., the\nposition in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that minimizes the number of crossings on edges\nincident to $v$.\n  In this paper, we introduce a technique to speed-up the computation by a\nfactor of $20$. This is necessary but not sufficient to cope with graphs with a\nfew thousand edges. In order to handle larger graphs, we drop the condition\nthat each vertex $v$ has to be moved to its crossing-minimal position and\ncompute a position that is only optimal with respect to a small random subset\nof the edges. In our theoretical contribution, we consider drawings that\ncontain for each edge $uv \\in E$ and each position $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ for $v$\n$o(|E|)$ crossings. In this case, we prove that with a random subset of the\nedges of size $\\Theta(k \\log k)$ the co-crossing number of a degree-$k$ vertex\n$v$, i.e., the number of edge pairs $uv \\in E, e \\in E$ that do not cross, can\nbe approximated by an arbitrary but fixed factor $\\delta$ with high\nprobability. In our experimental evaluation, we show that the randomized\napproach reduces the number of crossings in graphs with up to $13\\,000$ edges\nconsiderably. The evaluation suggests that depending on the degree-distribution\ndifferent strategies result in the fewest number of crossings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 08:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The numerical challenge for this model is the designing of a\nnumerical scheme which is stable for both the Stokes-dominated (high\npermeability) and the Darcy-dominated (low permeability) equations. In this\npaper, we solve the Brinkman model in $n$ dimensions ($n = 2, 3$) by using the\nmixed discontinuous Galerkin (MDG) method, which meets this challenge. This MDG\nmethod is based on the pseudostress-velocity formulation and uses a\ndiscontinuous piecewise polynomial pair\n$\\underline{\\bm{\\mathcal{P}}}_{k+1}^{\\mathbb{S}}$-$\\bm{\\mathcal{P}}_k$ $(k \\geq\n0)$, where the stress field is symmetric.

It is possible to accurately measure the masses of the white dwarfs\n(WDs) in the Hyades cluster using gravitational redshift, because the radial\nvelocity of the stars can be obtained independently of spectroscopy from\nastrometry and the cluster has a low velocity dispersion. Aims. We aim to\nobtain an accurate measurement of the Hyades WD masses by determining the\nmass-to-radius ratio (M/R) from the observed gravitational redshift, and to\ncompare them with masses derived from other methods. Methods. We analyse\narchive high-resolution UVES-VLT spectra of six WDs belonging to the Hyades to\nmeasure their Doppler shift, from which M/R is determined after subtracting the\nastrometric radial velocity. We estimate the radii using Gaia photometry as\nwell as literature data. Results. The M/R error associated to the gravitational\nredshift measurement is about 5%. The radii estimates, evaluated with different\nmethods, are in very good agreement, though they can differ by up to 4%\ndepending on the quality of the data. The masses based on gravitational\nredshift are systematically smaller than those derived from other methods, by a\nminimum of $\\sim 0.02$ up to 0.05 solar masses. While this difference is within\nour measurement uncertainty, the fact that it is systematic indicates a likely\nreal discrepancy between the different methods. Conclusions. We show that the\nM/R derived from gravitational redshift measurements is a powerful tool to\ndetermine the masses of the Hyades WDs and could reveal interesting properties\nof their atmospheres. The technique can be improved by using dedicated\nspectrographs, and can be extended to other clusters, making it unique in its\nability to accurately and empirically determine the masses of WDs in open\nclusters. At the same time we prove that gravitational redshift in WDs agrees\nwith the predictions of stellar evolution models to within a few percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 09:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

However, to unlock the\nfull potential of these anomalies for constraining the processing, mixing, and\ntransport of material in the disk it is essential to identify the main\ncomponents responsible for producing planetary-scale isotope variations, and to\ninvestigate how they relate to the isotopic heterogeneity inherited from the\nSolar System's parental molecular cloud. To address these issues we measured\nthe Ti and Sr isotopic compositions of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the\nAllende CV3 chondrite, as well as acid leachates and an insoluble residue from\nthe Murchison CM2 chondrite, and combine these results with literature data for\npresolar grains, hibonites, chondrules, and bulk meteorites. Our analysis\nreveals that the mineral-scale nebular isotopic heterogeneity as sampled by\nleachates and presolar grains is largely decoupled from the planetary-scale\nisotope anomalies. Combining isotope anomaly data for a large number of\nelements reveals that the difference between non-carbonaceous (NC) and\ncarbonaceous (CC) meteorites is the product of mixing between NC material and a\nnebular reservoir (termed IC) whose isotopic composition is similar to that of\nCAIs, but whose chemical composition is similar to bulk chondrites. In our\npreferred model, the distinct isotopic compositions of these two nebular\nreservoirs reflect an inherited heterogeneity of the solar system's parental\nmolecular cloud core, which therefore has never been fully homogenized during\ncollapse. Planetary-scale isotopic anomalies are thus caused by variable mixing\nof isotopically distinct primordial disk reservoirs, the selective processing\nof these reservoirs in different nebular environments, and the heterogeneous\ndistribution of the thereby forming nebular products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 10:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Basically, the client delegates the domain name\nresolution towards the QuicSocks proxy. Our results indicate, that colocating\nour proxy with real-world ISP-provided DNS resolvers provides great performance\ngains. For example, 10% of our 474 sample nodes distributed across ISP's in\nGermany would save at least 30ms per QUIC connection establishment.

While providing service endpoints close to the\nend user appears straightforward, this early service break-out is currently\nlimited to routing requests to Point-of-Presence (POP) nodes provided by a few\nglobal CDN players deep in the customer network.

Despite\nsignificant advances have been made, most of the change detection methods fail\nto work well in challenging scenes due to ubiquitous noise and interferences.\nNowadays, post-processing methods (e.g. MRF, and CRF) aiming to enhance the\nbinary change detection results still fall short of the requirements on\nuniversality for distinctive scenes, applicability for different types of\ndetection methods, accuracy, and real-time performance. Inspired by the nature\nof image filtering, which separates noise from pixel observations and recovers\nthe real structure of patches, we consider utilizing image filters to enhance\nthe detection masks. In this paper, we present an integrated filter which\ncomprises a weighted local guided image filter and a weighted spatiotemporal\ntree filter. The spatiotemporal tree filter leverages the global spatiotemporal\ninformation of adjacent video frames and meanwhile the guided filter carries\nout local window filtering of pixels, for enhancing the coarse change detection\nmasks. The main contributions are three: (i) the proposed filter can make full\nuse of the information of the same object in consecutive frames to improve its\ncurrent detection mask by computations on a spatiotemporal minimum spanning\ntree; (ii) the integrated filter possesses both advantages of local filtering\nand global filtering; it not only has good edge-preserving property but also\ncan handle heavily textured and colorful foreground regions; and (iii) Unlike\nsome popular enhancement methods (MRF, and CRF) that require either a priori\nbackground probabilities or a posteriori foreground probabilities for every\npixel to improve the coarse detection masks, our method is a versatile\nenhancement filter that can be applied after many different types of change\ndetection methods, and is particularly suitable for video sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 11:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

But while\nthe macroscale friction behavior of ice and snow has been widely investigated,\nvery little is known about the interfacial water film and its mechanical\nproperties. In this work, we develop a stroke-probe force measurement technique\nto uncover the microscopic mechanisms underlying ice lubrication. We\nsimultaneously measure the shear friction of a bead on ice and quantify the\nin-situ mechanical properties of the interfacial film, as well as its\nthickness, under various regimes of speed and temperature. In contrast with\nstandard views, meltwater is found to exhibit a complex visco-elastic rheology,\nwith a viscosity up to two orders of magnitude larger than pristine water. The\nnon-conventional rheology of meltwater provides a new, consistent, rationale\nfor ice slipperiness. Hydrophobic coatings are furthermore shown to strongly\nreduce friction due to a surprising change in the local viscosity, providing an\nunexpected explanation for waxing effects in winter sports.

Accurately modeling the void microstructure is\ncritical to theoretically understanding the cause of these issues. Previous\nmethods of modeling voids have involved removing atoms according to an {\\it a\npriori} idea of void structure and/or using computationally expensive molecular\ndynamics. We propose a new fast and unbiased approach based on the established\nand efficient Wooten-Winer-Weaire (WWW) Monte Carlo method, by using a range of\nfixed densities to generate equilibrium structures of $a$-Si and $a$-Si:H that\nmaintain 4-coordination.

However, these techniques suffer either from being\nrestricted to a particular task, such as visual adaptation, require a lot of\ncomputational time and data, which is not always guaranteed, have complex\nparameterization, or expensive optimization procedures. In this work, we\npresent an approach that requires only a well-chosen snapshot of data to find a\nsingle domain invariant subspace. The subspace is calculated in closed form and\noverrides domain structures, which makes it fast and stable in\nparameterization. By employing low-rank techniques, we emphasize on descriptive\ncharacteristics of data. The presented idea is evaluated on various domain\nadaptation tasks such as text and image classification against state of the art\ndomain adaptation approaches and achieves remarkable performance across all\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 13:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 10:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 12:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

While this exploits the geometry of the heart, it is of\nlimited expressiveness to allow partitioning that is small enough for effective\noptimization. Recently, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) was utilized as a more\nexpressive generative model to embed the HD optimization into the LD latent\nspace.

The question of\nwhy no oscillations were detected in the remaining stars is still open.\nPrevious works explained the non-detection of modes with the high level of\nmagnetic activity. However, the studied stars contained some classical\npulsators and red giants that could have biased the results. In this work, we\nrevisit this analysis on a cleaner sample of 1,014 main-sequence solar-like\nstars. First we compute the predicted amplitude of the modes. We find that the\nstars with detected modes have an amplitude to noise ratio larger than 0.94.

We find that among these 323 stars\n32% have a magnetic activity level larger than the Sun at maximum activity,\nexplaining the non-detection of p modes. Interestingly, magnetic activity\ncannot be the primary reason responsible for the absence of detectable modes in\nthe remaining 68% of the stars without p modes detected and with reliable\nrotation periods. Thus, we investigate metallicity, inclination angle, and\nbinarity as possible causes of low mode amplitudes. Using spectroscopic\nobservations for a subsample, we find that a low metallicity could be the\nreason for suppressed modes. No clear correlation with binarity nor inclination\nis found. We also derive the lower limit for our photometric activity index (of\n20-30 ppm) below which rotation and magnetic activity are not detected. Finally\nwith our analysis we conclude that stars with a photometric activity index\nlarger than 2,000 ppm have 98.3% probability of not having oscillations\ndetected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 14:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

We demonstrate that this\nflux-mediated coupling can be tuned in-situ by the magnetic flux in the SQUID,\nenabling nanosecond flux tuning of the optomechanical coupling. Tuning the\nexternal in-plane magnetic transduction field, we observe a linear scaling of\nthe single-photon coupling strength, reaching rates comparable to the current\nstate-of-the-art. Finally, this linear scaling is predicted to overcome the\nlimits of single-photon coupling rates in capacitive optomechanics, opening the\ndoor for a new generation of groundbreaking optomechanical experiments in the\nsingle-photon strong coupling regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 14:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This effect\ncreates a hot spot behind and a cold spot in front of moving massive objects.\nThe dipole signal created by the slingshot effect can be used to measure\ntransverse velocities, but because the signal is expected to be weak, the\neffect has not been measured yet. The aim is to show that the slingshot effect\ncan be measured by stacking the signals of galaxies falling into a collapsing\ncluster. We evaluate if the effect can probe modified gravity. We use data from\na simulated galaxy catalogue (MDPL2) to mimic observations. We identify a\nmassive galaxy cluster, and make maps of the slingshot effect around infalling\ngalaxies.

The workshop explored in depth the\nlatest developments on the determination of the QCD coupling $\\alpha_s$ from\nthe key categories where high precision measurements are available: (i) lattice\nQCD, (ii) hadronic $\\tau$ decays, (iii) deep-inelastic scattering and parton\ndistribution functions, (iv) event shapes, jet cross sections, and other\nhadronic final-states in $e^+e^-$ collisions, (v) Z boson and W boson hadronic\ndecays, and (vi) hadronic final states in p-p collisions. The status of the\ncurrent theoretical and experimental uncertainties associated to each\nextraction method, and future perspectives were thoroughly reviewed. Novel\n$\\alpha_s$ determination approaches were discussed, as well as the combination\nmethod used to obtain a world-average value of the QCD coupling at the Z mass\npole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 15:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

A\ncentral challenge in operationalizing their approach is the difficulty in\neliciting a human specification of a similarity metric. In this paper, we\npropose an operationalization of individual fairness that does not rely on a\nhuman specification of a distance metric. Instead, we propose novel approaches\nto elicit and leverage side-information on equally deserving individuals to\ncounter subordination between social groups. We model this knowledge as a\nfairness graph, and learn a unified Pairwise Fair Representation (PFR) of the\ndata that captures both data-driven similarity between individuals and the\npairwise side-information in fairness graph. We elicit fairness judgments from\na variety of sources, including human judgments for two real-world datasets on\nrecidivism prediction (COMPAS) and violent neighborhood prediction (Crime &\nCommunities). Our experiments show that the PFR model for operationalizing\nindividual fairness is practically viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 15:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 03:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

The torque on the\nbinaries receives significant contributions from a wide range of scales, that\ngoes from the size of the horizon at the time when the binary forms, down to\nthe co-moving size of the binary. In scenarios where PBH are formed from\nadiabatic perturbations, it is natural to expect an enhancement of the power\nspectrum $P_\\Phi$ at small scales, where it is poorly constrained\nobservationally. The effect can then be quite significant. For instance, a\nnearly flat spectrum with amplitude $P_\\Phi \\gtrsim 10^{-7}$ on scales smaller\nthan $\\sim 10 Mpc^{-1}$ gives a contribution $\\langle j^2 \\rangle \\sim 10^3\nP_\\Phi$, where $j= (1-e^2)^{1/2}$ is the dimensionless angular momentum\nparameter of the binaries. This contribution can dominate over tidal torques\nfrom neighboring PBHs for any value of $f$. Current constraints allow for a\npower spectrum as large as $P_\\Phi \\sim 10^{-5}$ at the intermediate scales\n$10^3-10^5 Mpc^{-1}$, comparable to the co-moving size of the binaries at the\ntime of formation.

Keich and Noble (2017b) recently demonstrated some advantages\nof using multiple rather than a single decoy when addressing the problem of\nassigning peptide sequences to observed mass spectra. In this work, we consider\na related problem -- detecting peptides based on a collection of mass spectra\n-- and we develop a new framework for competition-based FDR control using\nmultiple null scores. Within this framework, we offer several methods, all of\nwhich are based on a novel procedure that rigorously controls the FDR in the\nfinite sample setting. Using real data to study the peptide detection problem\nwe show that, relative to existing single-decoy methods, our approach can\nincrease the number of discovered peptides by up to 50% at small FDR\nthresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 15:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

In the Gaussian case the noise is\nassumed to be the realization of a Gaussian random field (GRF). The most\nimportant property of the MF, the maximization of the probability of detection\nsubject to a constant probability of false detection or false alarm (PFA),\nmakes it one of the most popular techniques. However, the MF technique relies\nupon the a priori knowledge of the number and the position of the searched\nsignals in the GRF which usually are not available. A typical way out is to\nassume that the position of a signal coincides with one of the peaks in the\nmatched filtered data. A detection is claimed when the probability that a given\npeak is due only to the noise (i.e. the PFA) is smaller than a prefixed\nthreshold. In this case the probability density function (PDF) of the\namplitudes has to be used for the computation of the PFA, which is different\nfrom the Gaussian. Moreover, the probability that a detection is false depends\non the number of peaks present in the filtered GRF, the greater the number of\npeaks in a GRF, the higher the probability of peaks due to the noise that\nexceed the detection threshold. If not taken into account, the PFA can be\nseverely underestimated. Many solutions proposed to this problem are\nnon-parametric hence not able to exploit all the available information. This\nlimitation has been overcome by means of two efficient parametric approaches,\none based on the PDF of the peak amplitudes of a smooth and isotropic GRF\nwhereas the other uses the Gumbel distribution (the asymptotic PDF of the\ncorresponding extreme). Simulations and ALMA maps show that, although the two\nmethods produce almost identical results, the first is more flexible and allows\nus to check the reliability of the detection procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 15:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

One of the most important\napplications in the computer vision community is human activity recognition. In\norder to recognize human activities, we propose a human body parts tracking\nsystem that tracks human body parts such as head, torso, arms and legs in order\nto perform activity recognition tasks in real time. This thesis presents a\nreal-time human body parts tracking system (i.e. HBPT) from video sequences.\nOur body parts model is mostly represented by body components such as legs,\nhead, torso and arms. The body components are modeled using torso location and\nsize which are obtained by a torso tracking method in each frame. In order to\ntrack the torso, we are using a blob tracking module to find the approximate\nlocation and size of the torso in each frame. By tracking the torso, we will be\nable to track other body parts based on their location with respect to the\ntorso on the detected silhouette. In the proposed method for human body part\ntracking, we are also using a refining module to improve the detected\nsilhouette by refining the foreground mask (i.e. obtained by background\nsubtraction) in order to detect the body parts with respect to torso location\nand size. Having found the torso size and location, the region of each human\nbody part on the silhouette will be modeled by a 2D-Gaussian blob in each frame\nin order to show its location, size and pose.

We view this as an\nonline revenue management problem where the insurance company looks to set\nprices to optimize the long-run revenue from selling a new insurance product.\nWe develop two pricing models: an adaptive Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and\nan adaptive Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Both balance between\nexploration, where we choose prices in order to learn the distribution of\ndemands & claims for the insurance product, and exploitation, where we\nmyopically choose the best price from the information gathered so far. The\nperformance of the pricing policies is measured in terms of regret: the\nexpected revenue loss caused by not using the optimal price. As is commonplace\nin insurance, we model demand and claims by GLMs. In our adaptive GLM design,\nwe use the maximum quasi-likelihood estimation (MQLE) to estimate the unknown\nparameters. We show that, if prices are chosen with suitably decreasing\nvariability, the MQLE parameters eventually exist and converge to the correct\nvalues, which in turn implies that the sequence of chosen prices will also\nconverge to the optimal price. In the adaptive GP regression model, we sample\ndemand and claims from Gaussian Processes and then choose selling prices by the\nupper confidence bound rule. We also analyze these GLM and GP pricing\nalgorithms with delayed claims.

Many high-tech industrial firms are\nexploring different approaches to implement smart cities. Various projects aim\nat internet-of-things and smart solutions. Current implementations are mostly\nlocalized to a specific building or area; however, the growth is crossing space\nand geographic location limits. Shopping is a central activity that is frequent\nand typically a time-consuming task. SysMART is system of connected and smart\nsupermarkets. SysMART enables a plausible shopping experience for customers.\nThe aim of SysMART is to provide an advanced lifestyle with its ease of use\nfunctionality. SysMART outdoor services support distant parking availability,\ntraffic status, and remote inventory checks for supermarkets in a chain.\nSysMART implementation relies on cutting edge technologies that support rapid\nprototyping and precision data acquisition, such as, National Instrument\ndevices. The selected development environment is LabView with its world-class\ninterfacing libraries. The paper comprises a detailed system description,\ndevelopment strategy, interface design, software engineering, and a thorough\nanalysis and evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 17:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}
