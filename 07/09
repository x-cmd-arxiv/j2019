If\nangular momentum (AM) transport between the core and the envelope is\ninefficient, the large core AM upon core-collapse will produce rapidly rotating\nneutron stars (NSs). However, observations of low-mass stars suggest an\nefficient AM transport mechanism is at work, which could drastically reduce NS\nspin rates. Here we study the effects of the baroclinic instability and the\nmagnetic Tayler instability in differentially rotating radiative zones.\nAlthough the baroclinic instability may occur, the Tayler instability is likely\nto be more effective for AM transport. We implement Tayler torques as\nprescribed by Fuller et al. 2019 into models of massive stars, finding they\nremove the vast majority of the core's AM as it contracts between the main\nsequence and helium-burning phases of evolution. If core AM is conserved during\ncore-collapse, we predict natal NS rotation periods of $P_{\\rm NS} \\approx\n50-200 \\, {\\rm ms}$, suggesting these torques help explain the relatively slow\nrotation rates of most young NSs, and the rarity of rapidly rotating\nengine-driven supernovae. Stochastic spin-up via waves just before\ncore-collapse, asymmetric explosions, and various binary evolution scenarios\nmay increase the initial rotation rates of many NSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 16:36:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 06:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

A major uncertainty in stellar theory is the angular momentum (AM)\ntransport within the star that determines its core rotation rate and the\nresulting BH's spin. Internal rotation rates of low-mass stars measured from\nasteroseismology prove that AM transport is efficient, suggesting that massive\nstellar cores may rotate slower than prior expectations. We investigate AM\ntransport via the magnetic Tayler instability, which can largely explain the\nrotation rates of low-mass stars and white dwarfs. Implementing an updated AM\ntransport prescription into models of high-mass stars, we compute the spins of\ntheir BH remnants. We predict that BHs born from single stars rotate very\nslowly, with $a \\sim 10^{-2}$, regardless of initial rotation rate, possibly\nexplaining the low $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ of most BH binaries detected by LIGO thus\nfar.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the dependence of this core-powered mass-loss mechanism on stellar\nmass ($M_\\ast$), metallicity ($Z_\\ast$) and age ($\\tau_\\ast$). Without making\nany changes to the underlying planet population, we find that the core-powered\nmass-loss model yields a shift in the radius valley to larger planet sizes\naround more massive stars with a slope given by $\\text{d log}R_p/\\text{d\nlog}M_\\ast \\simeq 0.35$, in agreement with observations. To first order, this\nslope is driven by the dependence of core-powered mass-loss on the bolometric\nluminosity of the host star and is given by $\\text{d log}R_p/\\text{d log}M_\\ast\n\\simeq (3\\alpha-2)/36 \\simeq 0.33$, where $(L_\\ast/L_\\odot) =\n(M_\\ast/M_\\odot)^\\alpha$ is the stellar mass-luminosity relation and\n$\\alpha\\simeq 4.6$ for the CKS dataset. We therefore find, in contrast to\nphotoevaporation models, no evidence for a linear correlation between planet\nand stellar mass, but can't rule it out either. In addition, we show that the\nlocation of the radius valley is, to first order, independent of stellar age\nand metallicity. Since core-powered mass-loss proceeds over Gyr timescales, the\nabundance of super-Earths relative to sub-Neptunes increases with age but\ndecreases with stellar metallicity.

Existing DTA techniques use\nrule-based taint-propagation, which is neither accurate (i.e., high false\npositive) nor efficient (i.e., large runtime overhead). It is hard to specify\ntaint rules for each operation while covering all corner cases correctly.\nMoreover, the overtaint and undertaint errors can accumulate during the\npropagation of taint information across multiple operations.

We establish this by constructing and analyzing\ntopological field theories which describe the dynamics of field singularities\nusing gauge fields. Homotopy groups are utilized to identify topologically\nprotected singularities, and the conservation of their protected number is\ncaptured by a topological action term that unambiguously obtains from the given\nset of symmetries. Stable phases of these theories include quantum liquids with\nemergent massless Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields, as well as topological\norders with long-range quantum entanglement, fractional excitations, boundary\nmodes and unconventional responses to external perturbations. This paper\nfocuses on the derivation of topological field theories and basic\nphenomenological characterization of topological orders associated with\nhomotopy groups $\\pi_n(S^n)$, $n\\ge 1$.

The\ninsulating vapor film can be highly detrimental in metallurgical quenching and\nthermal control of electronic devices, but may also be harnessed to reduce drag\nand generate power. Manipulation of the LFP has occurred mostly through\nexperiment, giving rise to a variety of semi-empirical models that account for\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability, nucleation rates, and superheat limits.\nHowever, a truly comprehensive model has been difficult given that the LFP\nvaries dramatically for different fluids and is affected by system pressure,\nsurface roughness and liquid wettability. Here, we identify the vapor film\ninstability for small length scales that ultimately sets the collapse condition\nat the Leidenfrost point. From a linear stability analysis, it is shown that\nthe main film stabilizing mechanisms are the liquid-vapor surface tension,\nviscous transport of vapor mass, and evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface.\nMeanwhile, van der Waals interaction between the bulk liquid and the solid\nsubstrate across the vapor phase drives film collapse. This physical insight\ninto vapor film dynamics allows us to derive an ab-initio, mathematical\nexpression for the Leidenfrost point of a fluid. The expression captures the\nexperimental data on the LFP for different fluids under various surface\nwettabilities and ambient pressures. For fluids that wet the surface (small\nintrinsic contact angle), the expression can be simplified to a single,\ndimensionless number that encapsulates the thermo-wetting instability governing\nthe LFP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 18:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 19:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 03:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 20:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

One often uses numerical\nformulations to study VF with DD effects. The primary aim of the current study\nis to show that popular formulations have limitations to study VF with DD\neffect. These limitations include exhibiting node-to-node spurious\noscillations, violating physical constraints such as the non-negativity of the\nconcentration field or mathematical principles such as the maximum principle,\nand suppressing physical instabilities. We will use several popular stabilized\nfinite element formulations---the SUPG formulations and three modifications\nbased on the SOLD approach---in our study.

Since clusters are weekly\nbound objects, their production is very sensitive to the dynamical evolution of\nthe system and its interactions. The theoretical description of cluster\nformation is related to the n-body problem. Here we present the novel n-body\ndynamical transport approach PHQMD (Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics)\nwhich is designed to provide a microscopic description of nuclear cluster and\nhypernucleus formation as well as of general particle production in heavy-ion\nreactions at relativistic energies. In difference to the coalescence or\nstatistical models, often used for the cluster formation, in PHQMD clusters are\nformed dynamically due to the interactions between baryons described on a basis\nof Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD)which allows to propagate the n-body Wigner\ndensity and n-body correlations in phase-space, essential for the cluster\nformation. The clusters are identified by the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) or\nthe SACA ('Simulated Annealing Cluster Algorithm') algorithm which finds the\nmost bound configuration of nucleons and clusters. Collisions among hadrons as\nwell as Quark-Gluon-Plasma formation and parton dynamics in PHQMD are treated\nin the same way as in the established PHSD (Parton-Hadron-String\nDynamics)transport approach.

Our model of the emission from NGC 5548 corrects for\noverlying absorption and deblends the individual emission lines. Using the\nmodeled spectra, we measure the response to continuum variations for the\ndeblended and absorption-corrected individual broad emission lines, the\nvelocity-dependent profiles of Ly$\\alpha$ and C IV, and the narrow and broad\nintrinsic absorption features. We find that the time lags for the corrected\nemission lines are comparable to those for the original data. The\nvelocity-binned lag profiles of Ly$\\alpha$ and C IV have a double-peaked\nstructure indicative of a truncated Keplerian disk. The narrow absorption lines\nshow delayed response to continuum variations corresponding to recombination in\ngas with a density of $\\sim 10^5~\\rm cm^{-3}$. The high-ionization narrow\nabsorption lines decorrelate from continuum variations during the same period\nas the broad emission lines. Analyzing the response of these absorption lines\nduring this period shows that the ionizing flux is diminished in strength\nrelative to the far-ultraviolet continuum. The broad absorption lines\nassociated with the X-ray obscurer decrease in strength during this same time\ninterval. The appearance of X-ray obscuration in $\\sim\\,2012$ corresponds with\nan increase in the luminosity of NGC 5548 following an extended low state.

Studies where the effects of different material\ncompositions on transition jitter and the switching probability are evaluated\nwere done, but it is not obvious, how significant those improvements will\nfinally change the received SNR.

Different values lead to corresponding bit patterns on granular\nmedia, where a reader model detects the resulting signal, which is finally\nconverted to a parameter dependent SNR value.

In the present paper we consider a\ntype of Leonard pair, said to have spin. The notion of a spin model was\nintroduced by V.F.R. Jones to construct link invariants. A spin model is a\nsymmetric matrix over $\\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies two conditions, called the\ntype II and type III conditions. It is known that a spin model $\\sf W$ is\ncontained in a certain finite-dimensional algebra $N({\\sf W})$, called the\nNomura algebra. It often happens that a spin model $\\sf W$ satisfies ${\\sf W}\n\\in {\\sf M} \\subseteq N({\\sf W})$, where $\\sf M$ is the Bose-Mesner algebra of\na distance-regular graph $\\Gamma$; in this case we say that $\\Gamma$ affords\n$\\sf W$. If $\\Gamma$ affords a spin model, then each irreducible module for\nevery Terwilliger algebra of $\\Gamma$ takes a certain form, recently described\nby Caughman, Curtin, Nomura, and Wolff.

However, these results are limited to a single residual\nblock (i.e., shallow ResNets), instead of the deep ResNets composed of multiple\nresidual blocks. We take a step towards extending this result to deep ResNets.\nWe start by two motivating examples. First, we show that there exist datasets\nfor which all local minima of a fully-connected ReLU network are no better than\nthe best linear predictor, whereas a ResNet has strictly better local minima.\nSecond, we show that even at the global minimum, the representation obtained\nfrom the residual block outputs of a 2-block ResNet do not necessarily improve\nmonotonically over subsequent blocks, which highlights a fundamental difficulty\nin analyzing deep ResNets. Our main theorem on deep ResNets shows under simple\ngeometric conditions that, any critical point in the optimization landscape is\neither (i) at least as good as the best linear predictor; or (ii) the Hessian\nat this critical point has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Notably, our theorem\nshows that a chain of multiple skip-connections can improve the optimization\nlandscape, whereas existing results study direct skip-connections to the last\nhidden layer or output layer. Finally, we complement our results by showing\nbenign properties of the \"near-identity regions\" of deep ResNets, showing\ndepth-independent upper bounds for the risk attained at critical points as well\nas the Rademacher complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 00:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 05:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Therefore, it is crucial\nto bridge composition--structure and structure--property relationships.

We made NIR JHKS bands\npolarimetric observations of the comet for 12 days near perihelion,\ninterspersed between broadband optical imaging observations over four months.\nIn addition, dynamical simulation of the comet was performed 1000 yr backward\nin time. Results. We detected two discontinuous brightness enhancements. Before\nthe first enhancement, the NIR polarization degrees were far lower than those\nof ordinary comets at a given phase angle. Soon after the activation, however,\nthey increased by ~13 % at most, showing unusual blue polarimetric color over\nthe J and H bands (-2.55 % / um on average) and bluing of both J-H and H-Ks\ndust color.

The\nmarked increase in the polarization degree with blue NIR polarimetric color is\nreminiscent of the behaviors of a fragmenting comet D/1999 S4 (LINEAR). The\nmost plausible scenario for the observed polarimetric properties of 252P/LINEAR\nwould be an ejection of predominantly large, compact dust particles from the\ndesiccated surface layer.

We propose a first ideal formulation with $\\ell_0$-norm\nto minimize the cardinal of non-zero angular articulation motion given an\nequality constraint on the time-differentiation of the reprojection error. The\nsecond relaxed formulation relies on an $\\ell_1$-norm to minimize the sum of\nabsolute values of the angular articulation motion.

Although less common for solid materials, it was shown\ntheoretically to be possible for covalent interactions at the chemically-active\nelectronic shell (or valence-band maximum) of semiconductors to reverse their\nmore common nature and become repulsive, i.e., act against bonding.

Building on this theory, we introduce\nDisturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based imitation\nlearning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral\ncloning to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked\ndemonstrations are used to efficiently learn a reward function that can then be\noptimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically validate our approach on\nsimulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that D-REX\noutperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly\nsurpass the performance of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation\nlearning approach to achieve significant extrapolation beyond the\ndemonstrator's performance without additional side-information or supervision,\nsuch as rewards or human preferences. By generating rankings automatically, we\nshow that preference-based inverse reinforcement learning can be applied in\ntraditional imitation learning settings where only unlabeled demonstrations are\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 04:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 01:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 17:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

The peculiar coupling between spin\nand polar degrees of freedom responsible for several exceptional properties,\nincluding ferroelectric switching of Rashba spin texture, suggests that the\nelectron's spin could be controlled by using only electric fields. In this\nregard, recent experimental studies revealing charge-to-spin interconversion\nphenomena in two prototypical FERSC, GeTe and SnTe, appear extremely relevant.\nHere, by employing density functional theory calculations, we investigate spin\nHall effect (SHE) in these materials and show that it can be large either in\nferroelectric or paraelectric structure. We further explore the compatibility\nbetween doping required for the practical realization of SHE in semiconductors\nand polar distortions which determine Rashba-related phenomena in FERSC, but\nwhich could be suppressed by free charge carriers. Based on the analysis of the\nlone pairs which drive ferroelectricity in these materials, we have found that\nthe polar displacements in GeTe can be sustained up to a critical hole\nconcentration of over $\\sim 10^{21}$/cm$^{3}$, while the tiny distortions in\nSnTe vanish at a minimal level of doping. Finally, we have estimated spin Hall\nangles for doped structures and demonstrated that the spin Hall effect could be\nindeed achieved in a polar phase. We believe that the confirmation of spin Hall\neffect, Rashba spin textures and ferroelectricity coexisting in one material\nwill be helpful for design of novel multifunctional spintronics devices\noperating without magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 04:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

However, existing approaches only work when the target is close to\nthe WiFi transceivers and the performance degrades significantly when the\ntarget is far away. On the other hand, most home environments only have one\nWiFi access point and it may not be located in the same room as the target.\nThis sensing range constraint greatly limits the application of the proposed\napproaches in real life.\n  This paper presents FarSense--the first real-time system that can reliably\nmonitor human respiration when the target is far away from the WiFi transceiver\npair. FarSense works well even when one of the transceivers is located in\nanother room, moving a big step towards real-life deployment. We propose two\nnovel schemes to achieve this goal: (1) Instead of applying the raw CSI\nreadings of individual antenna for sensing, we employ the ratio of CSI readings\nfrom two antennas, whose noise is mostly canceled out by the division operation\nto significantly increase the sensing range; (2) The division operation further\nenables us to utilize the phase information which is not usable with one single\nantenna for sensing. The orthogonal amplitude and phase are elaborately\ncombined to address the \"blind spots\" issue and further increase the sensing\nrange. Extensive experiments show that FarSense is able to accurately monitor\nhuman respiration even when the target is 8 meters away from the transceiver\npair, increasing the sensing range by more than 100%. We believe this is the\nfirst system to enable through-wall respiration sensing with commodity WiFi\ndevices and the proposed method could also benefit other sensing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 05:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 02:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 05:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

The flow can\nbe decomposed into the element-coherent, dispersive flow, the\nKelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers typically reported over dense canopies, and the\nbackground, incoherent turbulence. The canopies studied have spacings $s^+ =\n3$--$50$, which essentially preclude the background turbulence from penetrating\nwithin. The dispersive velocity fluctuations are also mainly determined by the\nspacing, and are small deep within the canopy, where the footprint of the\nKelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers dominates. Their typical streamwise wavelength\nis determined by the mixing length, which is essentially the sum of its height\nabove and below the canopy tips. For the present dense canopies, the former\nremains roughly the same in wall-units, and the latter, which scales with the\ndrag length, depends linearly on the spacing. This is the result of the drag\nbeing essentially viscous and governed by the planar layout of the canopy. In\nshallow canopies, the proximity of the canopy floor inhibits the formation of\nKelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers, with essentially no signature for\nheight-to-spacing ratios $h/s \\approx 1$, and no further inhibition beyond $h/s\n\\approx 6$. Very small spacings also inhibit the rollers, due to their\nobstruction by the canopy elements. The obstruction decreases with increasing\nspacing and the signature of the instability intensifies, even if for canopies\nsparser than those studied here the instability eventually breaks down.

Based on this\nintuition, PathRank models path ranking as a regression problem, where each\npath is associated with a ranking score.\n  To enable PathRank, we first propose an effective method to generate a\ncompact set of training data: for each trajectory, we generate a small set of\ndiversified paths. Next, we propose a multi-task learning framework to solve\nthe regression problem. In particular, a spatial network embedding is proposed\nto embed each vertex to a feature vector by considering both road network\ntopology and spatial properties, such as distances and travel times. Since a\npath is represented by a sequence of vertices, which is now a sequence of\nfeature vectors after embedding, recurrent neural network is applied to model\nthe sequence. The objective function is designed to consider errors on both\nranking scores and spatial properties, making the framework a multi-task\nlearning framework. Empirical studies on a substantial trajectory data set\noffer insight into the designed properties of the proposed framework and\nindicating that it is effective and practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 07:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Methods. We analyzed the simultaneous\noptical and X-ray variability in stars without inner disks (e.g., class III\nobjects and stars with transition disks) in NGC 2264 from observations obtained\nwith Chandra/ACIS-I and CoRoT as part of the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation\nof NGC 2264.

We then studied how this\nclassification is related with stellar properties. Results. Starting from a\nsample of 74 class III/transition disk (TD) stars observed with CoRoT and\ndetected with Chandra with more than 60 counts, we selected 16 stars whose\noptical and X-ray variability is anti-correlated, 11 correlated, and 17 where\nthere is no correlation.

Therefore, we\nintroduce a dual-attention mechanism to the 3D contextual lesion detection\nframework, including the cross-slice contextual attention to selectively\naggregate the information from different slices through a soft re-sampling\nprocess.

The use of a chemically transferable coarse-grained\nmodel enables different molecular fragments to map to the same bead type, while\nalso reducing computational expense. These properties further increase\nscreening efficiency, as many compounds are screened through the use of a\nsingle coarse-grained simulation, effectively reducing the size of chemical\ncompound space. Here, we propose new criteria for the rational design of\ncoarse-grained models that allows for the optimization of their chemical\ntransferability and evaluate the Martini model within this framework. We\nfurther investigate the scope of this chemical transferability by\nparameterizing three Martini-like models, in which the number of bead types\nranges from five to sixteen for the different force fields. We then implement a\nBayesian approach to determining which chemical groups are more likely to be\npresent on fragments corresponding to specific bead types for each model. We\ndemonstrate that a level of performance and accuracy comparable to Martini can\nbe obtained by using a force field with fewer bead types. However, the\nadvantage of including more bead types is a reduction of uncertainty with\nrespect to back-mapping these bead types to specific chemistries. Just as\nreducing the size of the coarse-grained particles leads to a finer mapping of\nconformational space, increasing the number of bead types yields a finer\nmapping of chemical compound space. Finally, we note that, due to the\nrelatively large size of the chemical fragments that map to a single martini\nbead, a clear resolution limit arises when using the water/octanol partition\nfree energy as the only descriptor when coarse-graining chemical compound\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 11:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Due to the Gibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon, the numerical\napproximation will be polluted by spurious oscillations, which produce\nunphysical numerical solutions and might finally blow up the computation. In\nthis work, we propose a new shock capturing procedure to stabilise high-order\nspectral element approximations. The procedure consists of going over from the\noriginal (polluted) approximation to a convex combination of the original\napproximation and its Bernstein reconstruction, yielding a stabilised\napproximation. The coefficient in the convex combination, and therefore the\nprocedure, is steered by a discontinuity sensor and is only activated in\ntroubled elements. Building up on classical Bernstein operators, we are thus\nable to prove that the resulting Bernstein procedure is total variation\ndiminishing and preserves monotone (shock) profiles. Further, the procedure can\nbe modified to not just preserve but also to enforce certain bounds for the\nsolution, such as positivity. In contrast to other shock capturing methods,\ne.g. artificial viscosity methods, the new procedure does not reduce the time\nstep or CFL condition and can be easily and efficiently implemented into any\nexisting code. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed shock-capturing\nprocedure is able to stabilise and enhance spectral element approximations in\nthe presence of shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 12:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

Using empirical spatiotemporal trends, several mobility models\nhave been proposed to explain the observed regularities in human movement. With\nthe advent of the World Wide Web, a new type of virtual mobility has emerged\nthat has begun to supplant many traditional facets of human activity. Here we\nconduct a systematic analysis of physical and virtual movement, uncovering both\nsimilarities and differences in their statistical patterns. The differences\nmanifest themselves primarily in the temporal regime, as a signature of the\nspatial and economic constraints inherent in physical movement, features that\nare predominantly absent in the virtual space.

While the construction gives an infinite dimensional class of\nexamples, and has been extended to polynomial automorphisms of $\\mathbb C^4$ by\nHahn and the last author, the currently known wandering domains are essentially\nunique.\n  Our goal in this paper is to construct a second example, arising from similar\ntechniques, but with distinctly different dynamical behavior. Instead of\nwandering domains arising from a Lavaurs map with an attracting fixed point, we\nconstruct a domain arising from a Lavaurs map with a fixed point of Siegel\ntype.\n  Siegel disks are not robust under perturbations, as opposed to attracting\nfixed points. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence\nof a so-called trapping domain for non-autonomous dynamical systems given by\nsequences of maps converging parabolically towards a Siegel type limit map.\n  Guaranteeing that this condition is satisfied in our current construction\nrequires a reconsideration of the proof of the original wandering domain, as\nmore precise estimates on the rate of convergence towards the Lavaurs map are\nrequired. By adapting ideas introduced recently by Bedford, Smillie and Ueda,\nand by proving the existence of parabolic curves, with control on their domains\nof definition, we prove that the convergence rate is parabolic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 13:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 21:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In this tutorial, we\nexplain in detail why the underlying outlier nature of interference often\nremains obscured, discussing the many challenges and misconceptions associated\nwith state-of-art analog and/or digital nonlinear mitigation techniques,\nespecially when addressing complex practical interference scenarios. We then\nfocus on the methodology and tools for real-time outlier noise mitigation,\ndemonstrating how the \"excess band\" observation of outlier noise enables its\nefficient in-band mitigation. We introduce the basic real-time nonlinear\ncomponents that are used for outlier noise filtering and provide examples of\ntheir implementation. We further describe complementary nonlinear filtering\narrangements for wide- and narrow-band outlier noise reduction, providing\nillustrations of their performance and the effect on channel capacity. Finally,\nwe outline \"effectively analog\" digital implementations of these filtering\nstructures, discuss their broader applications, and comment on the ongoing\ndevelopment of the platform for their demonstration and testing. To emphasize\nthe effectiveness and versatility of this approach, in our examples we use\nparticularly challenging waveforms that severely obscure low-amplitude outlier\nnoise, such as broadband chirp signals (e.g. used in radar, sonar, and\nspread-spectrum communications) and \"bursty,\" high crest factor signals (e.g.\nOFDM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 16:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Exploration (AE)\nmethod to address the domain-shift problem for re-ID in an unsupervised manner.\nSpecifically, in the target domain, the re-ID model is inducted to 1) maximize\ndistances between all person images and 2) minimize distances between similar\nperson images. In the first case, by treating each person image as an\nindividual class, a non-parametric classifier with a feature memory is\nexploited to encourage person images to move far away from each other. In the\nsecond case, according to a similarity threshold, our method adaptively selects\nneighborhoods for each person image in the feature space. By treating these\nsimilar person images as the same class, the non-parametric classifier forces\nthem to stay closer. However, a problem of the adaptive selection is that, when\nan image has too many neighborhoods, it is more likely to attract other images\nas its neighborhoods. As a result, a minority of images may select a large\nnumber of neighborhoods while a majority of images have only a few\nneighborhoods. To address this issue, we additionally integrate a balance\nstrategy into the adaptive selection. We evaluate our methods with two\nprotocols. The first one is called \"target-only re-ID\", in which only the\nunlabeled target data is used for training. The second one is called \"domain\nadaptive re-ID\", in which both the source data and the target data are used\nduring training.

Our goal is to design\nmechanisms that achieve good revenue against an ideal optimal auction that has\nfull knowledge of the distribution in advance.

Eye gaze can give a\ndirect indication of the users point of attention, which can be useful in\nimproving human-computer interaction. Gaze estimation in a non-intrusive manner\ncan make human-computer interaction more natural. Eye tracking can be used for\nseveral applications such as fatigue detection, biometric authentication,\ndisease diagnosis, activity recognition, alertness level estimation,\ngaze-contingent display, human-computer interaction, etc. Even though\neye-tracking technology has been around for many decades, it has not found much\nuse in consumer applications. The main reasons are the high cost of eye\ntracking hardware and lack of consumer level applications. In this work, we\nattempt to address these two issues. In the first part of this work,\nimage-based algorithms are developed for gaze tracking which includes a new\ntwo-stage iris center localization algorithm. We have developed a new algorithm\nwhich works in challenging conditions such as motion blur, glint, and varying\nillumination levels. A person independent gaze direction classification\nframework using a convolutional neural network is also developed which\neliminates the requirement of user-specific calibration.\n  In the second part of this work, we have developed two applications which can\nbenefit from eye tracking data. A new framework for biometric identification\nbased on eye movement parameters is developed. A framework for activity\nrecognition, using gaze data from a head-mounted eye tracker is also developed.\nThe information from gaze data, ego-motion, and visual features are integrated\nto classify the activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 15:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

If the dependence of\nthe i'th bit on the remaining n-1 bits is limited, then this is a strong\nSV-source. Even the strong SV-sources are known not to admit (universal)\ndeterministic extractors, but they have seeded extractors, as their min-entropy\nis $\\Omega(n)$. It is intuitively obvious that strong SV-sources are more than\njust high-min-entropy sources, and this work explores the intuition.\nDeterministic condensers are known not to exist for general high-min-entropy\nsources, and we construct for any constants $\\epsilon, \\delta \\in (0,1)$ a\ndeterministic condenser that maps n bits coming from a strong SV-source with\nbias at most $\\delta$ to $\\Omega(n)$ bits of min-entropy rate at least\n$1-\\epsilon$.

When rectangular windows are used,\nit is well known that this difference is related to transient effects that can\nbe estimated alongside the systems' parameters windows. In this work, we\ngeneralize the approach for arbitrary windows, showing that signal windowing\nintroduces additional terms in the system's equations. The formalism is useful\nfor frequency-domain input-output analysis of a system, and also for system\nidentification. For the latter application, the approach considerably reduces\naliasing effects and allows the computation of the associated correction terms,\nreducing the number of parameters that need to be estimated. The system\nidentification approach has features of the modulating-function technique,\nfiltering out the effects of initial conditions while retaining the spectral\ninterpretation of frequency-domain methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 13:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 13:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 08:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

An nano-network embedded within the HSF iterates over the possible MS\nconfigurations, finding the one that fully absorbs the impinging EM wave, hence\nmaximizing the energy distribution within the HSF. Using a distributed\nconsensus approach, the nano-network then matches the found configuration to\nthe most probable EM wave traits, via a static lookup table that can be created\nduring the HSF manufacturing.

TransE is the primary model among\ntranslation-based embeddings and is well-known for its low complexity and high\nefficiency. Therefore, most of the earlier works have modified the score\nfunction of the TransE approach in order to improve the performance of link\nprediction tasks. Nevertheless, proven theoretically and experimentally, the\nperformance of TransE strongly depends on the loss function. Margin Ranking\nLoss (MRL) has been one of the earlier loss functions which is widely used for\ntraining TransE. However, the scores of positive triples are not necessarily\nenforced to be sufficiently small to fulfill the translation from head to tail\nby using relation vector (original assumption of TransE). To tackle this\nproblem, several loss functions have been proposed recently by adding upper\nbounds and lower bounds to the scores of positive and negative samples.\nAlthough highly effective, previously developed models suffer from an expansion\nin search space for a selection of the hyperparameters (in particular the upper\nand lower bounds of scores) on which the performance of the translation-based\nmodels is highly dependent. In this paper, we propose a new loss function\ndubbed Adaptive Margin Loss (AML) for training translation-based embedding\nmodels. The formulation of the proposed loss function enables an adaptive and\nautomated adjustment of the margin during the learning process. Therefore,\ninstead of obtaining two values (upper bound and lower bound), only the center\nof a margin needs to be determined.

It is\nbased on a Lipschitz type extension of reward functions defined in metric\nspaces. Specifically, the McShane and Whitney extensions are considered for a\nreward function which is defined by the total evaluation of the benefits\nproduced by the investment decision at a given time. We define the metric as a\nlinear combination of a Euclidean distance and an angular metric component. All\ninformation about the evolution of the system from the beginning of the time\ninterval is used to support the extension of the reward function, but in\naddition this data set is enriched by adding some artificially produced states.\nThus, the main novelty of our method is the way we produce more states -- which\nwe call \"dreams\" -- to enrich learning. Using some known states of the\ndynamical system that represents the evolution of the financial market, we use\nour technique to simulate new states by interpolating real states and\nintroducing some random variables. These new states are used to feed a learning\nalgorithm designed to improve the investment strategy by following a typical\nreinforcement learning scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 12:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 13:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

In this paper, we propose to teach an\nall-rounder with experts in different domains. Concretely, we build a\nmulti-domain acoustic model by applying the teacher-student training framework.\nFirst, for each domain, a teacher model (domain-dependent model) is trained by\nfine-tuning a multi-condition model with domain-specific subset. Then all these\nteacher models are used to teach one single student model simultaneously. We\nperform experiments on two predefined domain setups. One is domains with\ndifferent speaking styles, the other is nearfield, far-field and far-field with\nnoise. Moreover, two types of models are examined: deep feedforward sequential\nmemory network (DFSMN) and long short term memory (LSTM). Experimental results\nshow that the model trained with this framework outperforms not only\nmulti-condition model but also domain-dependent model. Specially, our training\nmethod provides up to 10.4% relative character error rate improvement over\nbaseline model (multi-condition model).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 08:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

At training time, the method\nidentifies portions of the network such that the nodes selected from this\nsampled subgraph can effectively influence nodes in the complete network. The\nrealization of such transferable network structure based adaptable policies is\nattributed to the meticulous design of the framework that encodes relevant node\nand graph signatures driven by an appropriate reward scheme.
