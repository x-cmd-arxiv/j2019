In this paper, we\npropose a solution to these clustering problems by extending threshold\nclustering (TC) to problems of instance selection. TC is a recently developed\nclustering algorithm designed to partition data into many small clusters in\nlinearithmic time (on average). Our proposed clustering method is as follows.\nFirst, TC is performed and clusters are reduced into single \"prototype\" points.\nThen, TC is applied repeatedly on these prototype points until sufficient data\nreduction has been obtained. Finally, a more sophisticated clustering algorithm\nis applied to the reduced prototype points, thereby obtaining a clustering on\nall $n$ data points. This entire procedure for clustering is called iterative\nhybridized threshold clustering (IHTC). Through simulation results and by\napplying our methodology on several real datasets, we show that IHTC combined\nwith $k$-means or HAC substantially reduces the run time and memory usage of\nthe original clustering algorithms while still preserving their performance.\nAdditionally, IHTC helps prevent singular data points from being overfit by\nclustering algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 16:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

These\ninductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned\nhyper-parameters. In general, there is a trade-off between generality and\nperformance when algorithms use such biases. Stronger biases can lead to faster\nlearning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms.\nThis trade-off is important because inductive biases are not free; substantial\neffort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune\nhyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several\ndomain-specific components that bias the objective and the environmental\ninterface of common deep reinforcement learning agents. We investigated whether\nthe performance deteriorates when these components are replaced with adaptive\nsolutions from the literature. In our experiments, performance sometimes\ndecreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to\ncomponents crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components\nperformed better. We investigated the main benefit of having fewer\ndomain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two\nsystems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional\ntuning of either system. As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components\nperformed better on many of the new tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 16:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

In this paper we focus on the behavior and\nperformance of the methods when evaluated in the context of broad\nimplementation differences. Acknowledging the short testing interval available\nand the small number of methods available, we do find that forecast\nperformance: 1) appears to improve by including persistence or prior flare\nactivity, region evolution, and a human \"forecaster in the loop\"; 2) is hurt by\nrestricting data to disk-center observations; 3) may benefit from long-term\nstatistics, but mostly when then combined with modern data sources and\nstatistical approaches.

In\nthe next decades, these advantages are expected to be further amplified by\nAutomated MoD (AMoD), in which drivers will be replaced by automated vehicles,\nwith a big gain in terms of cost-efficiency. MoD is usually intended as a\ndoor-to-door service. However, there has been recent interest toward\nconsolidating, e.g., aggregating, the travel demand by limiting the number of\nadmitted stop locations. This implies users have to walk from/to their intended\norigin/destination.\n  The contribution of this paper is a systematic study the impact of\nconsolidation on the operator cost and on user QoS. We introduce a MoD system\nwhere pick-ups and drop-offs can only occur in a limited subset of admitted\nstop locations. The density of such locations is a system parameter: the less\nthe density, the more the user demand is consolidated. We show that, by\ndecreasing stop density, we can increase system capacity (number of passengers\nwe are able to serve). On the contrary, increasing it, we can improve QoS. The\nsystem is tested in AMoDSim, an open-source simulator. The code to reproduce\nthe results presented here is available on-line.\n  This work is a first step toward flexible mobility services that are able to\nautonomously re-configure themselves, favoring capacity or QoS, depending on\nthe amount of travel demand coming from users. In other words, the services we\nenvisage in this work shift their operational mode to any intermediate point in\nthe range from a taxi-like door-to-door service to a bus-like service, with few\nserved stops and more passengers on-board.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 16:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 08:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

We propose a novel pipeline to detect\nretinal vessels in FA images using deep neural networks that reduces the effort\nrequired for generating labeled ground truth data by combining two key\ncomponents: cross-modality transfer and human-in-the-loop learning. The\ncross-modality transfer exploits concurrently captured CF and fundus FA images.\nBinary vessels maps are first detected from CF images with a pre-trained neural\nnetwork and then are geometrically registered with and transferred to FA images\nvia robust parametric chamfer alignment to a preliminary FA vessel detection\nobtained with an unsupervised technique. Using the transferred vessels as\ninitial ground truth labels for deep learning, the human-in-the-loop approach\nprogressively improves the quality of the ground truth labeling by iterating\nbetween deep-learning and labeling. The approach significantly reduces manual\nlabeling effort while increasing engagement. We highlight several important\nconsiderations for the proposed methodology and validate the performance on\nthree datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline\nsignificantly reduces the annotation effort and the resulting deep learning\nmethods outperform prior existing FA vessel detection methods by a significant\nmargin.

The perturbation is dealt with by introducing a Rayleigh's dissipation\nfunction in the framework of variational principle that results in a set of\ncoupled ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of individual\nsoliton parameters. We further derive closed-form expressions for quick\nestimation of the temporal trajectory, drift velocity and the phase shift\naccumulated by the CS due to the externally modulated pump. We also extend the\nvariational approach to solve two solitons interaction problem in the absence\nas well as in the presence of the externally modulated field.

However, type-safe embeddings of extensible and composable\nevent patterns into statically-typed general-purpose programming languages have\nnot been systematically explored so far. Event correlation technology has often\nadopted well-known and intuitive notations from database queries, for which\napproaches to type-safe embedding do exist. However, we argue in the paper that\nthese approaches, which are essentially descendants of the work on monadic\ncomprehensions, are not well-suited for event correlations and, thus, cannot\nwithout further ado be reused/re-purposed for embedding event patterns. To\nclose this gap we propose PolyJoin, a novel approach to type-safe embedding for\nfully polyvariadic event patterns with polymorphic correlation semantics. Our\napproach is based on a tagless final encoding with uncurried higher-order\nabstract syntax (HOAS) representation of event patterns with n variables, for\narbitrary $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Thus, our embedding is defined in terms of the\nhost language without code generation and exploits the host language type\nsystem to model and type check the type system of the pattern language. Hence,\nby construction it impossible to define ill-typed patterns. We show that it is\npossible to have a purely library-level embedding of event patterns, in the\nfamiliar join query notation, which is not restricted to monads.

Particular emphasis is given to dynamics at infinite temperature, where\ncurrent autocorrelations and spatio-temporal correlation functions are obtained\nby means of an efficient pure-state approach based on the concept of\ntypicality. Our comprehensive numerical analysis unveils that high-temperature\nspin transport is diffusive in the easy-axis regime for strong exchange\nanisotropies. This finding is based on the combination of numerous signatures,\nsuch as (i) Gaussian spreading of correlations, (ii) a time-independent\ndiffusion coefficient, (iii) power-law decay of equal-site correlations, (iv)\nexponentially decaying long-wavelength modes, and (v) Lorentzian line shapes of\nthe dynamical structure factor. Moreover, we provide evidence that some of\nthese signatures are not exclusively restricted to the infinite-temperature\nlimit, but can persist at lower temperatures as well, where we complement our\nresults by additional quantum Monte Carlo simulations of large systems. In\ncontrast to the easy-axis regime, we show that in the case of an isotropic\nchain, the signatures (i) - (v) are much less pronounced or even entirely\nabsent, suggesting the existence of anomalous spin transport despite the\nnonintegrability of the model. Eventually, upon introducing a random on-site\nmagnetic field, we observe a breakdown of diffusion and distinctly slower\ndynamics. In particular, our results exhibit qualitative similarities to\ndisordered spin-1/2 chains and might be consistent with the onset of many-body\nlocalization in the S = 1 model for sufficiently strong disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 19:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 15:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

If the mass is\nnonetheless sufficiently small, such an effect is usually treated\nperturbatively and is known as the gravitational self-force due to the object.\nThis issue is still an open problem in gravitational physics today, motivated\nnot only by basic foundational interest, but also by the need for its direct\napplication in gravitational-wave astronomy. In particular, the observation of\nextreme-mass-ratio inspirals by the future space-based detector LISA will rely\ncrucially on an accurate modeling of the self-force driving the orbital\nevolution and gravitational wave emission of such systems.\n  In this paper, we present a novel derivation, based on conservation laws, of\nthe basic equations of motion for this problem. They are formulated with the\nuse of a quasilocal (rather than matter) stress-energy-momentum tensor---in\nparticular, the Brown-York tensor---so as to capture gravitational effects in\nthe momentum flux of the object, including the self-force. Our formulation and\nresulting equations of motion are independent of the choice of the perturbative\ngauge. We show that, in addition to the usual gravitational self-force term,\nthey also lead to an additional \"self-pressure\" force not found in previous\nanalyses, and also that our results correctly recover known formulas under\nappropriate conditions. Our approach thus offers a fresh geometrical picture\nfrom which to understand the self-force fundamentally, and potentially useful\nnew avenues for computing it practically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 20:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

A major\nchallenge is to relate these scattering and resonance theoretical notions,\ne.g., to prove that the poles of the resolvent operator induce the above\nmentioned peaks in the scattering matrix. In the case of quantum mechanics,\nthis problem was addressed in numerous works that culminated in Simon's seminal\npaper [33] in which a general solution was presented for a large class of pair\npotentials.

These\ntidal disruption events (TDEs) are being discovered at an ever-increasing rate.\nWe present a model for the evolution of the tidally-disrupted debris from a\npartial TDE, in which a stellar core survives the initial tidal encounter and\ncontinues to exert a gravitational influence on the expanding stream of\ntidally-stripped debris. We use this model to show that the asymptotic fallback\nrate of material to the black hole in a partial TDE scales as $\\propto\nt^{-2.26\\pm0.01}$, and is effectively independent of the mass of the core that\nsurvives the encounter; we also estimate the rate at which TDEs approach this\nasymptotic scaling as a function of the core mass. These findings suggest that\nthe late-time accretion rate onto a black hole from a TDE either declines as\n$t^{-5/3}$ if the star is completely disrupted or $t^{-9/4}$ if a core is left\nbehind. We emphasize that previous investigations have not recovered this\nresult due to the assumption of a Keplerian energy-period relationship for the\ndebris orbits, which is no longer valid when a surviving core generates a\ntime-dependent, gravitational potential.

IL can be useful to kick-start learning before\napplying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g.\nto learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation\nof current IL approaches is that they learn only a single \"average\" policy\nbased on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different\ntypes of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral\nRepertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of\nbehaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs\nwith behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural\nnetwork policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely\nmodulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to\nperform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the\nhigh-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results\ndemonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express\ndistinct behaviors.

The hardware and control design aspects\nof this requirement are discussed in this paper. A battery emulation control\nscheme is proposed for the RGTI that facilitates seamless functioning of the\nRGTI in parallel with the physical UPS battery to reduce its discharge current.\nA system-level control scheme for overall operation and power management is\npresented to handle the dynamic variations in solar irradiation and UPS loads\nduring the day, such that the battery discharge burden is minimized. The design\nand operation of the proposed RGTI system are independent of the external UPS\nand can be integrated with an UPS supplied by any manufacturer. Experimental\nresults on a 4~kVA hardware setup validate the proposed RGTI concept, its\noperation and control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 05:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

The amplitude and frequency of each echo is modulated by\nthe photon-sphere barrier of the remnant, which acts as a spin- and\nfrequency-dependent high-pass filter, decreasing the frequency content of each\nsubsequent echo. Furthermore, a major fraction of the energy of the echo signal\nis contained in low-frequency resonances corresponding to the quasi-normal\nmodes of the remnant.

Fault Tolerance in Neural Networks is crucial in\nreal-time safety critical applications requiring computation for long\ndurations. Neural Networks with high regularisation exhibit superior fault\ntolerance, however, at the cost of classification accuracy. In the view of\ndifference in functionality, a Neural Network is modelled as two separate\nnetworks, i.e, the Feature Extractor with unsupervised learning objective and\nthe Classifier with a supervised learning objective. Traditional approaches of\ntraining the entire network using a single supervised learning objective is\ninsufficient to achieve the objectives of the individual components optimally.\nIn this work, a novel multi-criteria objective function, combining unsupervised\ntraining of the Feature Extractor followed by supervised tuning with Classifier\nNetwork is proposed. The unsupervised training solves two games simultaneously\nin the presence of adversary neural networks with conflicting objectives to the\nFeature Extractor. The first game minimises the loss in reconstructing the\ninput image for indistinguishability given the features from the Extractor, in\nthe presence of a generative decoder. The second game solves a minimax\nconstraint optimisation for distributional smoothening of feature space to\nmatch a prior distribution, in the presence of a Discriminator network. The\nresultant strongly regularised Feature Extractor is combined with the\nClassifier Network for supervised fine-tuning. The proposed Adversarial Fault\nTolerant Neural Network Training is scalable to large networks and is\nindependent of the architecture.

While existing methods typically need multiple rounds of\ntime-consuming AE reconstruction for better stylization, our work intends to\ndesign novel neural network architectures on top of AE for fast style transfer\nwith fewer artifacts and distortions all in one pass of end-to-end inference.\nTo this end, we propose two network architectures named ArtNet and PhotoNet to\nimprove artistic and photo-realistic stylization, respectively. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ArtNet generates images with fewer artifacts and\ndistortions against the state-of-the-art artistic transfer algorithms, while\nPhotoNet improves the photorealistic stylization results by creating sharp\nimages faithfully preserving rich details of the input content. Moreover,\nArtNet and PhotoNet can achieve 3X to 100X speed-up over the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, which is a major advantage for large content images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 11:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

But the accompanying gridding effect can cause a sparse sampling of\ninput images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this\npaper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve\nbetter trade-off between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The\ncore idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the\nresolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field.\nSpecifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and\ninverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution\n(HR) feature maps. The proposed MWCNN can also be viewed as an improvement of\ndilated filter and a generalization of average pooling, and can be applied to\nnot only image restoration tasks, but also any CNNs requiring a pooling\noperation.

Although the problem has been investigated under various settings\nreflecting typical structures within the optimization problems of practical\ninterest, little is known on how the problem behaves in conjunction with parity\nconstraints. This shortfall of understanding was rather disturbing when we\nconsider the central role of parity in the field of combinatorics. In this\npaper, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the\nfacility location problem with parity constraints. We are given as the input a\nmetric on a set of facilities and clients, the opening cost of each facility,\nand the parity requirement--odd, even, or unconstrained--of every facility in\nthis problem. The objective is to open a subset of facilities and assign every\nclient to an open facility so as to minimize the sum of the total opening costs\nand the assignment distances, but subject to the condition that the number of\nclients assigned to each open facility must have the same parity as its\nrequirement.\n  Although the unconstrained facility location problem as a relaxation for this\nparity-constrained generalization has unbounded gap, we demonstrate that it\nyields a structured solution whose parity violation can be corrected at small\ncost. This correction is prescribed by a T-join on an auxiliary graph\nconstructed by the algorithm. This graph does not satisfy the triangle\ninequality, but we show that a carefully chosen set of shortcutting operations\nleads to a cheap and sparse T-join.

It is demonstrated that various existing models can be in fact\nwritten within this framework. Ultimately, the particular structure allows for\na unified well-posedness analysis performed for different classes of linear and\nnon-linear models.

Each player, initially given two colored poker chips, is allowed to\nmake exchanges with the game coordinator according to two rules, and must\nsecure a domino before time is called in order to `survive'. Though the rules\nare simple, it is not evident by their form that the survival of the entire\ngroup requires that they cooperate at a high level. From the point of view of\nthe game coordinator, the difficulty of the game for the group can be\ncontrolled not only by the time limit, but also by the initial distribution of\nchips, in a way we make precise by a time complexity type argument. That\nanalysis also provides insight into good strategies for group survival, those\ntaking the least amount of time. In addition, coordinators may also want to be\naware of when the game is `solvable', that is, when their initial distribution\nof chips permits the survival of all group members if given sufficient time to\nmake exchanges. It turns out that the game is solvable if and only if the\ninitial distribution contains seven chips that have one of two particular color\ndistributions.

The deep convolutional neural network as the main\ncontributor to this advancement has boosted the classification accuracy\ndramatically. However, the discovery of adversarial examples reveals the\ngeneralization gap between dataset and the real world. Furthermore, affine\ntransformations may also confuse computer vision based object detectors. The\ndegradation of the perception system is undesirable for safety critical systems\nsuch as autonomous vehicles. In this paper, a deep learning system is proposed:\nAffine Disentangled GAN (ADIS-GAN), which is robust against affine\ntransformations and adversarial attacks. It is demonstrated that conventional\ndata augmentation for affine transformation and adversarial attacks are\northogonal, while ADIS-GAN can handle both attacks at the same time. Useful\ninformation such as image rotation angle and scaling factor are also generated\nin ADIS-GAN. On MNIST dataset, ADIS-GAN can achieve over 98 percent\nclassification accuracy within 30 degrees rotation, and over 90 percent\nclassification accuracy against FGSM and PGD adversarial attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 04:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

Some have viewed this\nincrease as an attempt not to expand the patients' choices but to privatize\npublic healthcare. This debate poses a social dilemma whether the NHS should\nstop cooperating with Private providers. This paper contributes to healthcare\neconomic modelling by investigating the evolution of cooperation among three\nproposed populations: Public Healthcare Providers, Private Healthcare Providers\nand Patients. The Patient population is included as a main player in the\ndecision-making process by expanding patient's choices of treatment. We develop\na generic basic model that measures the cost of healthcare provision based on\ngiven parameters, such as NHS and private healthcare providers' cost of\ninvestments in both sectors, cost of treatments and gained benefits. A\npatient's costly punishment is introduced as a mechanism to enhance cooperation\namong the three populations. Our findings show that cooperation can be improved\nwith the introduction of punishment (patient's punishment) against defecting\nproviders. Although punishment increases cooperation, it is very costly\nconsidering the small improvement in cooperation in comparison to the basic\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 15:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The triage\nprocess is critical in the appropriate allocation of resources and in\nanticipating eventual patient disposition, typically admission to the hospital\nor discharge home. EHR data are high-dimensional and complex, but offer the\nopportunity to discover and characterize underlying data-driven patient\nphenotypes. These phenotypes will enable improved, personalized therapeutic\ndecision making and prognostication. In this work, we focus on the challenge of\ntwo-dimensional patient projections. A low dimensional embedding offers visual\ninterpretability lost in higher dimensions. While linear dimensionality\nreduction techniques such as principal component analysis are often used\ntowards this aim, they are insufficient to describe the variance of patient\ndata. In this work, we employ the newly-described non-linear embedding\ntechnique called uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). UMAP\nseeks to capture both local and global structures in high-dimensional data. We\nthen use Gaussian mixture models to identify clusters in the embedded data and\nuse the adjusted Rand index (ARI) to establish stability in the discovery of\nthese clusters. This technique is applied to five common clinical chief\ncomplaints from a real-world ED EHR dataset, describing the emergent properties\nof discovered clusters. We observe clinically-relevant cluster attributes,\nsuggesting that visual embeddings of EHR data using non-linear dimensionality\nreduction is a promising approach to reveal data-driven patient phenotypes. In\nthe five chief complaints, we find between 2 and 6 clusters, with the peak mean\npairwise ARI between subsequent training iterations to range from 0.35 to 0.74.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 19:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}
