The\nparameters of the cortical model have been derived through the relation between\nthe steady state of the Wilson-Cowan model and the Divisive Normalization\nmodel.\n  The communication efficiency has been analyzed in two ways: First, we provide\nan analytical expression for the reduction of the total correlation among the\nresponses of a V1-like population after the application of the Wilson-Cowan\ninteraction. Second, we empirically study the efficiency with visual stimuli\nand statistical tools that were not available before: (1) we use a recent,\nradiometrically calibrated, set of natural scenes, and (2) we use a recent\ntechnique to estimate the multivariate total correlation in bits from sets of\nvisual responses which only involves univariate operations, thus giving better\nestimates of the redundancy.\n  The theoretical and the empirical results show that although this cascade of\nlayers was not optimized for statistical independence in any way, the\nredundancy between the responses gets substantially reduced along the neural\npathway. Specifically, we show that (1)~the efficiency of a Wilson-Cowan\nnetwork is similar to its equivalent Divisive Normalization model, (2) while\ninitial layers (Von-Kries adaptation and Weber-like brightness) contribute to\nunivariate equalization, the bigger contributions to the reduction in total\ncorrelation come from the computation of nonlinear local contrast and the\napplication of local oriented filters, and (3)~psychophysically-tuned models\nare more efficient (reduce more total correlation) in the more populated\nregions of the luminance-contrast plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

The extreme value theory peaks over\nthreshold approach is applied directly to observations of demand-net-of-wind,\nmeaning that no assumption is needed about the nature of any dependence between\ndemand and wind.\n  The methodology is tested on data from Great Britain and compared to two\nalternative approaches: use of the empirical distribution of demand-net-of-wind\nand use of a model which assumes independence between demand and wind. Extreme\nvalue theory is shown to produce broadly similar estimates of risk metrics to\nthe use of the above empirical distribution but with smaller sampling\nuncertainty. Estimates of risk metrics differ when the approach assuming\nindependence is used, especially when data across different historical years\nare pooled, suggesting that assuming independence might result in the over- or\nunder-estimation of risk metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

In this context, among several new features, we\ndiscuss the systematic bookkeeping of QCD-EW interferences, a flexible\nimplementation of the complex-mass scheme for processes with on-shell and\noff-shell unstable particles, a special treatment of on-shell and off-shell\nexternal photons, and efficient scale variations. The other main novelty is the\nimplementation of the recently proposed on-the-fly reduction algorithm, which\nsupersedes the usage of external reduction libraries for the calculation of\ntree-loop interferences. This new algorithm is equipped with an automated\nsystem that avoids Gram-determinant instabilities through analytic methods in\ncombination with a new hybrid-precision approach based on a highly targeted\nusage of quadruple precision with minimal CPU overhead. The resulting\nsignificant speed and stability improvements are especially relevant for\nchallenging NLO multi-leg calculations and for NNLO applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 23:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Unfortunately, these tasks are still\nchallenging since the appearance of samples of the same class can be more\ndifferent than those from different classes. Attention has been typically\nimplemented in neural networks by selecting the most informative regions of the\nimage that improve classification. In contrast, in this paper, attention is not\napplied at the image level but to the convolutional feature activations. In\nessence, with our approach, the neural model learns to attend to lower-level\nfeature activations without requiring part annotations and uses those\nactivations to update and rectify the output likelihood distribution. The\nproposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent and efficient in terms\nof both parameters and computation required. Experiments demonstrate that\nwell-known networks such as Wide Residual Networks and ResNeXt, when augmented\nwith our approach, systematically improve their classification accuracy and\nbecome more robust to changes in deformation and pose and to the presence of\nclutter. As a result, our proposal reaches state-of-the-art classification\naccuracies in CIFAR-10, the Adience gender recognition task, Stanford Dogs, and\nUEC-Food100 while obtaining competitive performance in ImageNet, CIFAR-100,\nCUB200 Birds, and Stanford Cars. In addition, we analyze the different\ncomponents of our model, showing that the proposed attention modules succeed in\nfinding the most discriminative regions of the image. Finally, as a proof of\nconcept, we demonstrate that with only local predictions, an augmented neural\nnetwork can successfully classify an image before reaching any fully connected\nlayer, thus reducing the computational amount up to 10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

In blazars, the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) is dominated by the non-thermal emission of the relativistic\njet, and consists of two main broad humps. For the EHBLs, these two components\npeak in the X-ray and GeV-TeV bands, respectively. Although the number of TeV\ndetected extreme blazars is very limited, recent observations by Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) have revealed that in some of them the\nenergy of the second peak exceeds several TeV (e.g. 1ES 0229+200). Their\nexceptional hard TeV spectra represent a challenge for the standard leptonic\nmodeling, and a possible hadronic contribution may make these objects\nhigh-energy neutrinos producers. Moreover, they are important for the\nimplications on the indirect measurements of the extragalactic background light\nand of the intergalactic magnetic field. In this contribution, we perform a\ncomparative study of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of a\nsample of hard X-ray selected EHBL objects.

In the mildly non-linear regime,\nsuch models typically differ from each other, and galaxy clustering data will\nbecome very precise on these scales in the near future. As the observable\nquantity is the angular power spectrum in redshift space, it is important to\nstudy the effects of non-linear density and redshift space distortion (RSD) in\nthe angular power spectrum. We compute non-linear contributions to the angular\npower spectrum using a flat-sky approximation that we introduce in this work,\nand compare the results of different perturbative approaches with $N$-body\nsimulations.

A set of $k$ blocks to be\nstored is encoded using an $[n, k]$ code to generate $n$ blocks that are then\nstored on different storage nodes. The redundancy configuration is chosen based\non the failure rates of storage devices, and is typically kept constant.\nHowever, a recent work by Kadekodi et al. shows that the failure rate of\nstorage devices vary significantly over time, and that adapting the redundancy\nconfiguration in response to such variations provides significant benefits.\nConverting the redundancy configuration of already encoded data by re-encoding\nrequires significant overhead on resources such as accesses, device IO, network\nbandwidth, and compute cycles.\n  In this work, we first present a framework to formalize the notion of code\nconversion: the process of converting data encoded with an $[n^I, k^I]$ code\ninto data encoded with an $[n^F, k^F]$ code while maintaining desired\ndecodability properties, such as the maximum-distance-separable (MDS) property.\nWe then introduce convertible codes, a new class of codes that allow for code\nconversions in a resource-efficient manner. For an important parameter regime\n(which we call the merge regime) along with the linearity and MDS decodability\nconstraint, we prove tight bounds on the number of nodes accessed during code\nconversion. In particular, our achievability result is an explicit construction\nof MDS convertible codes that are optimal for all parameter values in the merge\nregime albeit with a high field size. We then present explicit low-field-size\nconstructions of optimal MDS convertible codes for a broad range of parameters\nin the merge regime. Our results thus show that it is indeed possible to\nachieve code conversions with significantly lesser resources as compared to\nre-encoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Faint star-forming\ngalaxies are leading candidates because they are numerous and may have\nsignificant ionizing photon escape fractions ($f_{esc}$). Here we update this\npicture via an empirical model that successfully predicts latest observations\n(e.g., the drop in star-formation density at z>8). We generate an ionizing\nspectrum for each galaxy in our model and constrain $f_{esc}$ using latest\nmeasurements of the reionization timeline (e.g., Ly$\\alpha$ damping of quasars\nand galaxies at z>7). Assuming a constant $f_{esc}$, we find $M_{UV}$<-13.5\ngalaxies need $f_{esc}=0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ to complete reionization. The\ninferred IGM neutral fraction is [0.9, 0.5, 0.1] at z=[8.2, 6.8, 6.2]$\\pm$0.2,\ni.e., the bulk of reionization transpires in 300 Myrs. Inspired by the emergent\nsample of Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers that overwhelmingly displays\nhigher-than-average star-formation surface density ($\\Sigma$), we propose a\nmodel relating $f_{esc}$ to $\\Sigma$ and find\n$f_{esc}\\propto\\Sigma^{0.4\\pm0.1}$. Since $\\Sigma$ falls by ~2.5 dex between\nz=8 and z=0, our model explains the humble upper limits on $f_{esc}$ at lower\nredshifts and its required evolution to ~0.2 at z>6. Within this model,\nstrikingly, <5% of galaxies with $M_{UV}$<-18 (the `oligarchs') account for\n>80% of the reionization budget. In fact, faint sources ($M_{UV}$>-16) must be\nrelegated to a limited role to ensure high neutral fractions at z=7-8. Shallow\nfaint-end slopes of the UV luminosity function ($\\alpha$>-2) and/or $f_{esc}$\ndistributions skewed toward bright galaxies produce the required late and rapid\nreionization.

In this paper, we provide two\ndifferent prescriptions to characterize noisy stabilizer states, including the\nsurface and the color codes, in terms of localizable entanglement over a subset\nof qubits. In one approach, we exploit appropriately constructed entanglement\nwitness operators to estimate a witness-based lower bound of localizable\nentanglement, which is directly accessible in experiments. In the other recipe,\nwe use graph states that are local unitary equivalent to the stabilizer state\nto determine a computable measurement-based lower bound of localizable\nentanglement. If used experimentally, this translates to a lower bound of\nlocalizable entanglement obtained from single-qubit measurements in specific\nbases to be performed on the qubits outside the subsystem of interest. Towards\ncomputing these lower bounds, we discuss in detail the methodology of obtaining\na local unitary equivalent graph state from a stabilizer state, which includes\na new and scalable geometric recipe as well as an algebraic method that applies\nto general stabilizer states of arbitrary size. Moreover, as a crucial step of\nthe latter recipe, we develop a scalable graph-transformation algorithm that\ncreates a link between two specific nodes in a graph using a sequence of local\ncomplementation operations. We develop open-source Python packages for these\ntransformations, and illustrate the methodology by applying it to a noisy\ntopological color code, and study how the witness and measurement-based lower\nbounds of localizable entanglement varies with the distance between the chosen\nqubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 18:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 19:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Previous work showed that H2 induces\nstrong greenhouse warming at the outer edge of the habitable zone. Here we use\na 1D radiative-convective model to show that H2 also leads to strong warming\nnear the inner edge of the habitable zone. Unlike H2's greenhouse warming at\nthe outer edge, however, its effect near the inner edge is driven by\nthermodynamics: H2's large thermal scale height allows the atmosphere to store\nmore water vapor than either a pure-H2O atmosphere or an atmosphere with a\nheavy background gas, such as N2 or CO2, thereby amplifying the greenhouse\neffect of H2O. Using idealized grey calculations, we then present a general\nargument for how different background gases affect the inner edge of the\nhabitable zone. H2 stands out for its ability to induce novel \"Souffle\"\nclimates, which further support its warming effect. Our results show that if\nthe earliest conditions on a planet near the inner edge of the habitable zone\nwere H2-rich, they were likely also hot: 1 bar of H2 is sufficient to raise\nsurface temperatures above 340 K, and 50 bar of H2 are sufficient to raise\nsurface temperatures above 450 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 18:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The target domains are purposely adopted to cover\ndifferent degrees of data mismatch to the source domains. Results: Our\nexperimental results show significant performance improvement on automatic\nsleep staging on the target domains achieved with the proposed deep transfer\nlearning approach. Conclusions: These results suggest the efficacy of the\nproposed approach in addressing the above-mentioned data-variability and\ndata-inefficiency issues. Significance: As a consequence, it would enable one\nto improve the quality of automatic sleep staging models when the amount of\ndata is relatively small.

A theory and process for ABR is presented to address three\ncurrent needs: (i) designing better visualizations by making it possible for\nnon-programmers to rapidly design and critique many alternative data-to-visual\nmappings; (ii) expanding the visual vocabulary used in scientific\nvisualizations to depict increasingly complex multivariate data; (iii) bringing\na more engaging, natural, and human-relatable handcrafted aesthetic to data\nvisualization. New tools and algorithms to support ABR include front-end\napplets for constructing artifact-based colormaps, optimizing 3D scanned meshes\nfor use in data visualization, and synthesizing textures from artifacts. These\nare complemented by an interactive rendering engine with custom algorithms and\ninterfaces that demonstrate multiple new visual styles for depicting point,\nline, surface, and volume data.

However, conventional artificial\nneural networks lack the intrinsic temporal coding ability present in\nbiological networks. We propose a spiking neural network model that encodes\ninformation in the relative timing of individual neuron spikes. In\nclassification tasks, the output of the network is indicated by the first\nneuron to spike in the output layer. This temporal coding scheme allows the\nsupervised training of the network with backpropagation, using locally exact\nderivatives of the postsynaptic spike times with respect to presynaptic spike\ntimes. The network operates using a biologically-plausible alpha synaptic\ntransfer function. Additionally, we use trainable synchronisation pulses that\nprovide bias, add flexibility during training and exploit the decay part of the\nalpha function. We show that such networks can be trained successfully on noisy\nBoolean logic tasks and on the MNIST dataset encoded in time. The results show\nthat the spiking neural network outperforms comparable spiking models on MNIST\nand achieves similar quality to fully connected conventional networks with the\nsame architecture. We also find that the spiking network spontaneously\ndiscovers two operating regimes, mirroring the accuracy-speed trade-off\nobserved in human decision-making: a slow regime, where a decision is taken\nafter all hidden neurons have spiked and the accuracy is very high, and a fast\nregime, where a decision is taken very fast but the accuracy is lower. These\nresults demonstrate the computational power of spiking networks with biological\ncharacteristics that encode information in the timing of individual neurons.

In contrast to the widely used\nspatial regularisation or feature selection methods, to the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that channel selection has been advocated for\nDCF-based tracking. We demonstrate that our GFS-DCF method is able to\nsignificantly improve the performance of a DCF tracker equipped with deep\nneural network features.

By running only\nthe most trusted application components in the enclave, TEEs enable developers\nto minimize the TCB of their applications thereby helping to protect sensitive\napplication data. However, porting existing applications to TEEs often requires\nconsiderable refactoring efforts, as TEEs provide a restricted interface to\nstandard OS features. To ease development efforts, TEE application developers\noften choose to run their unmodified application in a library OS container that\nprovides a full in-enclave OS interface. Yet, this large-TCB development\napproach now leaves sensitive in-enclave data exposed to potential bugs or\nvulnerabilities in third-party code imported into the application. Importantly,\nbecause the TEE libOS and the application run in the same enclave address\nspace, even the libOS management data structures (e.g. file descriptor table)\nmay be vulnerable to attack, where in traditional OSes these data structures\nmay be protected via privilege isolation.\n  We present EnclaveDom, a privilege separation system for large-TCB TEE\napplications that partitions an enclave into tagged memory regions, and\nenforces per-region access rules at the granularity of individual in-enclave\nfunctions.

This deters the\nperformance of algorithms relying on quality landmarks, for example, face\nrecognition. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any dataset\nconsisting of low resolution face images along with their annotated landmarks,\nmaking supervised training infeasible. In this paper, we present a\nsemi-supervised approach to predict landmarks on low resolution images by\nlearning them from labeled high resolution images. The objective of this work\nis to show that predicting landmarks directly on low resolution images is more\neffective than the current practice of aligning images after rescaling or\nsuperresolution. In a two-step process, the proposed approach first learns to\ngenerate low resolution images by modeling the distribution of target low\nresolution images. In the second stage, the roles of generated images and real\nlow resolution images are switched and the model learns to predict landmarks\nfor real low resolution images from generated low resolution images. With\nextensive experimentation, we study the impact of each of the design choices\nand also show that prediction of landmarks directly on low resolution images\nimproves the performance of important tasks such as face recognition in low\nresolution images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 23:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

Data parallelism (DP) is the most widely\nused parallelization strategy, but as the number of devices in data parallel\ntraining grows, so does the communication overhead between devices.\nAdditionally, a larger aggregate batch size per step leads to statistical\nefficiency loss, i.e., a larger number of epochs are required to converge to a\ndesired accuracy. These factors affect overall training time and beyond a\ncertain number of devices, the speedup from leveraging DP begins to scale\npoorly. In addition to DP, each training step can be accelerated by exploiting\nmodel parallelism (MP). This work explores hybrid parallelization, where each\ndata parallel worker is comprised of more than one device, across which the\nmodel dataflow graph (DFG) is split using MP. We show that at scale, hybrid\ntraining will be more effective at minimizing end-to-end training time than\nexploiting DP alone.

The method\ncan be used to suppress EPI ghosts arising from the differences between\ndifferent readout gradient polarities and/or the differences between different\nshots. It does not require conventional EPI navigator signals, and is robust to\nimperfect autocalibration data.\n  Methods: Autocalibrated LORAKS is a previous structured low-rank method for\nEPI ghost correction that uses GRAPPA-type autocalibration data to enable\nhigh-quality ghost correction. This method works well when the autocalibration\ndata is pristine, but performance degrades substantially when the\nautocalibration information is imperfect. RAC-LORAKS generalizes Autocalibrated\nLORAKS in two ways. First, it does not completely trust the information from\nautocalibration data, and instead considers the autocalibration and EPI data\nsimultaneously when estimating low-rank matrix structure. And second, it uses\ncomplementary information from the autocalibration data to improve EPI\nreconstruction in a multi-contrast joint reconstruction framework. RAC-LORAKS\nis evaluated using simulations and in vivo data, including comparisons to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n  Results: RAC-LORAKS is demonstrated to have good ghost elimination\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods in several complicated EPI\nacquisition scenarios (including gradient-echo brain imaging, diffusion-encoded\nbrain imaging, and cardiac imaging).\n  Conclusion: RAC-LORAKS provides effective suppression of EPI ghosts and is\nrobust to imperfect autocalibration data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 23:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 23:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 23:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

In particular, requirements on\ntiming and energy arise in a wide variety of applications such as internet of\nthings, cloud computing, health, transportation, and robots. At the same time,\nparallel computing, with (heterogeneous) multi-core platforms in particular,\nhas become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture. Predicting resource\nusage on such platforms poses a difficult challenge. Most work on static\nresource analysis has focused on sequential programs, and relatively little\nprogress has been made on the analysis of parallel programs, or more\nspecifically on parallel logic programs. We propose a novel, general, and\nflexible framework for setting up cost equations/relations which can be\ninstantiated for performing resource usage analysis of parallel logic programs\nfor a wide range of resources, platforms and execution models. The analysis\nestimates both lower and upper bounds on the resource usage of a parallel\nprogram (without executing it) as functions on input data sizes. In addition,\nit also infers other meaningful information to better exploit and assess the\npotential and actual parallelism of a system. We develop a method for solving\ncost relations involving the max function that arise in the analysis of\nparallel programs. Finally, we instantiate our general framework for the\nanalysis of logic programs with Independent And-Parallelism, report on an\nimplementation within the CiaoPP system, and provide some experimental results.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first approach to the cost analysis of parallel\nlogic programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 01:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

While there has been\nextensive prior work on methods for outlier detection, modern datasets often\nhave sizes that are beyond the ability of commonly used methods to process the\ndata within a reasonable time. To overcome this issue, outlier detection\nmethods can be trained over samples of the full-sized dataset. However, it is\nnot clear how a model trained on a sample compares with one trained on the\nentire dataset. In this paper, we introduce the notion of resilience to\nsampling for outlier detection methods. Orthogonal to traditional performance\nmetrics such as precision/recall, resilience represents the extent to which the\noutliers detected by a method applied to samples from a sampling scheme matches\nthose when applied to the whole dataset. We propose a novel approach for\nestimating the resilience to sampling of both individual outlier methods and\ntheir ensembles. We performed an extensive experimental study on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets where we study seven diverse and representative outlier\ndetection methods, compare results obtained from samples versus those obtained\nfrom the whole datasets and evaluate the accuracy of our resilience estimates.\nWe observed that the methods are not equally resilient to a given sampling\nscheme and it is often the case that careful joint selection of both the\nsampling scheme and the outlier detection method is necessary.

Comparing to traditional\nnumerical methods, the present multiscale scheme is efficient, accurate and\nstable in all transport regimes attributed to avoiding the use of time and\nspatial steps smaller than the relaxation time and mean free path of phonons.\nThe formation, propagation and composition of ballistic pulses and second sound\nin graphene ribbon in two classical paradigms for experimental detection are\ninvestigated via the multiscale scheme. The second sound is declared to be\nmainly contributed by ZA phonon modes, whereas the ballistic pulses are mainly\ncontributed by LA and TA phonon modes. The influence of temperature, isotope\nabundance and ribbon size on the second sound propagation is also explored. The\nspeed of second sound in the observation window is found to be at most 20\npercentages smaller than the theoretical value in hydrodynamic limit due to the\nfinite umklapp, isotope and edge resistive scattering.

Without proper regularization, however, such\nreconstruction is often overwhelmed by the noise of poorly constrained modes.\nAn intuitive regularization scheme is to assume a priori the dark energy EoS to\nevolve at most slowly with time, which may be enforced by a correlation between\nthe EoS at different epochs. Indeed, studies that impose the correlation prior\nare able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of the reconstructed EoS and\neven show hints for dynamical dark energy.\n  In this work, we examine the correlation prior using mock datasets of type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs), age-derived Hubble\nparameter, Hubble constant, and cosmic microwave background. We find that even\nthough the prior is designed to disfavor evolving equations of state, it can\nstill accommodate spurious oscillating features at high significance. Within\nthe 1000 mock datasets of existing observations that are generated for the\nconcordance cosmological model, i.e., the input dark energy EoS $w=-1$, there\nare 688 (69) cases recovering an EoS that departs from $-1$ by more than\n$1\\sigma$ ($2\\sigma$) in one or more redshift bins. The reconstructed EoS turns\nup and down markedly in many cases. Moreover, inverting the signs of the\nrandomly assigned errors of the mock data more or less reverses the behavior of\nthe EoS. Spurious results occur even more frequently when idealized SN Ia and\nBAO data from future surveys are included.

To address this problem, the hybrid computing environments,\nconsisting of the cloud, edge and end devices, are adopted to offload DNN\nlayers by combining the larger layers (more amount of data) in the cloud and\nthe smaller layers (less amount of data) at the edge and end devices. A key\nissue in hybrid computing environments is how to minimize the system cost while\naccomplishing the offloaded layers with their deadline constraints. In this\npaper, a self-adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm\nusing the genetic algorithm (GA) operators was proposed to reduce the system\ncost caused by data transmission and layer execution. This approach considers\nthe characteristics of DNNs partitioning and layers offloading over the cloud,\nedge and end devices. The mutation operator and crossover operator of GA were\nadopted to avert the premature convergence of PSO, which distinctly reduces the\nsystem cost through enhanced population diversity of PSO. The proposed\noffloading strategy is compared with benchmark solutions, and the results show\nthat our strategy can effectively reduce the cost of offloading for DNN-based\napplications over the cloud, edge and end devices relative to the benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 04:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

A comparison of the particle spectra\nto that in a radial magnetic field shows that the intensity at 100 MeV (200\nMeV) is enhanced by more than one order (two orders) of magnitude.

The codes are open in GitHub\n(https://github.com/xiangzhang1015/OATM)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 08:15:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

A suitable frame sampling strategy can improve the accuracy and\nefficiency of recognition. However, mainstream solutions generally adopt\nhand-crafted frame sampling strategies for recognition. It could degrade the\nperformance, especially in untrimmed videos, due to the variation of\nframe-level saliency. To this end, we concentrate on improving untrimmed video\nclassification via developing a learning-based frame sampling strategy. We\nintuitively formulate the frame sampling procedure as multiple parallel Markov\ndecision processes, each of which aims at picking out a frame/clip by gradually\nadjusting an initial sampling.

It is pointed out that the response of 2D electrons to\nspatially-uniform potentials and fields enjoys a long-wavelength gauge\nsymmetry, associated with cyclotron motion of electrons, that leaves the\nCoulomb interaction invariant and that thus naturally explains why cyclotron\nresonance (as implied by Kohn's theorem) and the quantized Hall conductance\nappear insensitive to the interaction. It is discussed, in the light of this\nnew long-wavelength gauge symmetry, how Dirac electrons in graphene and\nconventional 2D electrons differ in cyclotron-resonance characteristics and the\nquantum Hall effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 09:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

Along the toral\ndimensions quasiperiodicity conditions are imposed with general phases and the\npresence of a constant gauge field is assumed. Different types of boundary\nconditions are discussed on the branes, including the bag boundary condition\nand the conditions arising in $Z_{2}$-symmetric braneworld models. Nonzero\nvacuum currents appear along the compact dimensions only. In the region between\nthe branes they are decomposed into the brane-free and brane-induced\ncontributions. Both these contributions are periodic functions of the magnetic\nflux enclosed by compact dimensions with the period equal to the flux quantum.\nDepending on the boundary conditions, the presence of the branes can either\nincrease or decrease the vacuum current density. For a part of boundary\nconditions, a memory effect is present in the limit when one of the branes\ntends to the AdS boundary. Unlike to the fermion condensate and the VEV of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, the VEV of the current density is finite on the branes.\nApplications are given to higher-dimensional generalizations of the\nRandall-Sundrum models with two branes and with toroidally compact subspace.\nThe features of the fermionic current are discussed in odd-dimensional parity\nand time-reversal symmetric models. The corresponding results for\nthree-dimensional spacetime are applied to finite length curved graphene tubes\nthreaded by a magnetic flux. It is shown that a nonzero current density can\nalso appear in the absence of the magnetic flux if the fields corresponding to\ntwo different points of the Brillouin zone obey different boundary conditions\non the tube edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 09:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

This study focuses on the subgroup of highly mobile researchers whom\nwe refer to as peripatetic researchers or super-movers.\n  More specifically, our aim is to track the international movements of\nresearchers who have published in more than two countries through changes in\nthe main affiliation addresses of researchers in over 62 million publications\nindexed in the Web of Science database over the 1956-2016 period.

Specifically, we propose to account for $intrinsic$\nuncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model and for $parameter$\nuncertainty through approximate Bayesian inference, and integrate the two to\nquantify $predictive$ uncertainty over the output image. Moreover, we introduce\na method to propagate the predictive uncertainty on a multi-channelled image to\nderived scalar parameters, and separately quantify the effects of intrinsic and\nparameter uncertainty therein. The methods are evaluated for super-resolution\nof two different signal representations of diffusion MR images---DTIs and Mean\nApparent Propagator MRI---and their derived quantities such as MD and FA, on\nmultiple datasets of both healthy and pathological human brains. Results\nhighlight three key benefits of uncertainty modelling for improving the safety\nof DL-based image enhancement systems. Firstly, incorporating uncertainty\nimproves the predictive performance even when test data departs from training\ndata.

Aims: Our goal is to\nmeasure the helium excess absorption from HD 209458 b and assess the extended\natmosphere of the planet and possible evaporation. Methods: We obtained new\nhigh-resolution spectral transit time-series of HD 209458 b using CARMENES at\nthe 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope, targeting the He I triplet at 10830 \\r{A} at a\nspectral resolving power of 80 400.

The propulsion\ndirection of each particle is chosen to be parallel to its dipole moment. We\nexplore a wide range of motilities and dipolar coupling strengths and\ncharacterize the corresponding behavior based on several order parameters. At\nlow densities and low motilities, the most important structural phenomenon is\nthe aggregation of the dipolar particles into chains. Upon increasing the\nparticle motility, these chain-like structures break, and the system transforms\ninto a weakly correlated isotropic fluid.

Finally, the\nfinite size effects are demonstrated to be reasonable when progressing towards\nlarger systems. Our studies indicate that experiments on small and medium\nsystems are valuable for understanding effective interactions in systems with\nvarying sizes and trap deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 13:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Macroscopic observables of complex\ndissipative chaotic systems, however, are widely assumed to have a linear\nresponse even if the microscopic variables do not, but the mechanism for this\nis not well-understood.\n  We present a comprehensive picture for the linear response of macroscopic\nobservables in high-dimensional coupled deterministic dynamical systems, where\nthe coupling is via a mean field and the microscopic subsystems may or may not\nobey linear response theory. We derive stochastic reductions of the dynamics of\nthese observables from statistics of the microscopic system, and provide\nconditions for linear response theory to hold in finite dimensional systems and\nin the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that for large systems of\nfinite size, linear response is induced via self-generated noise.\n  We present examples in the thermodynamic limit where the macroscopic\nobservable satisfies LRT, although the microscopic subsystems individually\nviolate LRT, as well a converse example where the macroscopic observable does\nnot satisfy LRT despite all microscopic subsystems satisfying LRT when\nuncoupled.

Here we show how both the vDVZ and strong coupling problems can\nbe removed by embedding 4D covariant massive gravity into a certain 5D warped\ngeometry. The 4D theory is a nonlinear strongly coupled massive gravity, that\nis being coupled to a 5D bulk theory that generates a bulk graviton mass via a\none loop diagram. This induced mass leads to an additional 4D kinetic term for\nthe 4D longitudinal mode, even on flat space. Due to this kinetic term the 4D\nmassive theory becomes weakly coupled all the way up to a high energy scale set\nby the bulk cosmological constant. The same effect leads to a suppression of\nthe interactions of the 4D longitudinal mode with a 4D matter stress-tensor,\nthus removing the vDVZ discontinuity. The proposed mechanism has a pure 4D\nholographic interpretation: a 4D nonlinear massive gravity mixes to a\nnon-conserved symmetric tensor of a 4D CFT that has a cutoff; the latter mixing\ngenerates a large kinetic term for the longitudinal mode, and this makes the\nlongitudinal mode be weakly coupled to a matter stress-tensor, and weakly\nself-coupled, all the way up to the scale of the 4D CFT cutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 13:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Contents are placed at the\nSCBSs \"free of charge\" at off-peak hours and updated during the day according\nto the content demands by considering the network usage cost. We first model\nthe caching optimization as a finite horizon Markov Decision Process that\nincorporates an auto-regressive model to forecast the evolution of the content\ndemands. The problem is NP-hard and the optimal solution can be found only for\na small number of base stations and contents. To allow derivation of close to\noptimal solutions for larger networks, we propose the rolling horizon method,\nwhich approximates future network usage cost by considering a small decision\nhorizon. The results show that the rolling horizon approach outperforms\ncomparison schemes significantly. Finally, we examine two simplifications of\nthe problem to accelerate the speed of the solution: (a) we restrict the number\nof content replicas in the network and (b) we limit the allowed content\nreplacements. The results show that the rolling horizon scheme can reduce the\ncommunication cost by over 84% compared to that of running Least Recently Used\n(LRU) updates on offline schemes. The results also shed light on the tradeoff\nbetween the efficiency of the caching policy and the time needed to run the\nonline algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel,\nhowever, has remained controversial since the first attempts to calculate it,\nwhich relied on the group delay. It is now well understood that this delay (the\narrival time of the transmitted wave packet peak at the far side of the\nbarrier) can be smaller than the barrier thickness divided by the speed of\nlight, without violating causality. There have been a number of experiments\nconfirming this, and even a recent one claiming that tunnelling may take no\ntime at all. There have also been efforts to identify another timescale, which\nwould better describe how long a given particle spends in the barrier region.\nHere we present a direct measurement of such a time, studying Bose-condensed\n$^{87}$Rb atoms tunnelling through a 1.3-${\\mu}$m thick optical barrier. By\nlocalizing a pseudo-magnetic field inside the barrier, we use the spin\nprecession of the atoms as a clock to measure the time it takes them to cross\nthe classically forbidden region.

In addition to finally shedding light\non the fundamental question of the tunnelling time, this experiment lays the\ngroundwork for addressing deep foundational questions about history in quantum\nmechanics: for instance, what can we learn about where a particle was at\nearlier times by observing where it is now?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

One important requirement is transparency, which has been\nassociated with model interpretability. Many machine learning algorithms induce\nmodels difficult to interpret, named black box. Moreover, people have\ndifficulty to trust models that cannot be explained. In particular for machine\nlearning, many groups are investigating new methods able to explain black box\nmodels. These methods usually look inside the black models to explain their\ninner work. By doing so, they allow the interpretation of the decision making\nprocess used by black box models. Among the recently proposed model\ninterpretation methods, there is a group, named local estimators, which are\ndesigned to explain how the label of particular instance is predicted. For\nsuch, they induce interpretable models on the neighborhood of the instance to\nbe explained. Local estimators have been successfully used to explain specific\npredictions. Although they provide some degree of model interpretability, it is\nstill not clear what is the best way to implement and apply them.

To answer to these questions, we propose and\ninvestigate two strategies: (i) using data instance properties to provide\nimproved explanations, and (ii) making sure that the neighborhood of an\ninstance is properly defined by taking the geometry of the domain of the\nfeature space into account.

On the other hand, EAs are also criticized for its high\ncomputational complexity, which appears to be contradictory to the core\nrequirement of real-world dynamic optimization, i.e., fast adaptation\n(typically in terms of wall-clock time) to the environmental change. So far,\nwhether EAs would indeed lead to a truly effective approach for real-world\ndynamic optimization remain unclear. In this paper, a new framework of\nemploying EAs in the context of dynamic optimization is explored.

We present\nsome properties about strong regular characteristic pairs and characteristic\ndecomposition and illustrate the proposed algorithm and its performance by\nexamples and experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 08:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

The attacks proposed so far have been\ndesigned using heuristics, and build on existing adversarial example crafting\ntechniques used to dupe classifiers in supervised learning. In contrast, this\npaper investigates the problem of devising optimal attacks, depending on a\nwell-defined attacker's objective, e.g., to minimize the main agent average\nreward. When the policy and the system dynamics, as well as rewards, are known\nto the attacker, a scenario referred to as a white-box attack, designing\noptimal attacks amounts to solving a Markov Decision Process. For what we call\nblack-box attacks, where neither the policy nor the system is known, optimal\nattacks can be trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques. Through\nnumerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our attacks compared to\nexisting attacks (usually based on Gradient methods). We further quantify the\npotential impact of attacks and establish its connection to the smoothness of\nthe policy under attack. Smooth policies are naturally less prone to attacks\n(this explains why Lipschitz policies, with respect to the state, are more\nresilient). Finally, we show that from the main agent perspective, the system\nuncertainties and the attacker can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process. We actually demonstrate that using Reinforcement Learning\ntechniques tailored to POMDP (e.g. using Recurrent Neural Networks) leads to\nmore resilient policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 15:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

In particular, we are concerned with\nmodels described by the Kingman coalescent (K), models exhibiting so-called\nweak seed banks described by a time-changed Kingman coalescent (W), models with\nso-called strong seed bank described by the seed bank coalescent (S) and the\nclassical two-island model by Wright, described by the structured coalescent\n(TI). As the presence of a (strong) seed bank should stratify a population, we\nexpect it to produce a signal roughly comparable to the presence of population\nstructure.\n  We begin with a brief analysis of Wright's $F_{ST}$, which is a classical but\ncrude measure for population structure, followed by a derivation of the\nexpected site frequency spectrum (SFS) in the infinite sites model based on\n'phase-type distribution calculus' as recently discussed by Hobolth et al.\n(2019). Both the $F_{ST}$ and the SFS can be readily computed under various\npopulation models, they discard statistical signal. Hence we also derive exact\nlikelihoods for the full sampling probabilities, which can be achieved via\nrecursions and a Monte Carlo scheme both in the infinite alleles and the\ninfinite sites model.

Computer models provide a useful tool for\nunderstanding the behavior and projecting the future of Arctic and Antarctic\nice sheets. However, these models are typically subject to large parametric\nuncertainties due to poorly constrained model input parameters that govern the\nbehavior of simulated ice sheets. Computer model calibration provides a formal\nstatistical framework to infer parameters using observational data, and to\nquantify the uncertainty in projections due to the uncertainty in these\nparameters. Calibration of ice sheet models is often challenging because the\nrelevant model output and observational data take the form of semi-continuous\nspatial data, with a point mass at zero and a right-skewed continuous\ndistribution for positive values. Current calibration approaches cannot handle\nsuch data.

While\nalternative notations using additional visual variables (such as color to\nimprove pitch identification) have been proposed, the music community does not\nreadily accept notation systems that vary widely from the CMN. Therefore, to\nsupport student musicians in understanding the harmonic relationship of notes,\ninstead of replacing the CMN, we present a visualization technique that\naugments a digital music sheet with a harmonic fingerprint glyph. Our design\nexploits the circle of fifths - a fundamental concept in music theory, as a\nvisual metaphor. By attaching these visual glyphs to each bar of a selected\ncomposition we provide additional information about the salient harmonic\nfeatures available in a musical piece. We conducted a user study to analyze the\nperformance of experts and non-experts in an identification and comparison task\nof recurring patterns. The evaluation shows that the harmonic fingerprint\nsupports these tasks without the need for close-reading, as when compared to a\nnot-annotated music sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 08:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

This means model builders\noften have to experiment with different configurations by manually programming\ndifferent architectures (which is tedious and time consuming) or rely on purely\nautomated approaches to generate and train the architectures (which is\nexpensive). In this paper, we present Rapid Exploration of Model Architectures\nand Parameters, or REMAP, a visual analytics tool that allows a model builder\nto discover a deep learning model quickly via exploration and rapid\nexperimentation of neural network architectures. In REMAP, the user explores\nthe large and complex parameter space for neural network architectures using a\ncombination of global inspection and local experimentation. Through a visual\noverview of a set of models, the user identifies interesting clusters of\narchitectures. Based on their findings, the user can run ablation and variation\nexperiments to identify the effects of adding, removing, or replacing layers in\na given architecture and generate new models accordingly. They can also\nhandcraft new models using a simple graphical interface. As a result, a model\nbuilder can build deep learning models quickly, efficiently, and without manual\nprogramming. We inform the design of REMAP through a design study with four\ndeep learning model builders. Through a use case, we demonstrate that REMAP\nallows users to discover performant neural network architectures efficiently\nusing visual exploration and user-defined semi-automated searches through the\nmodel space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 18:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

Graph-level representations are\ncritical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the\nproperties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional\ngraph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length\nrepresentations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to\nhand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language\nmodels (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures\n(e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of\nunsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method\ncalled InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the\nmutual information between the graph-level representation and the\nrepresentations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges,\ntriangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the\ndata that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we\nfurther propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semi-supervised\nscenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised\ngraph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by\nexisting supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from\nunlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the\ncurrent supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph\nclassification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is\nsuperior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 06:28:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

Also a\ntime delay as added such that when the oscillations start to grow at a new\nexcitation stage they are influenced via the delay line by the oscillations at\nthe penultimate excitation stage. Due to a nonlinearity the seeding from the\npast arrives with a doubled phase so that oscillation phase changes from stage\nto stage according to chaotic Bernoulli-type map. As a result, the system\noperates as two coupled hyperbolic chaotic subsystems. Varying the relation\nbetween the delay time and the excitation period we affect a coupling strength\nbetween these subsystems as well as intensity of the phase doubling mechanism\nresponsible for the hyperbolicity. Due to this, a transition from\nnon-hyperbolic to hyperbolic hyperchaos occurs. The following steps of the\ntransition scenario are revealed and analyzed: (a) an intermittency as\nalternation of long staying near a fixed point at the origin and short chaotic\nbursts; (b) chaotic oscillations with often visits to the fixed point; (c)\nplain hyperchaos without hyperbolicity after termination visiting the fixed\npoint; (d) transformation of hyperchaos to hyperbolic form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 09:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

This paper\ndescribes the mathematical modelling and simulation of normal mode clamped\nelliptical shaped capacitive pressure sensor. The study of various performance\nparameters like maximum diaphragm deflection, capacitance variation, mechanical\nsensitivity, capacitive sensitivity and non-linearity is also carried out for\noperating pressure range of 0 kPa to 18 kPa. For circular capacitive pressure\nsensor, the operating pressure range is modified according to physical\ndimensions i.e. thickness and radius of diaphragm, separation gap between\nplates and maximum deflection. For same overlapping area between plates\n(10000*pi mm2), the comparison of elliptical shapes of different eccentricities\nwith circular shape diaphragm is carried out. The thickness of diaphragm is\ntaken as 2 um and separation gap is 1 um in all the designs which are used in\nthis work. In this comparative study, it is observed that elliptical shaped\ncapacitive pressure sensors have better linearity than circular diaphragm\npressure sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 20:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}
