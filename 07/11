This is known to be generally impossible due to\nunidentifiability of the model. We address this issue by showing that for a\nbroad family of deep latent-variable models, identification of the true joint\ndistribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible up to very\nsimple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form of\ndisentanglement. Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the\nlatent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such\nas a class label or almost any other observation.

In some cases, the host can respond\nby producing an inhibitor of that enzyme, which can be considered as a\ncounter-counter defence. An example is provided by cephalosporins,\nbeta-lactamases and clavulanic acid (an inhibitor of beta-lactamases). Here, we\ntackle the question under which conditions it pays, during evolution, to\nestablish a counter-counter defence rather than to intensify or widen the\ndefence mechanisms. We establish a mathematical model describing this\nphenomenon, based on enzyme kinetics for competitive inhibition. We use an\nobjective function based on Haber's rule, which says that the toxic effect is\nproportional to the time integral of toxin concentration. The optimal\nallocation of defence and counter-counter defence can be calculated in an\nanalytical way despite the nonlinearity in the underlying differential\nequation. The calculation provides a threshold value for the dissociation\nconstant of the inhibitor. Only if the inhibition constant is below that\nthreshold, that is, in the case of strong binding of the inhibitor, it pays to\nhave a counter-counter defence. This theoretical prediction accounts for the\nobservation that not for all defence mechanisms, a counter-counter defence\nexists. Our results should be of interest for computing optimal mixtures of\nbeta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, as\nwell as for plant-herbivore and other molecular-ecological interactions and to\nfight antibiotic resistance in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 16:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

Often, it is possible to get a coarse estimation of\njob size, but unfortunately analytical results with inexact job sizes are\nchallenging to obtain, and simulation-based studies show that several\nsize-based algorithm are severely impacted by job estimation errors.

We propose to realize such functionality\nthrough the coupling of electrical, piezoelectric, and optomechanical\nresonators. The coupling of the mechanical subsystems enables formation of a\nresonant mechanical supermode that provides a mechanically-mediated, efficient\nsingle interface to both the microwave and optical domains. The conversion\nprocess is analyzed by applying an equivalent circuit model that relates\ndevice-level parameters to overall figures of merit for conversion efficiency\n$\\eta$ and added noise $N$. These can be further enhanced by proper impedance\nmatching of the transducer to an input microwave transmission line.

For each such challenge, we\nexplain the issue, provide our approach, and relate to prior art where\napplicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

During the inflationary phase of a string-inspired Universe, and its\nsubsequent exit, the existence of primordial gravitational waves induce\ngravitational anomalies, which couple to the Kalb-Ramond (KR)axion field of the\nmassless gravitational string multiplet. Such anomalous CP violating\ninteractions have two important effects: first, they lead to contributions to\nthe vacuum energy density of the form appearing in the \"running vacuum model\"\n(RVM) framework, proportional to both the square and the fourth power of the\neffective Hubble parameter $H$, the $H^4$ terms being associated with\nanomaly-induced inflation within the RVM framework. Second, there is an\nundiluted KR axion at the end of inflation, which plays an important role in\ngenerating matter-antimatter asymmetry through baryogenesis via leptogenesis in\nmodels with heavy right handed neutrinos. As the Universe exits inflation and\nenters a radiation dominated era, the generation of chiral fermionic matter is\nresponsible for the cancellation of gravitational anomalies, thus restoring\ndiffeomorphism invariance for the matter/radiation (quantum) theory, as\nrequired for consistency. Chiral U(1) anomalies may remain uncompensated,\nthough, during matter/radiation dominance, providing RVM-like $H^2$ and $H^4$\ncontributions to the Universe energy density. Finally, in the current era,\ngravitational anomalies resurface, leading to much weaker RVM-like $H_0^2$\ncontributions to the vacuum energy density.Our model favours axionic Dark\nMatter,the source of which can be the KR axion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 06:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 17:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 17:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

This paper proposes a\nframework in which robots first exchange compact queries to identify a set of\npotential loop closures. We then seek to select a subset of potential\ninter-robot loop closures for geometric verification that maximizes a monotone\nsubmodular performance metric without exceeding budgets on computation (number\nof geometric verifications) and communication (amount of exchanged data for\ngeometric verification). We demonstrate that this problem is in general\nNP-hard, and present efficient approximation algorithms with provable\nperformance guarantees.

However, visual and/or\ncaliper-based estimations of coalescing, necrotic, ShB disease lesions are\ntime-consuming, labor-intensive and exposed to human rater subjectivity. Here,\nwe propose the use of RGB images and image processing techniques to quantify\nShB disease progression in terms of lesion height and diseased area. To be\nspecific, we developed a pixel color- and coordinate-based K-Means Clustering\n(PCC-KMC) algorithm utilizing Mahalanobis metric aimed at accurate segmentation\nof symptomatic and non-symptomatic regions within rice stem images. The\nperformance of PCC-KMC was evaluated using Lin's concordance correlation\ncoefficient by comparing its results to visual measurements of ShB lesion\nheight and to lesion/diseased area measured using ImageJ. Low bias and high\nprecision were observed for absolute lesion height (bias=0.93, precision=0.94)\nand absolute symptomatic area (bias=0.98, precision=0.97) studies. Moreover, we\nintroduced a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic annotation on\nclusters, termed PCC-KMC-CNN.

We interpret these\nobservations in terms of an extended, magnetocentrifugally driven disk wind\nthat transports grains from the inner disk--where they are thermally processed\nby the stellar radiation after being uplifted from the disk surfaces--to the\nouter disk regions. For any disk radius $r$ there is a maximum grain size\n$a_\\mathrm{max}(r)$ that can be uplifted from that location: grains of size\n$a$$\\ll$$a_\\mathrm{max}$ are carried away by the wind, whereas those with\n$a$$\\lesssim$$a_\\mathrm{max}$ reenter the disk at larger radii.

The massive genomic data\nproduced by various genome sequencing technologies presents a significant\nchallenge for genome analysis. Because of errors from sequencing machines and\ngenetic variations, approximate pattern matching (APM) is a must for practical\ngenome analysis. Recent work proposes FPGA, ASIC and even\nprocess-in-memory-based accelerators to boost the APM throughput by\naccelerating dynamic-programming-based algorithms (e.g., Smith-Waterman).\nHowever, existing accelerators lack the efficient hardware acceleration for the\nexact pattern matching (EPM) that is an even more critical and essential\nfunction widely used in almost every step of genome analysis including\nassembly, alignment, annotation and compression.\n  State-of-the-art genome analysis adopts the FM-Index that augments the\nspace-efficient BWT with additional data structures permitting fast EPM\noperations.

In particular,\na set of possible future behaviors generated by the system must be diverse to\naccount for all possible outcomes in order to take necessary safety\nprecautions. It is not sufficient to maintain a set of the most likely future\noutcomes because the set may only contain perturbations of a single outcome.\nWhile generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been shown\nto be a powerful tool for learning a distribution over future trajectories,\nrandomly drawn samples from the learned implicit likelihood model may not be\ndiverse -- the likelihood model is derived from the training data distribution\nand the samples will concentrate around the major mode that has most data. In\nthis work, we propose to learn a diversity sampling function (DSF) that\ngenerates a diverse and likely set of future trajectories. The DSF maps\nforecasting context features to a set of latent codes which can be decoded by a\ngenerative model (e.g., VAE) into a set of diverse trajectory samples.\nConcretely, the process of identifying the diverse set of samples is posed as a\nparameter estimation of the DSF. To learn the parameters of the DSF, the\ndiversity of the trajectory samples is evaluated by a diversity loss based on a\ndeterminantal point process (DPP).

However, existing domain adaptation approaches overwhelmingly\nneglect the degrees of difficulty and deploy exactly the same framework for all\nof the target samples. Generally, a simple or shadow framework is fast but\nrough. A sophisticated or deep framework, on the contrary, is accurate but\nslow. In this paper, we aim to challenge the fundamental contradiction between\nthe accuracy and speed in domain adaptation tasks.

We consider the evolution of an elongated, axisymmetric cocoon formed\nby a choked jet as it expands into a cold power-law ambient medium $\\rho\n\\propto R^{-\\alpha}$, in the case where the shock is decelerating ($\\alpha<3$).\nThe evolution proceeds in three stages, with two breaks in behaviour: the first\noccurs once the outflow has doubled its initial width, and the second once it\nhas doubled its initial height. Using the Kompaneets approximation, we derive\nanalytical formulae for the shape of the cocoon shock, and obtain approximate\nexpressions for the height and width of the outflow versus time in each of the\nthree dynamical regimes.

Rev. Lett.\n86, 559 (2001)]. In this experiment, a selective scattering of photons from\njust one interfering path causes decoherence. However, contrary to\nexpectations, there is an increase in the contrast of the interference pattern,\ndemonstrating that path selective decoherence can not only lead to a decrease,\nbut under certain conditions, to an increase of the fringe contrast. Here we\nexplain this seemingly counter-intuitive effect based on a model for a\nmulti-path interference, with four to six slits, in the presence of\ndecoherence. The effect of the environment is modeled via a coupling to a bath\nof harmonic oscillators. When decoherence is introduced in one of the multiple\npaths, an enhancement in fringe contrast is seen under certain conditions. A\nsimilar effect is shown to appear if instead of path-selective decoherence, a\nselective path detector is introduced. Our analysis points to the fact that\nwhile traditional fringe visibility captures the wave nature in the two-path\ncase, it can fail in multi-path situations. We explain the enhancement of\nfringe visibility and also show that quantum coherence based on the l1 norm of\ncoherence, in contrast to traditional visibility, remains a good quantifier of\nwave nature, even in such situations. The enhancement of fringe contrast in the\npresence of environmental decoherence underscores the limitations of\ntraditional visibility as a good measure for wave nature in quantifying\ncomplementarity and also makes it an unlikely candidate for quantifying\ndecoherence.

A Lie algebra which satisfies the above\ncondition will be called rigid. The most famous example is the Lie algebra\nsl(2,C) of square matrices of order $2$ with vanishing trace.

Despite promising\nresults are obtained by such deep metric learning methods, they, however, fail\nto exploit a crucial cue relevant for localization, namely, the spatial layout\nof local features.

To the best of our knowledge, there is little research about AU\nanalysis for micro-expressions. In this paper, we focus on AU detection in\nmicro-expressions. Microexpression AU detection is challenging due to the small\nquantity of micro-expression databases, low intensity, short duration of facial\nmuscle change, and class imbalance. In order to alleviate the problems, we\npropose a novel Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Pooling (STAP) network for AU\ndetection in micro-expressions. Firstly, STAP is aggregated by a series of\nconvolutional filters of different sizes. In this way, STAP can obtain\nmulti-scale information on spatial and temporal domains. On the other hand,\nSTAP contains less parameters, thus it has less computational cost and is\nsuitable for micro-expression AU detection on very small databases.\nFurthermore, STAP module is designed to pool discriminative information for\nmicro-expression AUs on spatial and temporal domains.Finally, Focal loss is\nemployed to prevent the vast number of negatives from overwhelming the\nmicroexpression AU detector. In experiments, we firstly polish the AU\nannotations on three commonly used databases. We conduct intensive experiments\non three micro-expression databases, and provide several baseline results on\nmicro-expression AU detection. The results show that our proposed approach\noutperforms the basic Inflated inception-v1 (I3D) in terms of an average of F1-\nscore. We also evaluate the performance of our proposed method on\ncross-database protocol. It demonstrates that our proposed approach is feasible\nfor cross-database micro-expression AU detection.

This computational complexity has been the main obstacle to\nunderstanding various fundamental emergent phenomena in condensed matters such\nas high-Tc superconductivity and the fractional quantum-Hall effect. The\ndifficulty arises because even the simplest models that are proposed to capture\nthose phenomena cannot be simulated on a classical computer. Recognizing this\nproblem in 1981, Richard Feynman envisioned a quantum simulator, an entirely\nnew type of machine that exploits quantum superposition and operates by\nindividually manipulating its constituting quantum particles and their\ninteractions. Recent advances in various experimental platforms from cold atoms\nin optical lattices, trapped ions, to solid-state systems have brought the idea\nof Feynman to the realm of reality. Among those, interacting photons in\nsuperconducting circuits has been one of the promising platforms thanks to\ntheir local controllability and long coherence times. Early theoretical\nproposals have shown possibilities to realize quantum many-body phenomena of\nlight using coupled cavity arrays such as Mott to superfluid transitions and\nfractional quantum Hall states. Start-of-the-art experiments include\nrealization of interacting chiral edge states and stroboscopic signatures of\nlocalization of interacting photons in a three-site and a nine-site\nsuperconducting circuit, respectively. Interacting photons also serve as a\nnatural platform to simulate driven-dissipative quantum many-body phenomena. A\n72-site superconducting circuit has also recently been fabricated to study a\ndissipative phase transition of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

While many of its statistical properties under different probabilistic\nmodels for phylogenetic trees have already been established, little is known\nabout its minimum value and the trees that achieve it. In this manuscript, we\nfill this gap in the literature. To begin with, we derive both recursive and\nclosed expressions for the minimum Colless index of a tree with $n$ leaves.\nSurprisingly, these expressions show a connection between the minimum Colless\nindex and the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve. We then fully\ncharacterize the tree shapes that achieve this minimum value and we introduce\nboth an algorithm to generate them and a recurrence to count them.

The\nquestion is how to choose a scoring rule for a specific application. First, we\nderive a one-parameter family with geometric scores which satisfies two\nprinciples of independence: once an extremely strong or weak candidate is\nremoved, the aggregate ranking ought to remain intact. This family includes\nBorda count, generalised plurality (medal count), and generalised antiplurality\n(threshold rule) as edge cases, and we find which additional axioms\ncharacterise these rules. Second, we introduce a one-parameter family with\noptimal scores: the athletes should be ranked according to their expected\noverall quality. Finally, using historical data from biathlon, golf, and\nathletics we demonstrate how the geometric and optimal scores can simplify the\nselection of suitable scoring rules, show that these scores closely resemble\nthe actual scores used by the organisers, and provide an explanation for\nempirical phenomena observed in biathlon and golf tournaments.

Two of the most\ncommonly studied fairness concepts in cake cutting are proportionality and\nenvy-freeness. It is well known that a proportional allocation among $n$ agents\ncan be found efficiently via simple protocols [16]. For envy-freeness, in a\nrecent breakthrough, Aziz and Mackenzie [5] proposed a discrete and bounded\nenvy-free protocol for any number of players. However, the protocol suffers\nfrom high multiple-exponential query complexity and it remains open to find\nsimpler and more efficient envy-free protocols.\n  In this paper we consider a variation of the cake cutting problem by assuming\nan underlying graph over the agents whose edges describe their acquaintance\nrelationships, and agents evaluate their shares relatively to those of their\nneighbors. An allocation is called locally proportional if each agent thinks\nshe receives at least the average value over her neighbors. Local\nproportionality generalizes proportionality and is in an interesting middle\nground between proportionality and envy-freeness: its existence is guaranteed\nby that of an envy-free allocation, but no simple protocol is known to produce\nsuch a locally proportional allocation for general graphs. Previous works\nshowed locally proportional protocols for special classes of graphs, and it is\nlisted in both [1] and [8] as an open question to design simple locally\nproportional protocols for more general classes of graphs. In this paper we\ncompletely resolved this open question by presenting a discrete and bounded\nlocally proportional protocol for any given graphs. Our protocol has a query\ncomplexity of only single exponential, which is significantly smaller than the\nsix towers of $n$ query complexity of the envy-free protocol given in [5].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 10:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

The pair of clusters is chosen to\n(locally) minimize the $k$-means cost of the clustering in the next step.\n  Complete linkage algorithms are very popular for hierarchical clustering\nproblems, yet their theoretical properties have been studied relatively little.\nFor the Euclidean $k$-center problem, Ackermann et al. show that the\n$k$-clustering in the hierarchy computed by complete linkage has a worst-case\napproximation ratio of $\\Theta(\\log k)$.

We found that\nthe transition pressure exhibits a minimum when Th/(U+Th) = 0.50 i.e. when the\nunit cell contains equal amount of U and Th. Any change in normalized Th\ncontent, as we move towards the U and Th end-members of the series, shows a\nsignificant jump in zircon-reidite transition pressure. In order to explain\nthis behavior, we proposed a novel method of quantifying the distortions of\nU/Th-coordination polyhedra which manifest themselves as a triangular\ndodecahedron or snub-disphenoid. We have theoretically defined two parameters:\none related to the two geometrically different U/Th-O bond lengths, having a\nfixed ratio between them for regular triangular dodecahedra irrespective of the\nvolume and the other with three kinds of O-U-O and O-Th-O bond angles with\nmultiplicities of 2, 4 and 12, respectively. The bond angle distortion for both\nU and Th-polyhedra were found to show a maximum in zircon phase and a minimum\nin reidite phase corresponding to Th/(U+Th) = 0.5. Since, the difference in\nangular distortion is minimum in case of Th/(U+Th) = 0.5, a lesser hydrostatic\npressure is capable of triggering the transition, compared to the other members\nof this series. The bond length distortion is also characterized by a maximum\nin the reidite phase at the equal concentration of U and Th. Our finding is\nalso complemented by the minimum compressibility observed in the zircon phase\nwhen the atomic percentage of U and Th are equal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 11:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

However, deep\nlearning methods in general are not yet widely used in practice since they\nrequire large amount of data for training complex models. This is particularly\nchallenging for biomedical images, because data and ground truths are a scarce\nresource. Annotation efforts for biomedical images come with a real cost, since\nexperts have to manually label images at pixel-level on samples usually\ncontaining many instances of the target anatomy (e.g. in histology samples:\nneurons, astrocytes, mitochondria, etc.). In this paper we provide a framework\nfor Deep Active Learning applied to a real-world scenario. Our framework relies\non the U-Net architecture and overall uncertainty measure to suggest which\nsample to annotate. It takes advantage of the uncertainty measure obtained by\ntaking Monte Carlo samples while using Dropout regularization scheme.\nExperiments were done on spinal cord and brain microscopic histology samples to\nperform a myelin segmentation task. Two realistic small datasets of 14 and 24\nimages were used, from different acquisition settings (Serial Block-Face\nElectron Microscopy and Transmitting Electron Microscopy) and showed that our\nmethod reached a maximum Dice value after adding 3 uncertainty-selected samples\nto the initial training set, versus 15 randomly-selected samples, thereby\nsignificantly reducing the annotation effort.

We show that more than half the\nvariation in traffic volume and disruptions can be explained with static\nfeatures alone, and use cross-validation and recursive feature elimination to\nevaluate the predictive power and importance of different land use categories.\nFinally, we show that using OSM's granular point of interest data allows for\nbetter predictions than the aggregate categories typically used in studies of\ntransportation and land use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 12:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

To guarantee the consistency of off-line training and on-line\nserving, we usually utilize the same features that are both available.

For example,\nwhen estimating the conversion rate (CVR), i.e., the probability that a user\nwould purchase the item if she clicked it, features like dwell time on the item\ndetailed page are informative. However, CVR prediction should be conducted for\non-line ranking before the click happens.

In this study, the model-based predictive control (MPC) was combined\nwith a social-force based vehicle-crowd interaction (VCI) model to regulate the\nlongitudinal speed of the autonomous vehicle. The predictive feature of the VCI\nmodel can be precisely utilized by the MPC.

We evaluate the model on a subspectrum of the retinal\nmaculopathies, in particular, exudative age-related macular degeneration,\ncentral serous chorioretinopathy, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. For\nthese three maculopathies, a database of 3000 6-dimensional pVecs (1000 each)\nwas synthetically generated based on known disease statistics in the\nliterature. The database was then used to train the VAE and generate latent\nvector representations.

We study these vibrations and the possible\nobservational effects. Here we theoretically investigate the collective\noscillations inherent to the fine structure of the corona. We have called them\nfundamental vibrations because they cannot exist in a uniform medium. We use\nthe T-matrix technique to find the normal modes of random arrangements of\nparallel strands. We consider an increasing number of tubes to understand the\nvibrations of a huge number of tubes of a large portion of the corona.

Such systems bring with them myriad benefits:\nstraightforward upgrade paths, cost savings through leveraging an economy of\nscale, and a lowered barrier to entry for scientists and engineers seeking to\nadd new instrument capabilities. Additionally, the typical data-interconnect\ntechnology used with general-purpose computing hardware -- Ethernet --\nnaturally permits multiple subscribers to a single raw data stream. This allows\nmultiple science programs to be conducted in parallel. When combined with broad\nbandwidths and wide primary fields of view, radio telescopes become capable of\nachieving many science goals simultaneously. Moreover, because many science\nprograms are not strongly dependent on observing cadence and direction (e.g.\nsearches for extraterrestrial intelligence and radio transient surveys), these\nso-called \"commensal\" observing programs can dramatically increase the\nscientific productivity and discovery potential of an observatory. In this\nwhitepaper, we detail a project to add an Ethernet-based commensal observing\nmode to the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and discuss how this mode could be\nleveraged to conduct a powerful program to constrain the distribution of\nadvanced life in the universe through a search for radio emission indicative of\ntechnology. We also discuss other potential science use-cases for the system,\nand how the system could be used for technology development towards\nnext-generation processing systems for the Next Generation VLA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

Here traces collect, for instance, the externally observable events\nof each execution. This definition requires, however, the set of traces of the\nsource and target languages to be exactly the same, which is not the case when\nthe languages are far apart or when observations are fine-grained. To overcome\nthis issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition, which uses\nsource and target traces drawn from potentially different sets and connected by\nan arbitrary relation. We set out to understand what guarantees this\ngeneralized compiler correctness definition gives us when instantiated with a\nnon-trivial relation on traces. When this trace relation is not equality, it is\nno longer possible to preserve the trace properties of the source program\nunchanged.

The DNS\ndata enable accurate maps of the outer irrotational flow field, and also the\nvorticity field in the turbulent core of the jet. It is found necessary to\ndefine two separate boundaries of the jet. The first is an inner boundary\n(turbulent/nonturbulent, T/NT), from where vorticity rises steeply towards to\nthe core. The second is an outer rotational/irrotational boundary, beyond which\nthe flow may be considered irrotational. The velocity field beyond the outer\nboundary often has ordered, nearly irrotational circulatory motions. These can\nbe shown, in simpler cases, to be the velocity field induced by one or more\nvorticity elements in a coherent structure in the turbulent core. A detailed\nexamination of axial and diametral sections indicates that there are periods\nwhen there is a large inrush of ambient fluid into parts of the T/NT interface,\nwhich gets distorted into a gulf or well that can be both twisted and deep.\nSections of these wells often appear as what may be called as lakes of\nirrotational fluid in diametral sections of the jet flow. Part of the inrushing\nfluid crosses the T/NT interface within the well and is entrained into the\nturbulent core, by a process that can legitimately be called nibbling. The\nduration of such an inrush process can be of the order up to 20 flow units and\nsuggests that entrainment can be an episodic process in which an inrush event\naccelerates ambient fluid even as it is pushed into a narrowing gulf, where it\npenetrates the T/NT interface of the gulf by nibbling.

The M-gPC technique extends the generalized\npolynomial chaos (gPC) theory originally developed in the uncertainty\nquantification community, such that it can efficiently handle the mixed-type\n(i.e., both continuous and discrete) uncertainties in computer architecture\ndesign.

Those perturbations are\ndesigned to be misclassified by the neural network, while being perceptually\nidentical to some valid input. The vast majority of attack methods rely on\nwhite-box conditions, where the attacker has full knowledge of the attacked\nnetwork's parameters. This allows the attacker to calculate the network's loss\ngradient with respect to some valid input and use this gradient in order to\ncreate an adversarial example. The task of blocking white-box attacks has\nproven difficult to solve. While a large number of defense methods have been\nsuggested, they have had limited success. In this work we examine this\ndifficulty and try to understand it. We systematically explore the abilities\nand limitations of defensive distillation, one of the most promising defense\nmechanisms against adversarial perturbations suggested so far in order to\nunderstand the defense challenge. We show that contrary to commonly held\nbelief, the ability to bypass defensive distillation is not dependent on an\nattack's level of sophistication. In fact, simple approaches, such as the\nTargeted Gradient Sign Method, are capable of effectively bypassing defensive\ndistillation. We prove that defensive distillation is highly effective against\nnon-targeted attacks but is unsuitable for targeted attacks.

We present a\nmachine learning approach to wind velocity estimation based on quadcopter state\nmeasurements without a wind sensor. We accomplish this by training a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) on roll and pitch angles and\nquadcopter position inputs with forcing wind velocities as the targets. The\ndatasets are generated using a simulated quadcopter in turbulent wind fields.\nThe trained neural network is deployed to estimate the turbulent winds as\ngenerated by the Dryden gust model as well as a realistic large eddy simulation\n(LES) of a near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over flat terrain. The\nresulting NN predictions are compared to a wind triangle approach that uses\ntilt angle as an approximation of airspeed. Results from this study indicate\nthat the LSTM-NN based approach predicts lower errors in both the mean and\nvariance of the local wind field as compared to the wind triangle approach. The\nwork reported in this article demonstrates the potential of machine learning\nfor sensor-less wind estimation and has strong implications to large-scale\nlow-altitude atmospheric sensing using sUAS for environmental and autonomous\nnavigation applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 04:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

However, most existing deep\nnetworks trained for these operators are only designed for one specific\nparameter configuration, which does not meet the needs of real scenarios that\nusually require flexible parameters settings. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a new decoupled learning algorithm to learn from the operator\nparameters to dynamically adjust the weights of a deep network for image\noperators, denoted as the base network. The learned algorithm is formed as\nanother network, namely the weight learning network, which can be end-to-end\njointly trained with the base network.

As a result, we obtain\nclosed-form theoretical expressions linking fundamental system design and\nenvironment parameters with the power consumption of analog front ends for\ncommunication receivers. This collection of scaling laws and bounds is meant to\nserve as a theoretical reference for practical low power front end design. In\none set of results, we first find that the front end power consumption scales\nat least as SNDR^3/2 if environment parameters (fading and blocker levels) are\nstatic. The obtained scaling law is subsequently used to derive relations\nbetween front end power consumption and several other important communication\nsystem parameters, namely, digital modulation constellation size, symbol error\nprobability, error control coding gain and coding rate. Such relations, in\nturn, can be used when deciding which system design strategies to adopt for\nlow-power applications. For example, if error control coding is employed, the\nmost energy-efficient strategy for the entire receiver is to use codes with\nmoderate coding gain and simple decoding algorithms, such as convolutional\ncodes. In another collection of results, we find how front end power scales\nwith environment parameters if the performance is kept constant. This yields\nbounds on average power reduction of receivers that adapt to the communication\nenvironment. For instance, if a receiver front end adapts to fading\nfluctuations while keeping the performance above some given minimum\nrequirement, power can theoretically be reduced at least 20x compared to a\nnon-adaptive front end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 21:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

For governments, financial management of the policy is very\nchallenging as that it needs a considerable amount of budget to support RE\nproducers during the long remuneration period. In this paper, we illuminate\nthat the early growth of REs capacity could be a temporary boost and the system\nelements would backlash the policy if financial circumstances are not handled\nwell. To show this, we chose Iran as the case, which is in the infancy period\nof FiT implementation. Iran started the implementation of FiT policy in 2015\naiming to achieve 5 GW of renewable capacity until 2021. Analyses show that the\nprobable financial crisis will not only lead to inefficient REs development\nafter the target time (2021), but may also cause the existing plants to fail.\nSocial tolerance for paying REs tax and potential investors trust emanated from\nbudget related mechanisms are taken into consideration in the system dynamics\nmodel developed in this research to reflect those financial effects, which have\nrarely been considered in the previous researches. To prevent the financial\ncrisis of the FiT funding and to maintain the stable growth in long term, three\npolicy scenarios are analyzed: continuation of the current program with higher\nFiT rates, adjusting the FiT rates based on the budget status, and adjusting\nthe tax on electricity consumption for the development of REs based on the\nbudget status. The results demonstrate that adjusting the tax on electricity\nconsumption for the development of REs based on budget status leads to the best\npolicy result for a desired installed capacity development without any negative\nsocial effects and financial crises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 10:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

Our method aims to capture the best-exposed image which can boost\nthe performance of various computer vision and robotics tasks. For this\npurpose, we carefully design an image quality metric which captures\ncomplementary quality attributes and ensures light-weight computation.\nSpecifically, our metric consists of a combination of image gradient, entropy,\nand noise metrics. The synergy of these measures allows preserving sharp edge\nand rich texture in the image while maintaining a low noise level. Using this\nnovel metric, we propose a real-time and fully automatic exposure and gain\ncontrol technique based on the Nelder-Mead method. To illustrate the\neffectiveness of our technique, a large set of experimental results\ndemonstrates higher qualitative and quantitative performances when compared\nwith conventional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 04:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

However, here we\nobserve that this does not necessarily hold true for allosterically regulated\nenzymes, often observed in signaling networks. In particular, we find that the\nmutual information between the catalytic sites of an allosterically regulated\nenzyme and a receiver protein downstream in the signaling pathway depends on\nthe transition kinetics between the different allosterically regulated states\nof the enzyme and their respective rates of product formation. Surprisingly,\nour work implies that allosteric down-regulation of an enzyme's rate of product\nformation may not only be used as a way to silence itself, as one would\nnormally expect. Rather, down-regulation may also be used to increase the\ninformation communicated by this enzyme to a receiver protein downstream in a\nsignaling pathway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 20:04:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 18:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 06:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Conventional LN electro-optic modulators\nwhile continue to be the workhorse of the optoelectronic industry become\nprogressively too bulky, expensive and power hungry to fully serve the needs of\nthis industry rapidly progressing towards highly integrated, cost-effective and\nenergy efficient components and circuits. Recently developed monolithic LN\nnanophotonic platform enables the realization of electro-optic modulators that\nare significantly improved in terms of compactness, bandwidth and energy\nefficiency, while still demanding relatively long, on the mm-scale, interaction\nlengths. Here we successfully deal with this challenge and demonstrate\nplasmonic electro-optic directional coupler switches consisting of two closely\nspaced nm-thin gold nanostripes monolithically fabricated on LN substrates that\nguide both coupled electromagnetic modes and electrical signals influencing\ntheir coupling and thereby enabling ultra-compact switching and\nmodulatiofunctionalities. The extreme confinement of both slow-plasmon modes\nand electrostatic fields created by two nanostripes along with their nearly\nperfect spatial overlap allowed us to achieve a 90% modulation depth with\n20-$\\mu$m-long switches characterized by a electro-optic modulation efficiency\nof 0.3 Vcm. Our monolithic LN plasmonic platform enables ultra-dense\nintegration of high-performance active photonic components, enabling a wide\nrange of cost-effective optical communication applications demanding\n$\\mu$m-scale footprints, ultrafast operation, robust design and high\nenvironmental stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 10:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

This paper\npresents an expert system for an Elderly Health Care (EHC) at elderly home\ntailored for the specific needs of Elderly. The proposed EHC aims to develop an\nintegrated and multidisciplinary method to employ communication technologies\nand information for covering real health needs of elderly people, mainly of\npeople at high risk due to social and geographic isolation in addition to\nspecific chronic diseases. The proposed EHC provides personalized intervention\nplans covering chronic diseases such as (body temperature (BT), blood pressure\n(BP), and Heart beat rate (HR)). The processes and architecture of the proposed\nEHC are based on the server side and three main clients, one for the elderly\nand another two for the nurse and the physicians whom take care of them.
