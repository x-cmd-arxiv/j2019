As a consequence, quantum bits\n(qubits) undergo errors, putting dauntingly difficult constraints on the\nhardware suitable for quantum computation. New strategies are emerging to\ncircumvent this problem by encoding a qubit non-locally across the phase space\nof a physical system. Since most sources of decoherence are due to local\nfluctuations, the foundational promise is to exponentially suppress errors by\nincreasing a measure of this non-locality. Prominent examples are topological\nqubits which delocalize quantum information over real space and where spatial\nextent measures non-locality. In this work, we encode a qubit in the field\nquadrature space of a superconducting resonator endowed with a special\nmechanism that dissipates photons in pairs. This process pins down two\ncomputational states to separate locations in phase space. As we increase this\nseparation, we measure an exponential decrease of the bit-flip rate while only\nlinearly increasing the phase-flip rate. Since bit-flips are continuously and\nautonomously corrected at the single qubit level, only phase-flips are left to\nbe corrected via a one-dimensional quantum error correction code. This\nexponential scaling demonstrates that resonators with non-linear dissipation\nare promising building blocks for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation\nwith drastically reduced hardware overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

However, we argue that instead of\nbeing invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an\nenvironment and exploit them to achieve better performance. In this work, we\npropose the 'Environment-Probing' Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that\nprobes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that\nenvironment's behavior.

To develop a Halo-EFT model of\n$^{15}$C at NLO, we first extract the ANC of its ground state by analyzing\n$^{14}$C(d,p)$^{15}$C transfer data at low energy. Using this Halo-EFT\ndescription, we study the $^{15}$C Coulomb breakup at high (605AMeV) and\nintermediate (68AMeV) energies using eikonal models with a consistent treatment\nof nuclear and Coulomb interactions at all orders, and proper relativistic\ncorrections. Finally, we study the $^{14}$C(n,$\\gamma$)$^{15}$C radiative\ncapture. Our theoretical cross sections are in good agreement with experimental\ndata for all reactions, thereby assessing the robustness of the $^{15}$C\nHalo-EFT model. Since a simple NLO description is enough to reproduce all data,\nthe only nuclear-structure observables that matter are the binding energy and\nits ANC, showing that all the reactions considered are purely peripheral. In\nparticular, it confirms the ANC value obtained for the $^{15}$C ground state:\n1.59$\\pm$0.06fm$^{-1}$. Our model provides also a new estimate of the\nradiative-capture cross section at astrophysical energy (23.3keV):\n4.66$\\pm$0.14$\\mu$b. Including a Halo-EFT description of $^{15}$C within\nprecise models of reactions is confirmed to be an excellent way to relate the\nnucleus reaction cross sections and structure. Its systematic expansion enables\nus to deduce which nuclear-structure observables are actually probed in the\ncollision. From this, we can infer valuable information on both the structure\nof $^{15}$C and its synthesis through the $^{14}$C(n,$\\gamma$)$^{15}$C\nradiative capture at astrophysical energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 18:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 09:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Traditional extrapolation schemes use all time\nstepping sequences to maximize the method's order of accuracy. The present\nmethod instead maintains a desired order of accuracy while employing additional\ntime stepping sequences to shape the resulting stability domain. We optimize\nthe extrapolation coefficients to maximize the stability domain's imaginary\naxis coverage. This yields a family of explicit schemes that approaches maximal\ntime step size for wave propagation problems. On a computer with several cores\nwe achieve both high order and fast time to solution compared with traditional\nODE integrators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 19:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

This work continues this line of research by adapting maximum\ncausal entropy inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the posteriori\nprobability of a specification given a multi-set of demonstrations. The key\nalgorithmic insight is to leverage the extensive literature and tooling on\nreduced ordered binary decision diagrams to efficiently encode a time unrolled\nMarkov Decision Process.

This paper\npresents an approach to extract human design strategies and implicit rules,\npurely from historical human data, and use that for design generation.

Different from the flat 2D images,\nthe detection task is challenging for 360{\\deg} images due to the distortion of\nERP and the inefficiency of perspective projections. However, existing methods\nmostly focus on one of the above representations instead of both, leading to\nlimited detection performance. Moreover, the lack of appropriate bounding-box\nannotations as well as the annotated datasets further increases the\ndifficulties of the detection task. In this paper, we present a standard object\ndetection framework for 360{\\deg} images. Specifically, we adapt the\nterminologies of the traditional object detection task to the omnidirectional\nscenarios, and propose a novel two-stage object detector, i.e., Reprojection\nR-CNN by combining both ERP and perspective projection. Owing to the\nomnidirectional field-of-view of ERP, Reprojection R-CNN first generates coarse\nregion proposals efficiently by a distortion-aware spherical region proposal\nnetwork.

We construct two\nnovel synthetic datasets for training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that\nReprojection R-CNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the mAP\nmetric.

As\nrequired by new data protection regulations and laws, when PII leakage occurs,\none must be able to reliably identify the leaking sources. Existing solutions\nutilize watermark technologies or data object allocation strategies to\ndifferentiate the data shared with different parties to identify potential\nleakers. However, these solutions lose their effectiveness under several attack\nscenarios, e.g., a data sender may leak the data and a receiver may deny the\nreception of certain shared data. Worse yet, multiple receivers might collude\nand apply a set of operations such as intersection, complement, and union to\ntheir received datasets before leaking them, making the task of leaker\nidentification even more difficult.\n  In this paper, we propose AuditShare, a PII dataset sharing system with\nreliable leaking source identification.

Recently, deep learning\n(DL)-based CSI feedback conquers many difficulties, yet still shows\ninsufficiency to decrease the occupation of uplink bandwidth resources. In this\npaper, to solve this issue, we combine DL and superimposed coding (SC) for CSI\nfeedback, in which the downlink CSI is spread and then superimposed on uplink\nuser data sequences (UL-US) toward the BS.

Alternative pretreatment strategies for prognosis of NPC after\ntreatment are needed to provide better risk stratification for NPC.

Specifically, the area of human\nactivity recognition (HAR) is primarily transformed by the convolutional and\nrecurrent neural networks, thanks to their ability to learn semantic\nrepresentations from raw input. However, to extract generalizable features,\nmassive amounts of well-curated data are required, which is a notoriously\nchallenging task; hindered by privacy issues, and annotation costs. Therefore,\nunsupervised representation learning is of prime importance to leverage the\nvast amount of unlabeled data produced by smart devices. In this work, we\npropose a novel self-supervised technique for feature learning from sensory\ndata that does not require access to any form of semantic labels. We learn a\nmulti-task temporal convolutional network to recognize transformations applied\non an input signal. By exploiting these transformations, we demonstrate that\nsimple auxiliary tasks of the binary classification result in a strong\nsupervisory signal for extracting useful features for the downstream task. We\nextensively evaluate the proposed approach on several publicly available\ndatasets for smartphone-based HAR in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and\ntransfer learning settings.

As deblurring can be considered as an\nimage to image translation task, deep learning based solutions, including the\nones which use GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), have been proven effective\nfor deblurring. Most of them have an encoder-decoder structure. Our objective\nis to try different GAN structures and improve its performance through various\nmodifications to the existing structure for supervised deblurring. In\nsupervised deblurring we have pairs of blurred and their corresponding sharp\nimages, while in the unsupervised case we have a set of blurred and sharp\nimages but their is no correspondence between them. Modifications to the\nstructures is done to improve the global perception of the model. As blur is\nnon-uniform in nature, for deblurring we require global information of the\nentire image, whereas convolution used in CNN is able to provide only local\nperception. Deep models can be used to improve global perception but due to\nlarge number of parameters it becomes difficult for it to converge and\ninference time increases, to solve this we propose the use of attention module\n(non-local block) which was previously used in language translation and other\nimage to image translation tasks in deblurring. Use of residual connection also\nimproves the performance of deblurring as features from the lower layers are\nadded to the upper layers of the model.

The recently\nproposed DIFFVC avoids the use of a vocoder, meanwhile preserves rich spectral\ndetails hence capable of generating high quality converted voice. To apply the\nDIFFVC framework, a model that can estimate the spectral differential from the\nF0 transformed input speech needs to be trained beforehand. This requirement\nimposes several constraints, including a limitation on the estimation model to\nparallel training and the need of extra training on each conversion pair, which\nmake DIFFVC inflexible. Based on the above motivations, we propose a new DIFFVC\nframework based on an F0 transformation in the residual domain. By performing\ninverse filtering on the input signal followed by synthesis filtering on the F0\ntransformed residual signal using the converted spectral features directly, the\nspectral conversion model does not need to be retrained or capable of\npredicting the spectral differential. We describe several details that need to\nbe taken care of under this modification, and by applying our proposed method\nto a non-parallel, variational autoencoder (VAE)-based spectral conversion\nmodel, we demonstrate that this framework can be generalized to any spectral\nconversion model, and experimental evaluations show that it can outperform a\nbaseline framework whose waveform generation process is carried out by a\nvocoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2019 11:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

This paper attempts to\naddress these limitations using jerk based control architectures. The proposed\ncontrollers assume the rate-of-change of the joint torques as control input,\nand exploit the system position, velocity, accelerations, and contact wrenches\nas measurable quantities. The key ingredient of the presented approach is a\none-to-one correspondence between free variables and an inner approximation of\nthe manifold defined by the contact stability constraints. More precisely, the\nproposed correspondence covers completely the contact stability manifold except\nfor the so-called friction cone, for which there exists a unique correspondence\nfor more than 90% of its elements.

To overcome\nthese drawbacks, we propose a novel framework termed MaskGAN, enabling diverse\nand interactive face manipulation. Our key insight is that semantic masks serve\nas a suitable intermediate representation for flexible face manipulation with\nfidelity preservation.

Specifically,\nDMN learns style mapping between a free-form user modified mask and a target\nimage, enabling diverse generation results.

We demonstrate the\nadvantages of this framework in three ways: (1) effective---it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art attacks in terms of success rate and perturbation rate, (2)\nutility-preserving---it preserves semantic content and grammaticality, and\nremains correctly classified by humans, and (3) efficient---it generates\nadversarial text with computational complexity linear to the text length. *The\ncode, pre-trained target models, and test examples are available at\nhttps://github.com/jind11/TextFooler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2019 15:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 05:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 07:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 07:16:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 07:12:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 23:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}
