Goal: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners avoid insecure\ncoding practices while developing infrastructure as code scripts through an\nempirical study of security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts. Methodology: We\nconduct a replication study where we apply qualitative analysis with 1,956 IaC\nscripts to identify security smells for IaC scripts written in two languages:\nAnsible and Chef.

Our proposed framework consists of (1) a runway\nembedding learning model that uses fashion runway images to learn every\nseason's collection embedding, and (2) a next-season fashion design prediction\nmodel that leverage the concept of designer style and trend to predict\nnext-season design given designers.

No current or planned facility at a U.S.\nobservatory meets the sensitivity, multiplex, and rapid-response time needed to\nexploit these future datasets. FOBOS, the Fiber-Optic Broadband Optical\nSpectrograph, is a near-term fiber-based facility that addresses these\nspectroscopic needs by optimizing depth over area and exploiting the aperture\nadvantage of the existing 10m Keck II Telescope. The result is an instrument\nwith a uniquely blue-sensitive wavelength range (0.31-1.0 um) at R~3500,\nhigh-multiplex (1800 fibers), and a factor 1.7 greater survey speed and\norder-of-magnitude greater sampling density than Subaru's Prime Focus\nSpectrograph (PFS). In the era of panoramic deep imaging, FOBOS will excel at\nbuilding the deep, spectroscopic reference data sets needed to interpret vast\nimaging data. At the same time, its flexible focal plane, including a mode with\n25 deployable integral-field units (IFUs) across a 20 arcmin diameter field,\nenables an expansive range of scientific investigations. Its key programmatic\nareas include (1) nested stellar-parameter training sets that enable studies of\nthe Milky Way and M31 halo sub-structure, as well as local group dwarf\ngalaxies, (2) a comprehensive picture of galaxy formation thanks to detailed\nmapping of the baryonic environment at z~2 and statistical linking of evolving\npopulations to the present day, and (3) dramatic enhancements in cosmological\nconstraints via precise photometric redshifts and determined redshift\ndistributions. In combination with Keck I instrumentation, FOBOS also provides\ninstant access to medium-resolution spectroscopy for transient sources with\nfull coverage from the UV to the K-band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 18:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

One way to study the crust properties is to measure\nhow it cools after it has been heated during an accretion outburst in a\nlow-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Such studies have shown that there is a\ntantalizing source of heat, of currently unknown origin, that is located in the\nouter layers of the crust and has a strength that varies between different\nsources and different outbursts. With the aim of understanding the mechanism\nbehind this \"shallow heating\", we present Chandra and Swift observations of the\nneutron star LMXB Aql X-1, obtained after its bright 2016 outburst. We find\nthat the neutron star temperature was initially much lower, and started to\ndecrease at much later time, than observed after the 2013 outburst of the\nsource, despite the fact that the properties of the two outbursts were very\nsimilar. Comparing our data to thermal evolution simulations, we infer that the\ndepth and magnitude of shallow heating must have been much larger during the\n2016 outburst than during the 2013 one. This implies that basic neutron star\nparameters that do not change between outbursts, do not play a strong role in\nshallow heating. Furthermore, it suggests that outbursts with a similar\naccretion morphology can give rise to very different shallow heating.

Partial\nfunction extension is previously studied for other function classes, including\nboolean functions and convex functions, and is useful in many fields, such as\nobtaining bounds on learning these function classes.\n  We show that determining extendibility of a partial function to a coverage\nfunction is NP-complete, establishing in the process that there is a\npolynomial-sized certificate of extendibility. The hardness also gives us a\nlower bound for learning coverage functions. We then study two natural notions\nof approximate extension, to account for errors in the data set.

These systems, depend on\nsophisticated learning algorithms and available data, to optimize the service\nfunction for decision support assistance. However, there is a growing concern\nabout the accountability and fairness of the employed models by the fact that\noften the available historic data is intrinsically discriminatory, i.e., the\nproportion of members sharing one or more sensitive attributes is higher than\nthe proportion in the population as a whole when receiving positive\nclassification, which leads to a lack of fairness in decision support system. A\nnumber of fairness-aware learning methods have been proposed to handle this\nconcern. However, these methods tackle fairness as a static problem and do not\ntake the evolution of the underlying stream population into consideration. In\nthis paper, we introduce a learning mechanism to design a fair classifier for\nonline stream based decision-making. Our learning model, FAHT (Fairness-Aware\nHoeffding Tree), is an extension of the well-known Hoeffding Tree algorithm for\ndecision tree induction over streams, that also accounts for fairness.

While solving this large MDP is generally intractable, we show that we\ncan compute oracular selectors that can solve the MDP during training.

There has long been\nan interest in LTR from user interactions, however, this form of implicit\nfeedback is very biased. In recent years, unbiased LTR methods have been\nintroduced to remove the effect of different types of bias caused by\nuser-behavior in search. For instance, a well addressed type of bias is\nposition bias: the rank at which a document is displayed heavily affects the\ninteractions it receives. Counterfactual LTR methods deal with such types of\nbias by learning from historical interactions while correcting for the effect\nof the explicitly modelled biases. Online LTR does not use an explicit user\nmodel, in contrast, it learns through an interactive process where randomized\nresults are displayed to the user. Through randomization the effect of\ndifferent types of bias can be removed from the learning process. Though both\nmethodologies lead to unbiased LTR, their approaches differ considerably,\nfurthermore, so do their theoretical guarantees, empirical results, effects on\nthe user experience during learning, and applicability. Consequently, for\npractitioners the choice between the two is very substantial.

In this paper, motion of 111Cd tracer probe atoms is\nreconsidered following electron-capture decay of 111In in the series of In3R\nphases (R= rare-earth). The motion produces nuclear relaxation that was\nmeasured using the method of perturbed angular correlation. Previous\nmeasurements along the entire series of In3R phases appeared to show a\ncrossover between two diffusional regimes. While relaxation for R= Lu-Tb is\nconsistent with a simple vacancy diffusion mechanism, relaxation for R= Nd-La\nis not. More recent measurements in Pd3R phases demonstrate that the\nsite-preference of the parent In-probe changes along the series and suggests\nthat the same behavior occurs for daughter Cd-probes. The anomalous motion\nobserved for R= Nd-La is attributed to \"lanthanide expansion\" occurring towards\nLa end-member phases. For In3La, the Cd-tracer is found to jump away from its\noriginal location on the In-sublattice in an extremely short time, of order 0.5\nns at 1000 K and 1.2 ms at room temperature, a residence time too short to be\nconsistent with defect-mediated diffusion.

Our\nmethodology frames the problem of neural network verification in terms of a\ncounterexample and syntax-guided inductive synthesis procedure over these\nprograms. The synthesis procedure searches for both a deterministic program and\nan inductive invariant over an infinite state transition system that represents\na specification of an application's control logic. Additional specifications\ndefining environment-based constraints can also be provided to further refine\nthe search space. Synthesized programs deployed in conjunction with a neural\nnetwork implementation dynamically enforce safety conditions by monitoring and\npreventing potentially unsafe actions proposed by neural policies. Experimental\nresults over a wide range of cyber-physical applications demonstrate that\nsoftware-inspired formal verification techniques can be used to realize\ntrustworthy reinforcement learning systems with low overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 21:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

However, most of them deploy few efforts in exploiting label relations,\nwhile such dependencies are crucial for making accurate predictions. Although\nan LSTM layer can be introduced to modeling such label dependencies in a chain\npropagation manner, the efficiency might be questioned when certain labels are\nimproperly inferred. To address this, we propose a novel aerial image\nmulti-label classification network, attention-aware label relational reasoning\nnetwork. Particularly, our network consists of three elemental modules: 1) a\nlabel-wise feature parcel learning module, 2) an attentional region extraction\nmodule, and 3) a label relational inference module. To be more specific, the\nlabel-wise feature parcel learning module is designed for extracting high-level\nlabel-specific features. The attentional region extraction module aims at\nlocalizing discriminative regions in these features and yielding attentional\nlabel-specific features. The label relational inference module finally predicts\nlabel existences using label relations reasoned from outputs of the previous\nmodule. The proposed network is characterized by its capacities of extracting\ndiscriminative label-wise features in a proposal-free way and reasoning about\nlabel relations naturally and interpretably. In our experiments, we evaluate\nthe proposed model on the UCM multi-label dataset and a newly produced dataset,\nAID multi-label dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results on these two\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. To facilitate progress in\nthe multi-label aerial image classification, the AID multi-label dataset will\nbe made publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 22:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 18:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 03:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Our observations resolve three out\nof the four rings in the disk previously seen in high-resolution ALMA data. A\nsimple parametric model is used to estimate the radial profile of the dust\noptical depth, temperature, density, and particle size distribution. We find\nthat the multiple ring features of the disk are produced by annular\naccumulations of large particles, probably associated with gas pressure bumps.\nOur model indicates that the maximum dust grain size in the rings is $\\sim1$\ncm, with slightly flatter power-law size distributions than the ISM-like size\ndistribution ($p\\sim3.5$) found in the gaps. In particular, the inner ring\n($\\sim26$ au) is associated with a strong and narrow buildup of dust particles\nthat could harbor the necessary conditions to trigger the streaming\ninstability.

The two-dimensional atomic force microscope (AFM)\nline scanning of the deformation of the GO film after switching off the laser\nbeam takes by far too much time for any elastic changes to remain in the AFM\nscans. Thus, the changes in the GO film are irreversible and the optoelastic\nmodel used by Brevik is not applicable.

Using\nthe A-optimality criterion, i.e., the trace of the asymptotic variance, the\nresultant estimator is statistically efficient within a class of sampling\nestimators. We establish the unconditional asymptotic distribution of a general\nclass of response-free sampling estimators. This result is novel compared with\nthe existing conditional results obtained by conditioning on both covariates\nand responses. Under our unconditional framework, the subsamples are no longer\nindependent and new martingale techniques are developed for our asymptotic\ntheory. We further derive the A-optimal response-free sampling distribution.\nSince this distribution depends on population level quantities, we propose the\nOptimal Sampling Under Measurement Constraints (OSUMC) algorithm to approximate\nthe theoretical optimal sampling. Finally, we conduct an intensive empirical\nstudy to demonstrate the advantages of OSUMC algorithm over existing methods in\nboth statistical and computational perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 02:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 04:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 02:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

It consists of a base equipped with a servo motor, an\nindex finger part, and a thumb part, connected through three gears. The index\npart has a tri-axial load cell and an attached ring to measure the finger\nforce. An admittance control scheme was designed to provide intuitive control\nand positive force amplification to assist the user's finger movement. To\nevaluate the effects of different control parameters on neuromuscular re-sponse\nof the fingers, we created an integrated exoskeleton-hand musculo-skeletal\nmodel to virtually simulate and optimize the control loop. The exo-skeleton is\ncontrolled by a proportional derivative controller that computes the motor\ntorque to follow a desired joint angle of the index part, which is obtained\nfrom inverse kinematics of a virtual end-effector mass driven by the finger\nforce. We conducted parametric simulations of the exoskeleton in action, driven\nby the user's closing and opening finger motion, with different proportional\ngains, end-effector masses, and other coefficients. We com-pared the\ninteraction forces between the index finger and the ring in both passive and\nactive modes. The best performing assistive controller can re-duce the force\nfrom around 1.45N (in passive mode) to only around 0.52N, more than 64% of\nreduction. As a result, the muscle activations of the flex-ors and extensors\nwere reduced significantly.

The $PT$ symmetric\ntheory is not generally applicable for spin-1/2 fermions, since here $PT$ inner\nproduct vanishes due to Kramer's degeneracy. We consider a spin-1/2\nnon-Hermitian setup which acquires the combined $(PT)^2=+1$ symmetry, despite\n$T^2=-1$ and $P^2=+1$. The Hamiltonian inherits a non-Abelian adiabatic\ntransporter and the topological degeneracy via the combined evolution of the\n$\\psi(t)$ state and the $C(t)$ operator. The putative dynamical $C$ symmetry\ncan be a novel springboard for many other exotic quantum and topological\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 05:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 08:41:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 07:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

For instance, an\nunstable photon sphere is responsible for determining the size of a black hole\nshadow, while a stable photon sphere is inferred to cause the instability of\nspacetime due to the trapping of gravitational waves on the radius. A photon\nsurface is a geometrical structure first introduced by Claudel, Virbhadra and\nEllis as the generalization of a photon sphere. The surface does not require\nany symmetry of spacetime and has its second fundamental form pure-trace. In\nthis paper, we define the stability of null geodesics on a photon surface. It\nrepresents whether null geodesics perturbed from the photon surface are\nattracted to or repelled from the photon surface. Then, we define a strictly\n(un)stable photon surface as a photon surface on which all null geodesics are\n(un)stable. We find that the stability is determined by Riemann curvature.\nFurthermore, it is characterized by the normal derivative of the second\nfundamental form. As a consequence, for example, a strictly unstable photon\nsurface requires nonvanishing Weyl curvature on it if the null energy condition\nis satisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 05:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 03:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Specifically, the feature representation approach\nutilizes a feature hashing trick to encode the API call arguments associated\nwith the API name. The deep neural network architecture applies multiple\nGated-CNNs (convolutional neural networks) to transform the extracted features\nof each API call. The outputs are further processed through bidirectional LSTM\n(long-short term memory networks) to learn the sequential correlation among API\ncalls.

In order to perform efficient sampling of molecular systems, it is\nadvantageous to avoid extremely high energy configurations while also retaining\nthe ability to quickly generate new and independent trial states. Thus, we\nintroduce a continuous normalizing flow method which can quickly generate\nindependent states for various proposal distributions using a first-order\ndifferential equation. We define this continuous normalizing molecular flow\napproach based on two-body intermolecular interactions to achieve a probability\ndistribution transformation method which yields distributions which have\nprobability densities of zero when molecule pairs are in close proximity; while\nin all other cases, the probability density is compressed such that it is\nspatial uniform. This transform provides the proposal distribution which\ngenerates no states of extremely high energy. We find that an inverse square\nflow is applicable as the continuous normalizing molecular flow. Using the\ntransformed distribution, we can perform the Metropolis-Hastings method more\nefficiently. The high efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using\nsimple molecular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 06:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

In the category of separable Banach spaces with morphisms\nconsisting of linear isometries, such an example of (a universal) object is\nprovided by the well-known Banach Mazur theorem: the space C[0,1] of continuous\nfunctions on the unit interval contains each separable Banach spaces as a\nclosed subspace via a linear isometry. Here the question also arises if, as\nopposed to realising (separable) Banach spaces as spaces of continuous\nfunctions on [0, 1], it is possible to embed a Banach space as a subgroup of\nthe group of linear isometries (resp. unitaries) on a nice Banach (resp.\nHilbert) space. If such is the case, one says that the given Banach space is\nrepresentable as a group of isometries (resp. unitaries).\n  On the other hand, the idea of embeddability involves the possibility of\nrealising each object in a given class of objects as included inside another\nobject of the same class enjoying some good properties which are not present in\nthe initial object. Further, considering that a Banach space also comes\nequipped with weaker structures involving the underlying metric (Lipschitz),\nuniform and topological structures, it follows that besides the linear\nisomorphisms (isometries), one may also consider morphisms in this category\nconsisting of maps which are Lipschitz, uniformly continuous or continuous.\nThis motivates the consideration of situations where it becomes necessary to\nknow if a Banach space (resp a metric space) may be embedded in a nice Banach\nspace as a metric, uniform or merely as a topological space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

The gap increases with the size of the data\nsince only TigerGraph is able to scale to SF-1000---Neo4j finishes only 12 of\nthe 25 business intelligence queries in reasonable time. Nonetheless, Neo4j is\ngenerally faster at bulk loading graph data up to SF-100. A key to our study is\nthe active involvement of the vendors in the tuning of their platforms. In\norder to encourage reproducibility, we make all the code, scripts, and\nconfiguration parameters publicly available online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 09:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

As a result, high speed trains are widely deployed\naround the world. Providing more reliable and higher data rate communication\nservices for high speed trains has become one of the most urgent challenges.\nWith vast amounts of spectrum available, the millimeter wave (mmWave) system is\nable to provide transmission rates of several gigabits per second for high\nspeed trains. At the same time, mmWave communication also suffers from high\nattenuation, thus higher energy efficiency should be considered. This paper\nproposes an energy efficient power control scheme of train-ground mmWave\ncommunication for high speed trains. Considering a beam switching method for\nefficient beam alignment, we first establish position prediction model, the\nrealistic direction antenna model and receive power model. And then we allocate\nthe transmission power rationally through the power minimization algorithm\nwhile ensuring the total amount of transmission data. Based on this, this paper\nalso develops a hybrid optimization scheme and finds the limit of total energy\nconsumption when the number of segments goes to infinity. Through simulation\nwith various system parameters and taking velocity estimation error into\naccount, we demonstrate the superior performance of our schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 10:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

Its reaction rate must be accurately known in the present era of\nhigh precision astrophysics. The cross section of the reaction is often\nmeasured relative to a low energy resonance, the strength of which must\ntherefore be determined precisely. The activation method, based on the\nmeasurement of 15O decay, has not been used in modern measurements of the\n14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The aim of the present work is to provide strength\ndata for two resonances in the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction using the activation\nmethod. The obtained values are largely independent from previous data measured\nby in-beam gamma-spectroscopy and are free from some of their systematic\nuncertainties. Solid state TiN targets were irradiated with a proton beam\nprovided by the Tandetron accelerator of Atomki using a cyclic activation. The\ndecay of the produced 15O isotopes was measured by detecting the 511 keV\npositron annihilation gamma-rays. The strength of the Ep = 278 keV resonance\nwas measured to be 13.4 +- 0.8 meV while for the Ep = 1058 keV resonance the\nstrength is 442 +- 27 meV. The obtained Ep = 278 keV resonance strength is in\nfair agreement with the values recommended by two recent works. On the other\nhand, the Ep = 1058 keV resonance strength is about 20% higher than the\nprevious value. The discrepancy may be caused in part by a previously neglected\nfinite target thickness correction. As only the low energy resonance is used as\na normalization point for cross section measurements, the calculated\nastrophysical reaction rate of the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction and therefore the\nastrophysical consequences are not changed by the present results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 11:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Thus, Gilain and Siegmund-Schultze assume that references to limite in\nCauchy's work necessarily imply that Cauchy was working with an Archi-medean\ncontinuum, whereas infinitesimals were merely a convenient figure of speech,\nfor which Cauchy had in mind a complete justification in terms of Archimedean\nlimits.

We are able to place upper and lower limits on the size of the\nemitting region associated with a radio flare, and determine the synchrotron\nsource magnetic field and energy as a function of size. The energy has a clear\nminimum which occurs close to the condition that the magnetic field derived\nfrom synchrotron self absorption equals that calculated from equipartition.\nThis minimum energy estimate is independent of the rise time of the event, and\nso may be applied to any event for which the peak flux is measured and there is\nevidence for self-absorption. This is a much more accurate approach to minimum\nenergy estimation than assuming expansion at close to the speed of light. We\napply this method to four examples of optically thick radio flares and find\nthat in each case either the filling factor of the synchrotron source is\nconsiderably less than unity, or the expansion speed is considerably less than\nthe speed of light. The combination of unity filling factor and expansion\nspeeds close to the speed of light is completely ruled out on energetic grounds\nfor three of the four events we consider. The inferred slowed expansion is\nconsistent with detailed modelling of such events which has been recently\nreported in the literature. The minimum power requirements associated with the\nflares are found to be ~ 1e36 erg/s, which are easily accomodated in the\ncontext of stellar mass black hole accretion at near-Eddington levels, when\nthese flares typically occur.

Recent research has shown that the use of machine\nlearning for the fusion of multiple statistical algorithms improves outbreak\ndetection. Instead of relying only on the binary output (alarm or no alarm) of\nthe statistical algorithms, we propose to make use of their p-values for\ntraining a fusion classifier. In addition, we also show that adding additional\nfeatures and adapting the labeling of an epidemic period may further improve\nperformance. For comparison and evaluation, a new measure is introduced which\ncaptures the performance of an outbreak detection method with respect to a low\nrate of false alarms more precisely than previous works.

We evaluate an interference-limited\nnetwork composed of multiple remote radio heads that are allowed to cooperate,\nby keeping silence thus reducing interference, or by performing more elaborated\nstrategies such as maximal ratio transmission, in order to serve a user\nequipment with ultra-reliability. We provide extensive numerical analysis and\ndiscuss the gains of cooperation by the centralized radio access network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 12:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

Besides the development of individual EH devices, further\nissues are posed when considering multiple objects for realizing arrays of\ndevices and magnifying the extracted power. Due to nonlinear mutual\ninteractions, the resulting dynamics is generally different from that of single\ndevices and the setup optimisation turns out to be nontrivial. In this work, we\ninvestigate the problem focusing on a flutter-based EH system consisting of a\nrigid plate anchored by elastic elements and invested by a uniform laminar\nflow, undergoing regular limit-cycle oscillations and flapping motions of\nfinite amplitude. We consider a simplified, yet general, physical model and\nemploy three-dimensional direct numerical simulations based on a\nfinite-difference Navier-Stokes solver combined with a moving-least-squares\nimmersed boundary method. Focusing on main kinematic and performance-related\nquantities, we first report on the dynamics of the single device and then on\nmultiple devices. A parametric exploration is performed by varying the mutual\ndistance between the devices. For the in-line arrangement, a recovery in\nperformance for downstream devices is achieved by tuning their elasticity.\nMoreover, cooperative effects in the side-by-side arrangement are found to be\nsubstantially beneficial in terms of resulting power, with increases (i.e.\nconstructive interference) up to 100% with respect to the single-device\nconfiguration. In order to confirm this numerical evidence, complementary\nresults from wind-tunnel experiments are presented. Finally, we describe the\nsystem behaviour when increasing further the number of devices, outlining the\nultimate goal of developing a high-performance EH network of numerous\naeroelastic energy harvesters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 13:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

They\nhave a high dynamic range and temporal resolution of a microsecond, opposed to\nstandard cameras that output frames at fixed frame rates and suffer from motion\nblur. Forming stereo pairs of such cameras can open novel application\npossibilities, since for each event depth can be readily estimated; however, to\nfully exploit asynchronous nature of the sensor and avoid fixed time interval\nevent accumulation, stereo event lifetime estimation should be employed. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for event lifetime estimation of stereo\nevent-cameras, allowing generation of sharp gradient images of events that\nserve as input to disparity estimation methods. Since a single brightness\nchange triggers events in both event-camera sensors, we propose a method for\nsingle shot event lifetime and disparity estimation, with association via\nstereo matching. The proposed method is approximately twice as fast and more\naccurate than if lifetimes were estimated separately for each sensor and then\nstereo matched.

It\ndoes not require the knowledge of density of states and is therefore quite\nconvenient to compute in analyzing the spectrum of a general system. The\nWigner-surmise-like results for the ratio distribution are known for the\ninvariant classes of Gaussian random matrices. However, for the crossover\nensembles, which are useful in modeling systems with partially broken\nsymmetries, corresponding results have remained unavailable so far. In this\nwork, we derive exact results for the distribution and average of the ratio of\ntwo consecutive level spacings in the Gaussian orthogonal to unitary crossover\nensemble using a $3\\times 3$ random matrix model. This crossover is useful in\nmodeling time-reversal symmetry breaking in quantum chaotic systems. Although\nbased on a $3\\times 3$ matrix model, our results can also be applied in the\nstudy of large spectra, provided the symmetry-breaking parameter facilitating\nthe crossover is suitably scaled. We substantiate this claim by considering\nGaussian and Laguerre crossover ensembles comprising large matrices. Moreover,\nwe apply our result to investigate the violation of time-reversal invariance in\nthe quantum kicked rotor system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 14:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 16:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

For some\npurposes, it is enough to consider specific models of a type theory, but\nsometimes it is necessary to refer to the syntax, for example in proofs of\ncanonicity and normalisation. One option is to embed the syntax deeply, by\nusing inductive definitions in a proof assistant. However, in this case the\nhandling of definitional equalities becomes technically challenging.\nAlternatively, we can reuse conversion checking in the metatheory by shallowly\nembedding the object theory. In this paper, we consider the standard model of a\ntype theoretic object theory in Agda. This model has the property that all of\nits equalities hold definitionally, and we can use it as a shallow embedding by\nbuilding expressions from the components of this model. However, if we are to\nreason soundly about the syntax with this setup, we must ensure that\ndistinguishable syntactic constructs do not become provably equal when\nshallowly embedded. First, we prove that shallow embedding is injective up to\ndefinitional equality, by modelling the embedding as a syntactic translation\ntargeting the metatheory. Second, we use an implementation hiding trick to\ndisallow illegal propositional equality proofs and constructions which do not\ncome from the syntax.

Unlike in the case of two-flux CFs, the magnetic field\npositions of the geometric resonance resistance minima for $\\nu<1/4$ and\n$\\nu>1/4$ are symmetric with respect to the position of $\\nu=1/4$. However,\nwhen an in-plane magnetic field is applied, the minima positions become\nasymmetric, implying a mysterious asymmetry in the CF Fermi sea anisotropy for\n$\\nu<1/4$ and $\\nu>1/4$. This asymmetry, which is in stark contrast to the\ntwo-flux CFs, suggests that the four-flux CFs on the two sides of $\\nu=1/4$\nhave very different effective masses, possibly because of the proximity of the\nWigner crystal formation at small $\\nu$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 15:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 23:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Several attempts to address this tension through new physics rely\non extended models, featuring extra free parameters beyond the 6 $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters. However, marginalizing over extra parameters has the effect of\nbroadening the uncertainties on the inferred parameters, and it is often the\ncase that within these models the $H_0$ tension is addressed due to larger\nuncertainties rather than a genuine shift in the central value of $H_0$. What\nhappens if a physical theory is able to fix the extra parameters to a specific\nset of non-standard values? The degrees of freedom of the model are reduced\nwith respect to the standard case where the extra parameters are free to vary.\nFocusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of\nrelativistic species $N_{\\rm eff}$, I find that physical theories able to fix\n$w \\approx -1.3$ or $N_{\\rm eff} \\approx 3.95$ would lead to an estimate of\n$H_0$ from CMB, BAO, and SNeIa data in perfect agreement with the local\ndistance ladder estimate, without broadening its uncertainty.

However, implantation of the LVAD\nincreases the risk of stroke, infection, bleeding, and other serious adverse\nevents (AEs). Most post-LVAD AEs studies have focused on individual AEs in\nisolation, neglecting the possible interrelation, or causality between AEs.\nThis study is the first to conduct an exploratory analysis to discover common\nsequential chains of AEs following LVAD implantation that are correlated with\nimportant clinical outcomes. This analysis was derived from 58,575 recorded AEs\nfor 13,192 patients in International Registry for Mechanical Circulatory\nSupport (INTERMACS) who received a continuousflow LVAD between 2006 and 2015.\nThe pattern mining procedure involved three main steps: (1) creating a bank of\nAE sequences by converting the AEs for each patient into a single,\nchronologically sequenced record, (2) grouping patients with similar AE\nsequences using hierarchical clustering, and (3) extracting temporal chains of\nAEs for each group of patients using Markov modeling. The mined results\nindicate the existence of seven groups of sequential chains of AEs,\ncharacterized by common types of AEs that occurred in a unique order.

The\nadditional symbols are transmitted from the BS to CCU and CEU by utilizing\ndifferent modes of OAM. This paper investigates the ergodic sum capacity (ESC)\nof the proposed technique along with analytical derivations over Rician fading\nchannels. Finally, the performance in terms of ESC and energy efficiency over\nconventional technique compared to conventional multiple access is demonstrated\nby analysis and simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 05:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 01:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

To improve intraoperative registration, we develop two\ndeep learning approaches to localize the bronchoscope in the preoperative CT\nmap based on the bronchoscopic video in real-time, called AirwayNet and\nBifurcationNet. The networks are trained entirely on simulated images derived\nfrom the patient-specific CT. When evaluated on recorded bronchoscopy videos in\na phantom lung, AirwayNet outperforms other deep learning localization\nalgorithms with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.97.

In this study, we propose a fog computing\nbased framework to assist autonomous driving. Our framework relies on overhead\nviews from cameras and data streams from vehicle sensors to create a network of\ndistributed digital twins, called an edge twin, on fog machines. The edge twin\nwill be continuously updated with the locations of both autonomous and\nhuman-piloted vehicles on the road segments. The vehicle locations will be\nharvested from overhead cameras as well as location feeds from the vehicles\nthemselves. Although the edge twin can make fair road space allocations from a\nglobal viewpoint, there is a communication cost (delay) in reaching it from the\ncameras and vehicular sensors. To address this, we introduce a machine learning\nforecaster as a part of the edge twin which is responsible for predicting the\nfuture location of vehicles. Lastly, we introduce a box algorithm that will use\nthe forecasted values to create a hazard map for the road segment which would\nbe used by the framework to suggest safe manoeuvres for the autonomous vehicles\nsuch as lane changes and accelerations.
