The universities' internal organizational structures,\nhowever, still follow a traditional, decentralized scheme implementing an\nadditional organizational level -- the Chair -- effectively a \"mini department\"\nwith dedicated staff, budget and infrastructure. Although the Technical\nUniversity of Munich (TUM) has been establishing a more centralized scheme for\nmany administrative tasks over the past decade, the transition from its\ndistributed to a centralized information technology (IT) administration and\ninfrastructure is still an ongoing process. In case of the authors' chair, this\nmigration so far included handing over all network-related operations to the\njoint compute center, consolidating the Chair's legacy server system in terms\nof both hardware architectures and operating systems and, lately, moving\nselected services to replacements operated by Department or University. With\nrequirements, individuals and organizations constantly shifting, this process,\nhowever, is neither close to completion nor particularly unique to TUM. In this\npaper, we will thus share our experiences w.r.t. this IT migration as we\nbelieve both that many of the other German universities might be facing similar\nchallenges and that, in the future, North-American universities - currently not\nimplementing the chair layer and instead relying on a centralized IT\ninfrastructure - could need a more decentralized solution. Hoping that both\nbenefit from this journey, we thus present the design, commissioning and\nevolution of our infrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 17:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

Each user purchases the virtual capacity, and utilize it to reduce\nthe energy cost. We formulate the interaction between the aggregator and users\nas a two-stage optimization problem. In Stage 1, over the investment horizon,\nthe aggregator determines the investment and pricing decisions. In Stage 2, in\neach operational horizon, each user decides the virtual capacity to purchase\ntogether with the operation of the virtual storage. We characterize a stepwise\nform of the optimal solution of Stage-2 Problem and a piecewise linear\nstructure of the optimal profit of Stage-1 Problem, both with respect to the\nvirtual capacity price.

We confirm that\nwhile the cosmological acceleration is too small to leave a detectable imprint\non the gravitational waveforms observable by LISA, larger peculiar\naccelerations may be measurable for sufficiently long lived sources. We focus\non stellar mass black hole binaries, which will be detectable at low\nfrequencies by LISA and near coalescence by ground based detectors.

We explore the idea that an\napproximate 'angular' shift symmetry in field space (an isometry) protects the\ndynamics of coupled inflationary perturbations. This idea relates to the recent\nobservation that multi-field inflation mimics the predictions of single-field\ninflation, if the inflaton is efficiently and constantly coupled to a second\nmassless degree of freedom (the isocurvature perturbation). In multi-field\ninflation, the inflationary trajectory is in general not aligned with the\ngradient of the potential. As a corollary the potential does not reflect the\nsymmetries of perturbations. We propose a new method to reconstruct\nsimultaneously a two-field action and an inflationary trajectory which proceeds\nalong an `angular' direction of field space, with a constant radius of\ncurvature, and that has a controlled mass of `radial' isocurvature\nperturbations (entropy mass). We dub this `Orbital Inflation'. In this set-up\nthe Hubble parameter determines the behavior of both the background and the\nperturbations. First, Orbital Inflation provides a playground for quasi-single\nfield inflation. Second, the exquisite analytical control of these models\nallows us to exactly solve the phenomenology of Orbital Inflation with a small\nentropy mass and a small radius of curvature, a regime not previously explored.\nThe predictions are single-field-like, although the consistency relations are\nviolated. Moreover, the value of the entropy mass dictates how the inflationary\npredictions fan out in the ($n_s$, $r$) plane.

Here I show that\nthese patterns can be largely explained by detection biases. The \\emph{Kepler}\nplanet detections are set by the transit signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For\ndifferent stellar properties and orbital period values, the same S/N\ncorresponds to different planetary sizes. This variation in the detection\nthreshold naturally leads to apparent correlations in planet sizes and the\nobserved size ordering. The apparently correlated spacings, measured in period\nratios, between adjacent planet pairs in systems with at least three detected\nplanets are partially due to the arbitrary upper limit that the earlier study\nimposed on the period ratio, and partially due to the varying stability\nthreshold for different planets. After these detection biases are taken into\naccount, we do not find strong evidence for the so-called \"intra-system\nuniformity\" or the size ordering effect. Instead, the physical properties of\n\\emph{Kepler} planets are largely independent of the properties of their\nsiblings and the parent star. It is likely that the dynamical evolution has\nerased the memory of \\emph{Kepler} planets about their initial formation\nconditions.

Poloidal post-merger\nmagnetic field configurations produce jets with energies $E_\\mathrm{jet} \\sim\n(4{-}30)\\times10^{50}$ erg, isotropic equivalent energies\n$E_\\mathrm{iso}\\sim(4{-}20)\\times10^{52}$ erg, opening angles\n$\\theta_\\mathrm{jet}\\sim6{-}13^\\circ$, and durations $t_j\\lesssim1$ s.\nAccompanying the production of jets is the ejection of\n$f_\\mathrm{ej}\\sim30{-}40\\%$ of the post-merger disc mass, continuing out to\ntimes $> 1$ s. We discover that a more natural, purely toroidal post-merger\nmagnetic field geometry generates large-scale poloidal magnetic flux of\nalternating polarity and striped jets. The first stripe, of\n$E_\\mathrm{jet}\\simeq2\\times10^{48}\\,\\mathrm{erg}$, $E_\\mathrm{iso}\\sim10^{51}$\nerg, $\\theta_\\mathrm{jet}\\sim3.5{-}5^\\circ$, and $t_j\\sim0.1$ s, is followed by\n$\\gtrsim4$ s of striped jet activity with $f_\\mathrm{ej}\\simeq27\\%$. The\ndissipation of such stripes could power the short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) prompt\nemission. Our simulated jet energies and durations span the range of sGRBs. We\nfind that although the blue kilonova component is initially hidden from view by\nthe red component, it expands faster, outruns the red component, and becomes\nvisible to off-axis observers. In comparison to GW 170817/GRB 170817A, our\nsimulations under-predict the mass of the blue relative to red component by a\nfactor of few. Including the dynamical ejecta and neutrino absorption may\nreduce this tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The radio\nemission of such low-mass stars is poorly understood; few UCDs have been\ndetected at radio frequencies at all, and the likelihood of detection is only\nloosely correlated with stellar properties. Relative to other low-mass stars,\nUCDs with slow rotation such as TRAPPIST-1 tend to be radio dim, whereas\nrapidly rotating UCDs tend to have strong radio emission - although this is not\nalways the case. We present radio observations of TRAPPIST-1 using ALMA at 97.5\nGHz and the VLA at 44 GHz. TRAPPIST-1 was not detected at either frequency and\nwe place $3 \\sigma$ upper flux limits of 10.6 and 16.2 $\\mu$Jy, respectively.\nWe use our results to constrain the magnetic properties and possible outgoing\nhigh energy particle radiation from the star. The presence of radio emission\nfrom UCDs is indicative of a stellar environment that could pose a threat to\nlife on surrounding planets. Gyrosynchrotron emission, discernible at\nfrequencies between 20 and 100 GHz, is one of the only processes that can be\nused to infer the presence of high energy particles released during magnetic\nreconnection events. Since M dwarfs are frequent hosts of terrestrial planets,\ncharacterizing their stellar emission is a crucial part of assessing\nhabitability.

It has generally been presumed that the\nobjects in this class are binary star systems in which mass transfer leads to\nnuclear fusion on the surface of a white dwarf. Classical novae, the runaway\nfusion events on the surfaces of white dwarfs, generally have supersoft phases,\nand it is often stated that the bright steady supersoft X-ray sources seen from\nwhite dwarfs accreting mass at a high rate are undergoing steady nuclear\nfusion. In this letter, we report the discovery of a transient supersoft source\nin the Small Magellanic Cloud without any signature of nuclear fusion having\ntaken place. This discovery indicates that the X-ray emission probably comes\nfrom a \"spreading layer\" - a belt on the surface of the white dwarf near the\ninner edge of the accretion disk in which a large fraction of the total\naccretion energy is emitted - and (albeit more tentatively) that the accreting\nwhite dwarf is relatively massive. We thus establish that the presence of a\nsupersoft source cannot always be used as a tracer of nuclear fusion, in\ncontradiction with decades-old consensus about the nature of supersoft\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 20:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

Reinforcement learning optimizes policies to maximize the cumulative\nreward, whereas imitation learning attempts to extract general knowledge about\nthe trajectories demonstrated by experts, i.e., demonstrators. Because each of\nthem has their own drawbacks, methods combining them and compensating for each\nset of drawbacks have been explored thus far. However, many of the methods are\nheuristic and do not have a solid theoretical basis. In this paper, we present\na new theory for integrating reinforcement and imitation learning by extending\nthe probabilistic generative model framework for reinforcement learning, {\\it\nplan by inference}. We develop a new probabilistic graphical model for\nreinforcement learning with multiple types of rewards and a probabilistic\ngraphical model for Markov decision processes with multiple optimality\nemissions (pMDP-MO).

We adapt the generative adversarial imitation\nlearning and task-achievement reward to our proposed framework, achieving\nsignificantly better performance than agents trained with reinforcement\nlearning or imitation learning alone.

The Convolutional Neural Network (\\emph{CNN}) is one\nof the most widely used model family in the applications. Given the high\ncomputational complexity of the CNN models, it is favorable to execute them on\nthe integrated GPUs at the edge devices, which are ubiquitous and have more\npower and better energy efficiency than the accompanying CPUs. However,\nprogramming on integrated GPUs efficiently is challenging due to the variety of\ntheir architectures and programming interfaces.

In our model households are myopic boundedly rational heterogeneous\nagents embedded in a social network. From time to time each household updates\nits savings rate by copying the savings rate of its neighbor with the highest\nconsumption.

In\nthis regime households divide into two groups: Poor households with low savings\nrates and rich households with high savings rates.

These strategies range from sharing resources without\noutward signs of conflict to the development of dominance hierarchies, in which\ninitial fighting is followed by the submission of subordinates. Although models\nhave been developed to analyze specific strategies for resolving conflicts over\nresources, little work has focused on trying to understand why particular\nstrategies are more likely to arise in certain situations. In this paper, we\nuse a model based on an iterated Hawk--Dove game to analyze how resource\nholding potentials (RHPs) and other factors affect whether sharing, dominance\nrelationships, or other behaviours are evolutionarily stable. We find through\nextensive numerical simulations that sharing is stable only when the cost of\nfighting is low and the animals in a contest have similar RHPs, whereas\ndominance relationships are stable in most other situations. We also explore\nwhat happens when animals are unable to assess each other's RHPs without\nfighting, and we compare a range of strategies for this problem using\nsimulations. We find (1) that the most successful strategies involve a limited\nperiod of assessment followed by a stable relationship in which fights are\navoided and (2) that the duration of assessment depends both on the costliness\nof fighting and on the difference between the animals' RHPs.

Cache replacement policies are commonly used\nto improve the hit-rate of on-chip caches. The most effective replacement\npolicies often require the cache to track per-line reuse state to inform their\ndecision. A fundamental challenge on DRAM caches, however, is that stateful\npolicies would require significant bandwidth to maintain per-line DRAM cache\nstate. As such, DRAM cache replacement policies have primarily been stateless\npolicies, such as always-install or probabilistic bypass. Unfortunately, we\nfind that stateless policies are often too coarse-grain and become ineffective\nat the size and associativity of DRAM caches. Ideally, we want a replacement\npolicy that can obtain the hit-rate benefits of stateful replacement policies,\nbut keep the bandwidth-efficiency of stateless policies.\n  In our study, we find that tracking per-line reuse state can enable an\neffective replacement policy that can mitigate common thrashing patterns seen\nin gigascale caches. We propose a stateful replacement/bypass policy called\nRRIP Age-On-Bypass (RRIP-AOB), that tracks reuse state for high-reuse lines,\nprotects such lines by bypassing other lines, and Ages the state On cache\nBypass. Unfortunately, such a stateful technique requires significant bandwidth\nto update state. To this end, we propose Efficient Tracking of Reuse (ETR). ETR\nmakes state tracking efficient by accurately tracking the state of only one\nline from a region, and using the state of that line to guide the replacement\ndecisions for other lines in that region. ETR reduces the bandwidth for\ntracking replacement state by 70%, and makes stateful policies practical for\nDRAM caches. Our evaluations with a 2GB DRAM cache, show that our RRIP-AOB and\nETR techniques provide 18% speedup while needing less than 1KB of SRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 00:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

We\nfind that the $G$-only eigenvalue self-consistent $GW$ scheme with $W$ fixed to\nthe PBE level ($G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE), which gives the best compromise between\naccuracy and efficiency for solids, also gives good results for both localized\n($d$) and delocalized ($sp$) states of 3$d$-transition-metal oxide molecules.\nThe success of $G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE in predicting electronic excitations in these\nsystems reasonably well is likely due to the fortuitous cancellation effect\nbetween the overscreening of the Coulomb interaction by PBE and the\nunderscreening by the neglect of vertex corrections. Together with the absence\nof the self-consistent field convergence error (e.g. spin contamination in\nopen-shell systems) and the $GW$ multi-solution issue, the $G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE\nscheme gives the possibility to predict the electronic structure of complex\nreal systems (e.g. molecule-solid and $sp$-$d$ hybrid systems) accurately and\nefficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 01:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 01:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

It logically decouples\nthe current cellular networks into two entities; infrastructure providers\n(InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The resources of base\nstations (e.g., resource blocks, transmission power, antennas) which are owned\nby the InP are shared to multiple MVNOs who need resources for their mobile\nusers. Specifically, the physical resources of an InP are abstracted into\nmultiple isolated network slices, which are then allocated to MVNO's mobile\nusers. In this paper, two-level allocation problem in network slicing is\nexamined, whilst enabling efficient resource utilization, inter-slice isolation\n(i.e., no interference amongst slices), and intra-slice isolation (i.e., no\ninterference between users in the same slice). A generalized Kelly mechanism\n(GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource\nallocation issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed. The benefit of\nusing such a resource bidding and allocation framework is that the seller (InP)\ndoes not need to know the true valuation of the bidders (MVNOs). For solving\nthe lower level of resource allocation issue (i.e., between MVNOs and their\nmobile users), the optimal resource allocation is derived from each MVNO to its\nmobile users by using KKT conditions. Then, bandwidth resources are allocated\nto the users of MVNOs. Finally, the results of simulation are presented to\nverify the theoretical analysis of our proposed two-level resource allocation\nproblem in wireless network slicing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 01:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 08:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

As such, effective DRAM caching in\nfront of 3D-XPoint is important to enable a high-capacity, low-latency, and\nhigh-write-bandwidth memory. There are two major approaches for DRAM cache\ndesign: (1) a Tag-Inside-Cacheline (TIC) organization that optimizes for hits,\nby storing tag next to each line such that one access gets both tag and data,\nand (2) a Tag-Outside-Cacheline (TOC) organization that optimizes for misses,\nby storing tags from multiple data-lines together such that one tag-access gets\ninfo for several data-lines. Ideally, we desire the low hit-latency of TIC, and\nthe low miss-bandwidth of TOC. To this end, we propose TicToc, an organization\nthat provisions both TIC and TOC to get hit and miss benefits of both.\n  However, we find that naively combining both actually performs worse than\nTIC, because one needs to pay bandwidth to maintain both metadata. The main\ncontribution of this work is developing architectural techniques to reduce the\nbandwidth of maintaining both TIC and TOC metadata. We find the majority of the\nbandwidth cost is due to maintaining TOC dirty bits. We propose DRAM Cache\nDirtiness Bit, which carries DRAM cache dirty info to last-level caches, to\nprune repeated dirty-bit checks for known dirty lines. We then propose\nPreemptive Dirty Marking, which predicts which lines will be written and\nproactively marks dirty bit at install time, to amortize the initial dirty-bit\nupdate. Our evaluations on a 4GB DRAM cache with 3D-XPoint memory show that\nTicToc enables 10% speedup over baseline TIC, nearing 14% speedup possible with\nan idealized DRAM cache w/ 64MB of SRAM tags, while needing only 34KB SRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 01:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

The exoskeleton has 3 rotational\nDOFs on each side and weighs 23kg. Two torque compensation controllers of the\nexoskeleton are introduced, aiming to minimize interference and maximize\nassistance to human motions, respectively. Their effects on the wearer's\nbiomechanical loadings are studied with a running motion and predicted ground\nreaction forces. It is found that the added weight of the passive exoskeleton\nsubstantially increases the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings. The maximizing\nassistance controller reduces the knee joint torque by almost a half when\ncompared to the passive exoskeleton and the resultant torque is only 72% of\nthat from the normal running without exoskeleton. When compared to the normal\nrunning, this controller also reduces the hip flexion and extension torques by\n31% and 38%, respectively. As a result, the peak activations of the biceps\nshort head, gluteus maximus, and rectus femoris muscles are reduced by more\nthan a half. Nonetheless, the axial knee joint reaction force increases for all\nexoskeleton cases due to the added weight and higher GRFs.

A simple but costly way\nto do this is by aggregating the data to produce a table of keys and their\nfrequencies, apply our function to the frequency values, and then apply a\nweighted sampling scheme. Our main contribution is the design of composable\nsampling sketches that can be tailored to any concave sublinear function of the\nfrequencies. Our sketch structure size is very close to the desired sample size\nand our samples provide statistical guarantees on the estimation quality that\nare very close to that of an ideal sample of the same size computed over\naggregated data. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the simplicity and\neffectiveness of our methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 04:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 00:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 16:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Clumping is found to hasten the release of stored radiation,\nboosting the early time luminosity and shortening the photospheric phase.\nAround the photosphere, radiation leaks between the clumps where the photon\nmean free path is greater. Since radiation is stored uniformly in volume, a\ngreater clumping can increase this leakage by storing more and more mass into\nsmaller and denser clumps containing less and less radiation energy. An\ninhomogeneous medium in which different regions recombine at different\ntemperatures can also impact the light curve. Clumping can thus be a source of\ndiversity in SN brightness.

Conventional crack\ndetection algorithms focus on the design of single or multiple crack features\nand classifiers. However, complicated topological structures, varying degrees\nof damage and oil stains make the design of crack features difficult. In\naddition, the contextual information around a crack is not investigated\nextensively in the design process. Accordingly, these design features have\nlimited discriminative adaptability and cannot fuse effectively with the\nclassifiers. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning\nnetwork for pavement crack detection. Using the Encoder-Decoder structure,\ncrack characteristics with multiple contexts are automatically learned, and\nend-to-end crack detection is achieved. Specifically, we first propose the\nMulti-Dilation (MD) module, which can synthesize the crack features of multiple\ncontext sizes via dilated convolution with multiple rates. The crack MD\nfeatures obtained in this module can describe cracks of different widths and\ntopologies. Next, we propose the SE-Upsampling (SEU) module, which uses the\nSqueeze-and-Excitation learning operation to optimize the MD features. Finally,\nthe above two modules are integrated to develop the fast crack detection\nnetwork, namely, FPCNet. This network continuously optimizes the MD features\nstep-by-step to realize fast pixel-level crack detection. Experiments are\nconducted on challenging public CFD datasets and G45 crack datasets involving\nvarious crack types under different shooting conditions. The distinct\nperformance and speed improvements over all the datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art crack detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 06:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

Thus it is not clear whether the KPZ universality class is preserved\nin this case.

The fluid friction Reynolds number is\napproximately 900 over the bump, the highest achieved for similar computational\ndomains. A range of particle Stokes numbers are considered, each simulated with\nand without the lift force in the particle dynamic equation. When the lift\nforce is included a significant difference in the particle concentration, in\nthe order of thousands, is observed in comparison with cases where the lift\nforce is omitted. The greatest deviation is in regions of high vorticity,\nparticularly at the walls and in the shear layer but results show that the\nconcentration also changes in the bulk of the flow away from the walls. The\nparticle behaviour changes drastically when the Stokes number is varied. As the\nStokes number increases, particles bypass the recirculating region that is\nformed after the bump and their redistribution is mostly affected by the strong\nshear layer. Particles segregate at the walls and particularly accumulate in\nsecondary recirculating regions behind the bump. At higher Stokes numbers, the\nparticles create reflection layers of high concentration due to their inertia\nas they are diverted by the bump. The fluid flow is less influential and this\nenables the particles to enter the recirculating region by rebounding off walls\nand create a focus of high particle concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 08:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

While this study focuses on games and player experience as a\ntest domain, the findings and methodology are directly relevant to any\naffective computing area, introducing a general and user-agnostic approach for\nmodeling affect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 09:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 08:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

We have developed FDPS to\nmake it possible for many researchers to develop their own high-performance\nparallel particle-based simulation programs without spending large amount of\ntime for parallelization and performance tuning. The basic idea of FDPS is to\nprovide a high-performance implementation of parallel algorithms for\nparticle-based simulations in a \"generic\" form, so that researchers can define\ntheir own particle data structure and interparticle interaction functions and\nsupply them to FDPS. FDPS compiled with user-supplied data type and interaction\nfunction provides all necessary functions for parallelization, and using those\nfunctions researchers can write their programs as though they are writing\nsimple non-parallel program. It has been possible to use accelerators with\nFDPS, by writing the interaction function that uses the accelerator. However,\nthe efficiency was limited by the latency and bandwidth of communication\nbetween the CPU and the accelerator and also by the mismatch between the\navailable degree of parallelism of the interaction function and that of the\nhardware parallelism. We have modified the interface of user-provided\ninteraction function so that accelerators are more efficiently used. We also\nimplemented new techniques which reduce the amount of work on the side of CPU\nand amount of communication between CPU and accelerators.

In this study, we adopt such\nan RF approach and experimentally investigate its suitability as a biomarker\nfor demyelinating pathologies through direct comparison with histology. For\nthis, we use an in-vivo cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination with\navailable ex-vivo electron microscopy (EM) data. We test our model on\nnoise-free simulations and find very strong correlations between the predicted\nand ground truth parameters. For realistic noise levels as in our in-vivo data,\nthe performance is affected, however, the parameters are still well estimated.\nWe apply our RF model on in-vivo data from 8 CPZ and 8 wild-type (WT) mice and\nvalidate the RF estimates using histology. We find a strong correlation between\nthe in-vivo RF estimates of {\\tau}i and the EM measurements of myelin thickness\n({\\rho_\\tau}i = 0.82), and between RF estimates and EM measurements of\nintra-axonal volume fraction ({\\rho_f} = 0.98). When comparing {\\tau}i in CPZ\nand WT mice we find a statistically significant decrease in the corpus callosum\nof the CPZ compared to the WT mice, in line with our expectations that {\\tau}i\nis lower in regions where the myelin sheath is damaged. Overall, these results\ndemonstrate the suitability of machine learning compartment models with\npermeability as a potential biomarker for demyelinating pathologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 10:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

This contamination also leaks into smaller radial and angular modes\nto form a foreground wedge, further limiting the usefulness of 21-cm\nobservations for different science cases, especially cross-correlations with\ntracers that have wide kernels in the radial direction. In this paper, we\ninvestigate reconstructing these modes within a forward modeling framework.\nStarting with an initial density field, a suitable bias parameterization and\nnon-linear dynamics to model the observed 21-cm field, our reconstruction\nproceeds by combining the likelihood of a forward simulation to match the\nobservations (under given modeling error and a data noise model) with the\nGaussian prior on initial conditions and maximizing the obtained posterior.

Our method is applicable as a simple wrapper to the result of any\nclustering method minimizing the objective of $k$-means, which includes\nGaussian mixtures and Spectral Clustering. We focus in our experimental\nevaluation on an application for nonconvex clustering and demonstrate the\nsuitability of our theoretical results. Our \\textsc{SpecialK} clustering\nalgorithm automatically determines the appropriate value for $k$, without\nrequiring any data transformation or projection, and without assumptions on the\ndata distribution. Additionally, it is capable to decide that the data consists\nof only a single cluster, which many existing algorithms cannot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 11:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

To overcome the deficiency of linear correlation in practical\nmulti-view learning tasks, various CCA variants were proposed to capture\nnonlinear dependency. However, it is non-trivial to have an in-principle\nunderstanding of these variants due to their inherent restrictive assumption on\nthe data and latent code distributions. Although some works have studied\nprobabilistic interpretation for CCA, these models still require the explicit\nform of the distributions to achieve a tractable solution for the inference. In\nthis work, we study probabilistic interpretation for CCA based on implicit\ndistributions. We present Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) as a new\ncriterion for CCA to consider both linear and nonlinear dependency for\narbitrarily distributed data. To eliminate direct estimation for CMI, in which\nexplicit form of the distributions is still required, we derive an objective\nwhich can provide an estimation for CMI with efficient inference methods. To\nfacilitate Bayesian inference of multi-view analysis, we propose Adversarial\nCCA (ACCA), which achieves consistent encoding for multi-view data with the\nconsistent constraint imposed on the marginalization of the implicit\nposteriors. Such a model would achieve superiority in the alignment of the\nmulti-view data with implicit distributions. It is interesting to note that\nmost of the existing CCA variants can be connected with our proposed CCA model\nby assigning specific form for the posterior and likelihood distributions.\nExtensive experiments on nonlinear correlation analysis and cross-view\ngeneration on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nour model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 11:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

In the second stage, the\nmulti-scale gaze direction fields are concatenated with the image contents and\nfed into a heatmap pathway for heatmap regression.

These superior\nproperties highly depend on the shape and crystal phase of semiconductor NCs.\nSlight changes in the shape and phase of NCs can cause significant changes in\ntheir properties. Therefore, it is crucial to controllably synthesize\nsemiconductor NCs. Here, we demonstrate not only the synthesis of robust\nwell-defined ultrathin ZnS nanoplatelets (NPLs) with excitonic absorption and\nemission, but also the precise shape and phase control of ZnS NCs based on a\nsoft template strategy. The key feature of our approach is the tuning of the\nsulfur precursor amount, resulting in a simultaneous shape/phase transformation\nbetween wurtzite (WZ) ZnS NPLs and zinc blende (ZB) ZnS nanorods (NRs) at\nmoderate temperatures (150 degree). UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence\n(PL) spectra reveal very distinct optical properties between WZ-ZnS NPLs and\nZB-ZnS NRs. UV-vis absorption spectra of WZ-ZnS NPLs clearly exhibit a sharp\nexcitonic peak that is not observed in ZB-ZnS NRs. Besides, the PL\ncharacterization shows that WZ-ZnS NPLs have a narrow excitonic emission peak\n(292 nm), while the ZB-ZnS NRs exhibit a broad collective emission band\nconsisting of four emission peaks (335, 359, 395, and 468 nm). The appearance\nof excitonic features in the absorption spectra of ZnS NPLs is explained by\ninterband electronic transitions, which is simulated in the framework of\ndensity functional theory (DFT). The presented simple and effective synthetic\nstrategy opens a new path to synthesize further NCs with shape and phase\ncontrol for advanced applications in electronics and photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 12:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent g modes can\nperturb the frequencies of p modes.\n  Methods. We computed the first-order perturbation to global p-mode\nfrequencies due to a flow field and perturbations to solar structure caused by\na g mode. We focused on long-period g modes and assumed that the g-mode\nperturbations are constant in time. The surface amplitude of g modes is assumed\nto be $1$ mm s$^{-1}$, which is close to the observational limit.\n  Results. Gravity modes do perturb p-mode frequencies to first order if the\nharmonic degree of the g mode is even and if its azimuthal order is zero. The\neffect is extremely small. For dipole and quadrupole p modes, all frequency\nshifts are smaller than $0.1$ nHz, or $2\\times10^{-8}$ in relative numbers.\nThis is because the relative perturbation to solar structure quantities caused\nby a g mode of realistic amplitude is of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$.\nWe find that structural changes dominate over advection. Surprisingly, the\ninteraction of g and p modes takes place to a large part near the surface,\nwhere p modes spend most of their propagation times and g modes generate the\nlargest relative changes to solar structure.\n  Conclusions. It appears to be impossible to detect g modes solely through\ntheir signature in p-mode frequency shifts. Whether g modes leave a detectable\nsignature in p-mode travel times under a given observational setup remains an\nopen question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 12:55:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 07:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

To date and in the near\nfuture, gravitational wave measurements from neutron star binaries are likely\nto be restricted to the inspiral. However, future upgrades and the next\ngeneration of gravitational wave detectors will enable us to detect the\ngravitational wave signatures emitted after the merger of two stars, at times\nwhen densities beyond those in single neutron stars are reached. Therefore, the\npostmerger gravitational wave signal enables studies of supranuclear matter at\nits extreme limit. To support this line of research, we present new and updated\nphenomenological relations between the binary properties and characteristic\nfeatures of the postmerger evolution. Most notably, we derive an updated\nrelation connecting the mass-weighted tidal deformability and the maximum\nneutron star mass to the dominant emission frequency of the postmerger\nspectrum. With the help of a configuration-independent Bayesian analysis using\nsimplified Lorentzian model functions, we find that the main emission frequency\nof the postmerger remnant, for signal-to-noise ratios of $8$ and above, can be\nextracted within a 1-sigma uncertainty of about 100 Hz for Advanced LIGO and\nAdvanced Virgo's design sensitivities. In some cases, even a postmerger\nsignal-to-noise ratio of $4$ can be sufficient to determine the main emission\nfrequency. This will enable us to measure binary and equation-of-state\nproperties from the postmerger, to perform a consistency check between\ndifferent parts of the binary neutron star coalescence, and to put our physical\ninterpretation of neutron star mergers to the test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 14:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

To\nguarantee a safe and intuitive interaction between human and robot, human\nintentions need to be recognized automatically. As humans communicate their\nintentions multimodally, the use of multiple modalities for intention\nrecognition may not just increase the robustness against failure of individual\nmodalities but especially reduce the uncertainty about the intention to be\npredicted. This is desirable as particularly in direct interaction between\nrobots and potentially vulnerable humans a minimal uncertainty about the\nsituation as well as knowledge about this actual uncertainty is necessary.\nThus, in contrast to existing methods, in this work a new approach for\nmultimodal intention recognition is introduced that focuses on uncertainty\nreduction through classifier fusion. For the four considered modalities speech,\ngestures, gaze directions and scene objects individual intention classifiers\nare trained, all of which output a probability distribution over all possible\nintentions. By combining these output distributions using the Bayesian method\nIndependent Opinion Pool the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized\ncan be decreased. The approach is evaluated in a collaborative human-robot\ninteraction task with a 7-DoF robot arm. The results show that fused\nclassifiers which combine multiple modalities outperform the respective\nindividual base classifiers with respect to increased accuracy, robustness, and\nreduced uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 14:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

The Leave-One-Out (LOO) can lower the EPE\naround 2.50% but its variances are much higher than the any other CV procedure.\nThe computational time of our cross-validation procedure is just 8.64% of the\nMCCV, 8.67% of the stratified MCCV and 16.72% of the LOO. Experiments also show\nthat our approach is more beneficial for datasets characterized by relatively\nsmall size and large aspect ratio. This makes our approach particularly\npertinent when solving bioscience classification problems. Our proposed\nsystematic subsampling technique could be generalized to other machine learning\nalgorithms that involve random subsampling mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 14:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

A closely\nrelated nonlinear behavior to SRS is stimulated anti-Stokes Raman scattering\n(SARS). This nonlinear optical process combines the pump photon with the SRS\nphoton to generate an upconverted photon. Therefore, in order to achieve SARS,\nthe efficiency of the SRS process must be high.

Namely, with\nincreasing rotation rate, the BL signature suddenly changes from\nPrandtl--Blasius type to Ekman type. The transition from a constant heat\ntransfer to an almost linearly increasing heat transfer with increasing\nrotation rate is known to be sharp and the critical Rossby number $Ro_{c}$\noccurs typically in the range $2.3\\lesssim Ro_{c}\\lesssim 2.9$ (for Rayleigh\nnumber $Ra=1.3\\times 10^9$, $Pr=6.7$, and a convection cell with aspect ratio\n$\\Gamma=\\frac{D}{H}=1$, with $D$ the diameter and $H$ the height of the cell).\nThe explanation of the sharp transition in the heat transfer points to the\nchange in the dominant flow structure.

Whispering gallery mode resonators are\nparticularly attractive because of their small footprint as well as low\nthreshold and power consumption. This performance can be attributed to two\ncharacteristics: the cavity quality factor (Q) and the cavity dispersion. The\ninput optical field into the cavity is amplified by the cavity Q, enabling\nnonlinear processes to occur with low input powers. In addition, the total span\nof the optical comb is governed by the dispersion. In an optical cavity-based\ncomb, the dispersion is governed by the geometric dispersion of the cavity and\nthe material dispersion. While many different materials have been explored, the\nrealization of ultra-high Q (UHQ) on-chip frequency combs sources is still\nchallenging for most materials.

It is a notoriously difficult problem to solve numerically as\nsolutions have very steep temporal and spatial gradients. Adaptive moving mesh\nmethods ($r$-adaptive) attempt to optimise the accuracy obtained using a fixed\nnumber of nodes by moving them to regions of steep solution features. This\napproach on its own is however limited if the solution becomes more or less\ndifficult to resolve over the period of interest. Mesh refinement methods\n($h$-adaptive), where the mesh is locally coarsened or refined, is an\nalternative adaptive strategy which is popular for time-independent problems.\nIn this paper, we consider the effectiveness of a combined method\n($hr$-adaptive) to solve the NLSE in one space dimension. Simulations are\npresented indicating excellent solution accuracy compared to other moving mesh\napproaches. The method is also shown to control the spatial error based on the\nuser's input error tolerance. Evidence is also presented indicating\nsecond-order spatial convergence using a novel monitor function to generate the\nadaptive moving mesh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 15:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

We leverage a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) to extract both stationary and\nnon-stationary components of environmental acoustics and speech. We propose\nthree CNN architectures: (1) vanilla CNN that directly generates the enhanced\nsignal; (2) spectral-subtraction-style CNN (SS-CNN) that first predicts noise\nand then generates the enhanced signal by subtracting noise from the noisy\nsignal; (3) Wiener-style CNN (Wiener-CNN) that generates an optimal mask for\nsuppressing noise. An important problem of the proposed networks is that they\nintroduce considerable delays, which limits their real-time application for CI\nusers. To address this, this study also considers causal variations of these\nnetworks. Our experiments show that the proposed networks (both causal and\nnon-causal forms) achieve significant improvement over existing baseline\nsystems. We also found that causal Wiener-CNN outperforms other networks, and\nleads to the best overall envelope coefficient measure (ECM).

This loss of habitat\nhas skewed the population of several non-human primate species like chimpanzees\nand macaques and has constrained them to co-exist in close proximity of human\nsettlements, often leading to human-wildlife conflicts while competing for\nresources. For effective wildlife conservation and conflict management, regular\nmonitoring of population and of conflicted regions is necessary. However,\nexisting approaches like field visits for data collection and manual analysis\nby experts is resource intensive, tedious and time consuming, thus\nnecessitating an automated, non-invasive, more efficient alternative like image\nbased facial recognition. The challenge in individual identification arises due\nto unrelated factors like pose, lighting variations and occlusions due to the\nuncontrolled environments, that is further exacerbated by limited training\ndata. Inspired by human perception, we propose to learn representations that\nare robust to such nuisance factors and capture the notion of similarity over\nthe individual identity sub-manifolds. The proposed approach, Primate Face\nIdentification (PFID), achieves this by training the network to distinguish\nbetween positive and negative pairs of images. The PFID loss augments the\nstandard cross entropy loss with a pairwise loss to learn more discriminative\nand generalizable features, thus making it appropriate for other related\nidentification tasks like open-set, closed set and verification.

Advances of Deep learning makes it ideal to\nachieve those goals, however, its application is limited by the cost of high\nquality labels from patients data. Unsupervised learning, in particular, deep\ngenerative models with representation learning properties provides an\nalternative path to further understand cancer tissue phenotypes, capturing\ntissue morphologies. In this paper, we develop a framework which allows GANs to\ncapture key tissue features and uses these characteristics to give structure to\nits latent space. To this end, we trained our model on two different datasets,\nan H&E colorectal cancer tissue from the National Center for Tumor diseases\n(NCT) and an H&E breast cancer tissue from the Netherlands Cancer Institute\n(NKI) and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). Composed of 86 slide images and 576\nTMAs respectively. We show that our model generates high quality images, with a\nFID of 16.65 (breast cancer) and 32.05 (colorectal cancer). We further assess\nthe quality of the images with cancer tissue characteristics (e.g. count of\ncancer, lymphocytes, or stromal cells), using quantitative information to\ncalculate the FID and showing consistent performance of 9.86. Additionally, the\nlatent space of our model shows an interpretable structure and allows semantic\nvector operations that translate into tissue feature transformations.\nFurthermore, ratings from two expert pathologists found no significant\ndifference between our generated tissue images from real ones. The code,\nimages, and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Pathology-GAN\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 15:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 11:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 11:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 15:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 16:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

For this, we propose two simple and general\nmodels, based on the macroscopic quantum tunneling formalism (MQT). The first\nsetup is similar to the photon counter based on the \"cold electron bolometer\"\n(CEB), where the JJ replaces the CEB in the center of the superconducting\nantenna. In the second setup, the JJ is capacitively coupled to the antenna. We\nderive the Hamiltonians for the two setups and we write the Schr\\\"odinger\nequations taking into account both, the antenna and the JJ. The quantum\nparticles of the MQT models are in two-dimensional potential landscapes, which\nare parabolic along one direction and may have the form of a washboard\npotential along another direction. Such a potential landscape has a series of\nlocal minima, separated by saddle points. If the particle is prepared in the\ninitial state in the metastable \"ground state\" of a local minimum, then the\nphoton absorption causes it to jump into an excited state. If the excitation\nenergy is bigger than the potential barrier seen by the quantum particle (the\ndifference between the \"ground state\" and the saddle point), the photon is\ndetected.\n  The models are simple and allow us to do mostly analytical calculations. We\nshow that the two setups are equivalent form the MQT point of view, since one\nHamiltonian can be transformed into the other by changes of variables.

In order to\nsegment the image into meaningful connected components, this paper proposes an\nimage segmentation general framework using complex networks based community\ndetection algorithms. If we consider regions as communities, using community\ndetection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address\nthis problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an\ninitial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex\nnetwork. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous\ncommunities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed\nin order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of\nregions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and\nthen, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive\nsimilarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are\nconducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential\ncommunity detection algorithms are tested. Experimental results have shown that\nthe proposed general framework increases the segmentation performances compared\nto some existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 11:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}
