Then we\nsynthesize audio from features using WaveNet vocoder for subjective analysis.\nWe measure the quality of generated samples by objective measurements and\ncrowd-sourced human evaluations.

Based on these results, activation maximization can be used\nto start opening up the DNN black-box in speech tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 18:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

The structure of\nthe exhaust and associated turbulence is controlled by a pair of rotational\ndiscontinuities (RDs) at the exhaust boundary and a pair of slow shocks (SSs)\nthat are generated by counterstreaming ions beams. In 2D the exhaust develops\nlarge-amplitude striations at the ion Larmor radius scale that are produced by\nelectron-beam-driven ion cyclotron waves. The electron beams driving the\ninstability are injected into the exhaust from one of the RDs. However, in 3D\nRiemann simulations, the additional dimension (in the out-of-plane direction)\nresults in strong Buneman and electron-electron streaming instabilities at the\nRD which suppress electron beam formation and therefore the striations in the\nexhaust. The strength of the streaming instabilities at the RD are controlled\nby the ratio of the electron thermal speed to Alfv\\'en speed, lower thermal\nspeed being more unstable. In the 3D simulations an ion-ion streaming\ninstability acts to partially thermalize the counterstreaming ion beams at the\nSSs.

For many properties, it is\nknown that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain\nsize. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform\ndistribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\\ell_1$-distance\nuses only $O(\\sqrt{n})$ samples.\n  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise,\neven when the amount of noise is quite small. In this case, one must\ndistinguish if samples are coming from a distribution that is $\\epsilon$-close\nto uniform from the case where the distribution is $(1-\\epsilon)$-far from\nuniform. The latter task requires nearly linear in $n$ samples [Valiant 2008,\nValian and Valiant 2011].\n  In this work, we present a noise model that on one hand is more tractable for\nthe testing problem, and on the other hand represents a rich class of noise\nfamilies. In our model, the noisy distribution is a mixture of the original\ndistribution and noise, where the latter is known to the tester either\nexplicitly or via sample access; the form of the noise is also known a priori.\nFocusing on the identity and closeness testing problems leads to the following\nmixture testing question: Given samples of distributions $p, q_1,q_2$, can we\ntest if $p$ is a mixture of $q_1$ and $q_2$? We consider this general question\nin various scenarios that differ in terms of how the tester can access the\ndistributions, and show that indeed this problem is more tractable. Our results\nshow that the sample complexity of our testers are exactly the same as for the\nclassical non-mixture case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 21:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Our primary focus is\nedge-coloring arbitrary simple graphs using $d+1$ colors, where $d$ is the\nlargest vertex degree in the graph. Vizing's Theorem states that every simple\ngraph can be edge-colored using $d+1$ colors. Although some graphs can be\nedge-colored using only $d$ colors, it is NP-hard to recognize graphs of this\ntype [Holyer, 1981]. So using $d+1$ colors is a natural goal. Efficient\ntechniques for $(d+1)$-edge-coloring were developed by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv,\nLeven, and Terada in 1985, and independently by Arjomandi in 1982, leading to\nalgorithms that run in $O(|E| \\sqrt{|V| \\log |V|})$ time. They have remained\nthe fastest known algorithms for this task.\n  We improve the runtime to $O(|E| \\sqrt{|V|})$ with a small modification and\ncareful analysis. We then develop a randomized version of the algorithm that is\nmuch simpler to implement and has the same asymptotic runtime, with very high\nprobability.

Our experiments extract density ridges of Part I crime incidents from\nthe City of Chicago during the year 2018 and early 2019 to demonstrate the\napplication to current data.\n  Results: Our results demonstrate nonlinear mode-following ridges in agreement\nwith broader kernel density estimates.

The\ndepth-variant point spread function (PSF) of a fluorescence microscope produces\nlow-quality images especially in the out-of-focus regions of thick specimens.\nTraditional deconvolution to restore the out-of-focus images is usually\ninsufficient since a depth-invariant PSF is assumed. This article aims at\nhandling fluorescence microscopy images by learning-based depth-variant PSF and\nreducing artifacts. We propose adaptive weighting depth-variant deconvolution\n(AWDVD) with defocus level prediction convolutional neural network (DelpNet) to\nrestore the out-of-focus images. Depth-variant PSFs of image patches can be\nobtained by DelpNet and applied in the afterward deconvolution. AWDVD is\nadopted for a whole image which is patch-wise deconvolved and appropriately\ncropped before deconvolution. DelpNet achieves the accuracy of 98.2%, which\noutperforms the best-ever one using the same microscopy dataset. Image patches\nof 11 defocus levels after deconvolution are validated with maximum improvement\nin the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index of 6.6 dB and\n11%, respectively. The adaptive weighting of the patch-wise deconvolved image\ncan eliminate patch boundary artifacts and improve deconvolved image quality.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate depth-variant PSF and effectively\nrecover out-of-focus microscopy images.

The leading cause of skin cancer is high exposure of\nskin cells to UV radiation, which can damage the DNA inside skin cells leading\nto uncontrolled growth of skin cells. Skin cancer is primarily diagnosed\nvisually employing clinical screening, a biopsy, dermoscopic analysis, and\nhistopathological examination. It has been demonstrated that the dermoscopic\nanalysis in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists may cause a reduction in\ndiagnostic accuracy. Early detection and screening of skin cancer have the\npotential to reduce mortality and morbidity. Previous studies have shown Deep\nLearning ability to perform better than human experts in several visual\nrecognition tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient seven-way automated\nmulti-class skin cancer classification system having performance comparable\nwith expert dermatologists.

In this paper, we design a teacher-student learning\nframework to learn an occlusion-robust model from the full-body person domain\nto the occluded person domain. Notably, the teacher network only uses\nlarge-scale full-body person data to simulate the learning process of occluded\nperson re-id. Based on the teacher network, the student network then trains a\nbetter model by using inadequate real-world occluded person data. In order to\ntransfer more knowledge from the teacher network to the student network, we\nequip the proposed framework with a co-saliency network and a cross-domain\nsimulator. The co-saliency network extracts the backbone features, and two\nseparated collaborative branches are followed by the backbone. One branch is a\nclassification branch for identity recognition and the other is a co-saliency\nbranch for guiding the network to highlight meaningful parts without any manual\nannotation. The cross-domain simulator generates artificial occlusions on\nfull-body person data under a growing probability so that the teacher network\ncould train a cross-domain model by observing more and more occluded cases.\nExperiments on four occluded person re-id benchmarks show that our method\noutperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 08:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

A signed graph is an\nundirected graph where each edge is given a sign, positive or negative. An\nimportant concept for signed graphs is the operation of switching at a vertex,\nwhich is to change the sign of each incident edge. A homomorphism of a graph is\na vertex-mapping that preserves the adjacencies; in the case of signed graphs,\nwe also preserve the edge-signs. Special homomorphisms of signed graphs, called\ns-homomorphisms, have been studied. In an s-homomorphism, we allow, before the\nmapping, to perform any number of switchings on the source signed graph. This\nconcept has been extensively studied, and a full complexity classification\n(polynomial or NP-complete) for s-homomorphism to a fixed target signed graph\nhas recently been obtained. Such a dichotomy is not known when we restrict the\ninput graph to be planar (not even for non-signed graph homomorphisms).\n  We show that deciding whether a (non-signed) planar graph admits a\nhomomorphism to the square $C_t^2$ of a cycle with $t\\ge 6$, or to the circular\nclique $K_{4t/(2t-1)}$ with $t\\ge2$, are NP-complete problems. We use these\nresults to show that deciding whether a planar signed graph admits an\ns-homomorphism to an unbalanced even cycle is NP-complete. (A cycle is\nunbalanced if it has an odd number of negative edges). We deduce a complete\ncomplexity dichotomy for the planar s-homomorphism problem with any signed\ncycle as a target.\n  We also study further restrictions involving the maximum degree and the girth\nof the input signed graph.

Since the polaritonic\nwavefunctions in such systems are delocalized, our observations correspond to\nthe collective scattering of each photon from a large ensemble of molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 11:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

High redshift radio galaxies are among the most massive galaxies at\ntheir redshift, are often found at the center of protoclusters of galaxies, and\nare expected to evolve into the present day massive central cluster galaxies.\nThus they are a useful tool to explore structure formation in the young\nUniverse. Aims. 3C~294 is a powerful FR II type radio galaxy at z = 1.786. Past\nstudies have identified a clumpy structure, possibly indicative of a merging\nsystem, as well as tentative evidence that 3C~294 hosts a dual active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). Due to its proximity to a bright star, it has been subject to\nvarious adaptive optics imaging studies. Method. In order to distinguish\nbetween the various scenarios for 3C~294 we performed deep, high-resolution\nadaptive optics near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy of 3C~294 with\nthe Large Binocular Telescope. Results. We resolve the 3C~294 system into three\ndistinct components separated by a few tenths of an arcsecond on our images.\nOne is compact, the other two are extended, and all appear to be non-stellar.\nThe nature of each component is unclear. The two extended components could be a\ngalaxy with an internal absorption feature, a galaxy merger, or two galaxies at\ndifferent redshifts. We can now uniquely associate the radio source of 3C~294\nwith one of the extended components. Based on our spectroscopy, we determined a\nredshift of z = 1.784+-0.001, which is similar to the one previously cited. In\naddition we found a previously unreported emission line at $\\lambda$6749.4 \\AA\\\nin our spectra. It is not clear that it originates from 3C~294. It could be the\nNe [IV] doublet lambda 2424/2426 AA at z = 1.783, or belong to the compact\ncomponent at a redshift of z ~ 4.56. We thus cannot unambiguously determine\nwhether 3C~294 hosts a dual AGN or a projected pair of AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 13:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

To address this issue, we propose a simple but effective\nstrategy, that is, we propose a dual-discriminator (dual-D) adversarial\nlearning system, in which, a global-D is used to make an overall evaluation for\nthe synthetic image, and a local-D is proposed to densely evaluate the local\nregions of the synthetic image.

Haverford's long-standing \"3-2-1\" curriculum introduces code\nreasoning in conjunction with introductory programming concepts, and Grinnell's\ndiscrete mathematics introduces code reasoning as a motivation for logic and\nformal deduction.

To quantify this information\nin an agnostic way, we present a method to determine the amount of pathway\nassembly information contained within such an object by deconstructing the\nobject into its irreducible parts, and then evaluating the minimum number of\nsteps to reconstruct the object along any pathway. The mathematical\nformalisation of this approach uses an assembly space. By finding the minimal\nnumber of steps contained in the route by which the objects can be assembled\nwithin that space, we can compare how much information (I) is gained from\nknowing this pathway assembly index (PA) according to I_PA=log (|N|)/(|N_PA |)\nwhere, for an end product with PA=x, N is the set of objects possible that can\nbe created from the same irreducible parts within x steps regardless of PA, and\nNPA is the subset of those objects with the precise pathway assembly index\nPA=x. Applying this formalism to objects formed in 1D, 2D and 3D space allows\nus to identify objects in the world or wider Universe that have high assembly\nnumbers. We propose that objects with PA greater than a threshold are important\nbecause these are uniquely identifiable as those that must have been produced\nby biological or technological processes, rather than the assembly occurring\nvia unbiased random processes alone. We think this approach is needed to help\nidentify the new physical and chemical laws needed to understand what life is,\nby quantifying what life does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 18:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 22:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In order\nto further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information\nfunctions and chain rules, following, the computation of the cohomology in low\ndegrees is detailed to show more directly that the $k$ multivariate\nmutual-informations (I_k) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles condition\ncorresponds to I_k=0, generalizing statistical independence. Hence the\ncohomology quantifies the statistical dependences and the obstruction to\nfactorization. The topological approach allows to investigate information in\nthe multivariate case without the assumptions of independent identically\ndistributed variables and without mean field approximations. We develop the\ncomputationally tractable subcase of simplicial information cohomology\nrepresented by entropy H_k and information I_k landscapes and their respective\npaths. The I_1 component defines a self-internal energy U_k, and I_k,k>1\ncomponents define the contribution to a free energy G_k (the total correlation)\nof the k-body interactions. The set of information paths in simplicial\nstructures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes,\nprovides a trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The\nlocal minima of free-energy, related to conditional information negativity, and\nconditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy complex. This\ncomplex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a\ndefinition of a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local\nminima that quantifies the diversity observed in biology.

We\npreprocessed and geocoded the tweets, and then built a rule-based model that\nclassified each tweet into either promotional information or consumers'\ndiscussions. We applied topic modeling to discover major themes, and\nsubsequently explored the associations between the topics learned from\nconsumers' discussions and the responses of HPV-related questions in the Health\nInformation National Trends Survey (HINTS).\n  Results We collected 2,846,495 tweets and analyzed 335,681 geocoded tweets.\nThrough topic modeling, we identified 122 high-quality topics. The most\ndiscussed consumer topic is \"cervical cancer screening\"; while in promotional\ntweets, the most popular topic is to increase awareness of \"HPV causes cancer\".\n87 out of the 122 topics are correlated between promotional information and\nconsumers' discussions. Guided by IBM, we examined the alignment between our\nTwitter findings and the results obtained from HINTS. 35 topics can be mapped\nto HINTS questions by keywords, 112 topics can be mapped to IBM constructs, and\n45 topics have statistically significant correlations with HINTS responses in\nterms of geographic distributions.\n  Conclusion Not only mining Twitter to assess consumers' health behaviors can\nobtain results comparable to surveys but can yield additional insights via a\ntheory-driven approach.
