Epidemic models for large populations and finite populations on\nnetworks have been used to understand and control both transient and\nsteady-state behaviors. Typically it is assumed that after recovery from an\ninfection, every agent will either return to its original susceptible state or\nacquire full immunity to reinfection. We study the network SIRI\n(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected) model, an epidemic model for the\nspread of contagious processes on a network of heterogeneous agents that can\nadapt their susceptibility to reinfection. The model generalizes existing\nmodels to accommodate realistic conditions in which agents acquire partial or\ncompromised immunity after first exposure to an infection. We prove necessary\nand sufficient conditions on model parameters and network structure that\ndistinguish four dynamic regimes: infection-free, epidemic, endemic, and\nbistable. For the bistable regime, which is not accounted for in traditional\nmodels, we show how there can be a rapid resurgent epidemic after what looks\nlike convergence to an infection-free population. We use the model and its\npredictive capability to show how control strategies can be designed to\nmitigate problematic contagious behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 16:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 01:18:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 22:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 16:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Moreover, the reason behind\nthe shift of A2u mode to higher frequency for monolayer of both SnO and PbO is\nrevealed from our calculations. We also find that long-range Coulomb\ninteraction enhances the dielectric constant and Born effective charges in bulk\nSnO and bulk PbO, compared to their monolayer. Here, we observe avoided\ncrossing or Landau degeneracy between longitudinal acoustics (LA) and low\nenergetic transverse optical (TO) modes in bulk form of both SnO and PbO.\nAdditionally, monolayer SnO also shows low energetic Raman modes (Eg and A1g)\nof same frequency as bulk.

The enhanced force constants give rise\nto higher vibrational frequency of phonon modes for monolayer PbO.

Two dynamical schemes are examined: One is to characterize topological\nphases via quantum dynamics induced by a single quench along an arbitrary axis,\nand the other applies a sequence of quenches with respect to all (pseudo)spin\naxes. These two schemes are both built on the so-called dynamical bulk-surface\ncorrespondence, which shows that the $d$-dimensional ($d$D) topological phases\nwith integer invariants can be characterized by the dynamical topological\npattern emerging on $(d-1)$D band inversion surfaces (BISs). We show that the\nfirst dynamical scheme works for both deep and shallow quenches, the latter of\nwhich is initialized in an incompletely polarized trivial phase. For the second\nscheme, however, when the initial phase for the quench study varies from the\ndeep trivial (fully polarized) to shallow trivial (incompletely polarized)\nregime, a new dynamical topological transition, associated with topological\ncharges crossing BISs, is predicted in quench dynamics.

The correct output of the\nchip is produced, once the correct key value is available at the input of the\nkey-gates. The confidentiality of the key is imperative for the security of the\nlocked IP as it stands as the lone barrier against IP infringement. Therefore,\nthe logic locking is considered as a broken scheme once the key value is\nexposed. The research community has shown the vulnerability of the logic\nlocking techniques against different classes of attacks, such as Oracle-guided\nand physical attacks. Although several countermeasures have already been\nproposed against such attacks, none of them is simultaneously impeccable\nagainst Oracle-guided, Oracle-less, and physical attacks.

We show that the decision version of the deletion\nand editing problem to obtain RBMGs from vertex colored graphs is NP-hard.\nUsing known results for the so-called bicluster editing, we show that the RBMG\nediting problem for $2$-colored graphs is fixed-parameter tractable.\n  A restricted class of RBMGs appears in the context of orthology detection.\nThese are cographs with a specific type of vertex coloring known as\nhierarchical coloring.

The main physical infrastructure of\nthe AIT consists of an underground laboratory in the Boulby mine in Northern\nEngland.

By utilizing scanning\nnanothermometry, we visualize and investigate microscopic mechanisms\nundermining the apparent topological protection in the quantum Hall state in\ngraphene. Our simultaneous nanoscale thermal and scanning gate microscopy shows\nthat the dissipation is governed by crosstalk between counterpropagating pairs\nof downstream and upstream channels that appear at graphene boundaries because\nof edge reconstruction. Instead of local Joule heating, however, the\ndissipation mechanism comprises two distinct and spatially separated processes.\nThe work generating process that we image directly and which involves elastic\ntunneling of charge carriers between the quantum channels, determines the\ntransport properties but does not generate local heat. The independently\nvisualized heat and entropy generation process, in contrast, occurs nonlocally\nupon inelastic resonant scattering off single atomic defects at graphene edges,\nwhile not affecting the transport. Our findings offer a crucial insight into\nthe mechanisms concealing the true topological protection and suggest venues\nfor engineering more robust quantum states for device applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 13:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

Reliable information on the concentration, size\ndistribution and chemical characteristics of PMs is key to evaluating air\npollution and identifying its sources. Standard methods for PM2.5\ncharacterization require sample collection from the atmosphere and\npost-analysis using sophisticated equipment in a laboratory environment, and\nare normally very time-consuming. Although optical methods based on analysis of\nscattering of free-space laser beams or evanescent fields are in principle\nsuitable for real-time particle counting and sizing, lack of knowledge of the\nrefractive index in these methods not only leads to inevitable sizing ambiguity\nbut also prevents identification of the particle material.

It is the task of computationally\nidentifying the right sense of a polysemous word based on its context.\nResolving the WSD problem boosts the accuracy of many NLP focused algorithms\nsuch as text classification and machine translation. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new supervised algorithm for WSD, that is based on Kernel PCA and\nSemantic Diffusion Kernel, which is called Diffusion Kernel PCA (DKPCA). DKPCA\ngrasps the semantic similarities within terms, and it is based on PCA. These\nproperties enable us to perform feature extraction and dimension reduction\nguided by semantic similarities and within the algorithm. Our empirical results\non SensEval data demonstrate that DKPCA achieves higher or very close accuracy\nresults compared to SVM and KPCA with various well-known kernels when the\nlabeled data ratio is meager. Considering the scarcity of labeled data, whereas\nlarge quantities of unlabeled textual data are easily accessible, these are\nhighly encouraging first results to develop DKPCA further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Owing to increasing concerns about privacy, users (nodes) may prefer\nto keep some of their connections protected or private. Motivated by this\nobservation, our goal is to design a differentially private LP algorithm, which\ntrades off between privacy of the protected node-pairs and the link prediction\naccuracy. More specifically, we first propose a form of differential privacy on\ngraphs, which models the privacy loss only of those node-pairs which are marked\nas protected. Next, we develop DPLP , a learning to rank algorithm, which\napplies a monotone transform to base scores from a non-private LP system, and\nthen adds noise. DPLP is trained with a privacy induced ranking loss, which\noptimizes the ranking utility for a given maximum allowed level of privacy\nleakage of the protected node-pairs. Under a recently-introduced latent node\nembedding model, we present a formal trade-off between privacy and LP utility.\nExtensive experiments with several real-life graphs and several LP heuristics\nshow that DPLP can trade off between privacy and predictive performance more\neffectively than several alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 16:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 09:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}
