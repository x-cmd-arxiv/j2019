As the\ndriving force of crowdsourcing is the interaction among participants, various\nincentive mechanisms have been proposed to attract and retain a sufficient\nnumber of participants to provide a sustainable crowdsourcing service. However,\nthere exist some gaps between the modeled entities or markets in the existing\nworks and those in reality: 1) \\textit{dichotomous} task valuation and workers'\npunctuality, and 2) crowdsourcing service market \\textit{monopolized} by a\nplatform. To bridge those gaps of such impractical assumption, we model\nworkers' heterogeneous punctuality behavior and task depreciation over time.\nBased on those models, we propose an Expected Social Welfare Maximizing (ESWM)\nmechanism that aims to maximize the expected social welfare by attracting and\nretaining more participants in the long-term, i.e., multiple rounds of\ncrowdsourcing. In the evaluation, we modeled the continuous competition between\nthe ESWM and one of the existing works in both short-term and long-term\nscenarios. Simulation results show that the ESWM mechanism achieves higher\nexpected social welfare and platform utility than the benchmark by attracting\nand retaining more participants. Moreover, we prove that the ESWM mechanism\nachieves the desirable economic properties: individual rationality,\nbudget-balance, computational efficiency, and truthfulness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 16:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

In a\npartially ionised system, the fluids couple via collisions which occur at\ncharacteristic frequencies, therefore neutral and plasma species become\ndecoupled for sufficiently high-frequency dynamics.

The first is a regime\nwhere the neutral flow is decoupled from the magnetic field that is\ncharacterised with a constant heating rate, then at larger scales the strong\ncoupling approximation holds and the heating rate. At large scales with the KHi\nlayer width to the $-2$ power.

However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances\nwith well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups,\nmulti-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task\n(subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn\nmultiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even\nthough MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work\ninvestigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels.

For the\nsecond, we establish validity under analogous conditions on the expected\nsubsample size. For both procedures, we also establish conditions under which\nuniform validity holds. Furthermore, under appropriate sparsity conditions, we\nderive limiting distributions for the nonzero eigenvalues of the adjacency\nmatrix of a low rank sparse graphon. Our weak convergence result immediately\nyields the validity of subsampling for the nonzero eigenvalues under suitable\nassumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 17:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 23:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Such possible\ninteracting dark matter (IDM) model would imply a suppression of small-scale\nstructures due to a large collisional damping effect, even though the weakly\ninteracting massive particle (WIMP) can still be the DM candidate. Because of\nthis, IDM models can help alleviate alleged tensions between standard CDM\npredictions and observations at small mass scales. In this work, we investigate\nthe properties of DM halo substructure or subhalos formed in a high-resolution\ncosmological N-body simulation specifically run within these alternative\nmodels. We also run its CDM counterpart, which allowed us to compare subhalo\nproperties in both cosmologies. We show that, in the lower mass range covered\nby our simulation runs, both subhalo concentrations and abundances are\nsystematically lower in IDM compared to the CDM scenario. Yet, as in CDM, we\nfind that median IDM subhalo concentration values increase towards the\ninnermost regions of their hosts for same mass subhalos. Also similarly to CDM,\nwe find IDM subhalos to be more concentrated than field halos of the same mass.\nOur work has a direct application on studies aimed at the indirect detection of\nDM where subhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos\nsignificantly. From our results, we conclude that the role of halo substructure\nin DM searches will be less important in interacting scenarios than in CDM, but\nis nevertheless far from being negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 17:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 01:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

At the same time, some aspects of these states are\nexpected to be very different, e.g., their elementary excitations should have\neither Abelian (CF) or non-Abelian (Gaffnian) statistics. In this paper we\ninvestigate the close relationship between these two states by considering not\nonly their ground states, but also the low-energy charged excitations. We show\nthat the low-energy physics of both phases is spanned by the same type of\nquasielectrons of the neighbouring Laughlin phase. The main difference between\nthe two states arises due to an implicit assumption of short-range interaction\nin the CF approach, which causes a large splitting of the variational energies\nof the Gaffnian excitations. We thus propose that the Jain phase emerges as an\neffective Abelian low-energy description of the Gaffnian phase when the\nHamiltonian is dominated by two-body interactions of sufficiently short range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

The transverse and\nlongitudinal phonons of a crystal map onto the two gapless gauge modes of the\ntensor gauge theory, while the topological lattice defects map onto the gauge\ncharges, with disclinations corresponding to isolated fractons and dislocations\ncorresponding to dipoles of fractons.

We thereby derive a hybrid vector-tensor gauge\ntheory which describes a supersolid phase, hosting both crystalline and\nsuperfluid orders. The structure of this gauge theory puts constraints on the\nquantum phase diagram of bosons, and also leads to the concept of symmetry\nenriched fracton order.

In particular, both the compute time\nand memory usage have to be carefully taken into consideration due to the\ndimensionality of the neutron transport equations. In this paper, we study a\nmonolithic multilevel Schwarz preconditioner for the transport criticality\ncalculations based on a nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA) method.

To overcome these effects, we consider a\ndistributed cooperative beamforming system, which relies on static relays\ndeployed in clusters with similar channel characteristics, and where, at every\ntime instance, only one relay from each cluster is selected to participate in\nbeamforming to the destination. To meet the quality-of-service guarantees of\nthe network, a key prerequisite for beamforming is relay selection. However, as\nthe channels change with time, relay selection becomes a resource demanding\ntask. Indeed, estimation of channel state information for all candidate relays,\nessential for relay selection, is a process that takes up bandwidth, wastes\npower and introduces latency and interference in the network. We instead\npropose a unique, predictive scheme for resource efficient relay selection,\nwhich exploits the special propagation patterns of the mmWave medium, and can\nbe executed distributively across clusters, and in parallel to optimal\nbeamforming-based communication. The proposed predictive scheme efficiently\nexploits spatiotemporal channel correlations with current and past networkwide\nReceived Signal Strength (RSS), the latter being invariant to relay cluster\nsize, measured sequentially during the operation of the system. Our numerical\nresults confirm that our proposed relay selection strategy outperforms any\nrandomized selection policy that does not exploit channel correlations,\nwhereas, at the same time, it performs very close to an ideal scheme that uses\ncomplete, cluster size dependent RSS, and offers significant savings in terms\nof channel estimation overhead, providing substantially better network\nutilization, especially in dense topologies, typical in mmWave networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Following the detection of the first binary neutron star\nmerger in this run (LIGO/Virgo S190425z), we performed a dedicated follow-up\ncampaign with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Palomar Gattini-IR\ntelescopes. The initial skymap of this single-detector gravitational wave (GW)\ntrigger spanned most of the sky observable from Palomar Observatory. Covering\n8000 deg$^2$ of the initial skymap over the next two nights, corresponding to\n46\\% integrated probability, ZTF system achieved a depth of $\\approx$\\,21\n$m_\\textrm{AB}$ in $g$- and $r$-bands. Palomar Gattini-IR covered 2200 square\ndegrees in $J$-band to a depth of 15.5\\,mag, including 32\\% integrated\nprobability based on the initial sky map. The revised skymap issued the\nfollowing day reduced these numbers to 21\\% for the Zwicky Transient Facility\nand 19\\% for Palomar Gattini-IR. We narrowed 338,646 ZTF transient \"alerts\"\nover the first two nights of observations to 15 candidate counterparts. Two\ncandidates, ZTF19aarykkb and ZTF19aarzaod, were particularly compelling given\nthat their location, distance, and age were consistent with the GW event, and\ntheir early optical lightcurves were photometrically consistent with that of\nkilonovae. These two candidates were spectroscopically classified as young\ncore-collapse supernovae. The remaining candidates were ruled-out as\nsupernovae. Palomar Gattini-IR did not identify any viable candidates with\nmultiple detections only after merger time. We demonstrate that even with\nsingle-detector GW events localized to thousands of square degrees, systematic\nkilonova discovery is feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 12:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 07:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This creates batches of arrivals to the\nunderlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for\nthe batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a dangerous and deceptive\nstress on services, requiring a high amount of resources and exhibiting a\nfundamentally larger tail in those demands. This uncovers a service regime in\nwhich a system with large batch arrivals may have low utilization but will\nstill have non-trivial waiting. Methodologically, these staffing results follow\nfrom novel large batch and large batch-and-rate limits of the multi-server\nqueueing model. In the large batch limit, we establish the first formal\nconnection between general multi-server queues and storage processes, another\nfamily of stochastic models. By consequence, we show that the batch scaled\nqueue length process is not asymptotically normal, and that, in fact, the fluid\nand diffusion-type limits coincide. Hence, the (safety) staffing of this system\nmust be directly proportional to the batch size just to achieve a\nnon-degenerate probability of wait. In exhibition of the existence and insights\nof this large batch regime, we apply our results to data on Covid-19 contact\ntracing in New York City. In doing so, we identify significant benefits\nproduced by the tracing agency's decision to staff above national\nrecommendations, and we also demonstrate that there may have been an\nopportunity to further improve the operation by optimizing the arrival pattern\nin the public health data pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 15:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 19:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 03:04:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 19:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

For the proper\ncharacterization of the mmWave propagation channel, it is essential to measure\nthe power angular-delay profile (PADP) of the channel which includes\nangle-of-departure (AoD) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the multipath components\n(MPCs). In this paper, we first describe in detail our 28 GHz channel sounder\nwhere directional horn antennas are placed on rotating gimbals. Then, for this\nspecific sounder class, we describe and address the following two problems in\nextracting the MPCs from the measurements: 1) For the channel measurements at\nlarge distances between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX), it is not\npossible to generate the triggering signal for the TX and the RX using a single\nclock (SICL). This necessitates the use of separate clocks (SECLs) which\nintroduces a random timing drift between the clocks. 2) As the positions of the\nantennas change during the scanning process, total distance traveled by the\nsame MPC differs at each measurement. These two errors together cause missing\nsome of the MPCs and detecting MPCs that do not exist in reality. We propose an\nalgorithm to correct the clock drift and the errors in the MPC delays due to\nthe rotation of the antennas. We compare the MPCs from the SICL measurement and\nthe corrected SECL measurements using a Hungarian algorithm based MPC matching\nmethod. We show that the percentage of the matched MPCs increases from 28.36%\nto 74.13% after the correction process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 22:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

We seek to quantify the relative contributions of Lorentz force and\naerodynamic drag on their propagation. The CMEs are 3D reconstructed using the\nGraduated Cylindrical Shell(GCS) model to derive observed CME parameters.Using\na microphysical prescription of the drag coefficient,we find that solar wind\naerodynamic drag adequately accounts for the dynamics of the fastest CMEs from\nas low as 3.5 Rs. For relatively slower CMEs, however, we find that when the\ndrag-based model is initiated below the distances ranging from 12 to 50 Rs,the\nobserved CME trajectories cannot be accounted for.This suggests that\naerodynamic drag force dominates the dynamics of slower CMEs only above these\nheights.To investigate CME dynamics below the heights where aerodynamic drag\ndominates, we consider the Torus Instability model for the driving Lorentz\nforce. We find that for fast CMEs,Lorentz forces become negligible in\ncomparison to aerodynamic drag as early as 3.5-4 Rs.For slow CMEs, however,\nthey become negligible only by 12-50 Rs.This justifies the success of the\ndrag-only model for fast CMEs. In case of slow CMEs, the Lorentz force is only\nslightly smaller than the drag force even beyond 12-50 Rs.For these slow\nevents,our results suggest that some of the magnetic flux carried by CMEs might\nbe expended in expansion or heating. These dissipation effects might be\nimportant in describing the propagation of slower CMEs. To the best of our\nknowledge,this is the first systematic study in this regard using a diverse CME\nsample. A physical understanding of the forces that affect CME propagation and\nhow they compare with each other at various heliocentric distances is an\nimportant ingredient in building tools for describing and predicting CME\ntrajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 22:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

The shape of the\nvelocity pulse is determined basically by two free parameters: the velocity\n$V_0$ and the initial radial position $r_0$. In the present paper, models are\nconsidered in which the velocity $V_0$ takes the values 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50\ntimes the speed of sound of the clump $c_0$, while $r_0$ is fixed for all the\nmodels. The collapse of the model with $2 \\, c_0$ goes faster as a consequence\nof the velocity pulse, while the cluster formed in the central region of the\nisolated clump mainly stays the same. In the models with greater velocity\n$V_0$, the evolution of the isolated clump is significantly changed, so that a\ndense shell of gas forms around $r_0$ and moves radially inward. The radial\nprofile of the density and velocity as well as the mass contained in the dense\nshell of gas are calculated, and it is found that (i) the higher the velocity\n$V_0$, the less mass is contained in the shell; (ii) there is a critical\nvelocity of the pulse, around $10 \\, c_0$, such that for shock models with a\nlower velocity, there will be a well defined dense central region in the\nshocked clump surrounded by the shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Recent deep learning based methods depend on\nlearning global geometry from self-reconstruction. However, these methods are\nstill suffering from ineffective learning of local geometry, which\nsignificantly limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this\nissue, we propose MAP-VAE to enable the learning of global and local geometry\nby jointly leveraging global and local self-supervision. To enable effective\nlocal self-supervision, we introduce multi-angle analysis for point clouds. In\na multi-angle scenario, we first split a point cloud into a front half and a\nback half from each angle, and then, train MAP-VAE to learn to predict a back\nhalf sequence from the corresponding front half sequence. MAP-VAE performs this\nhalf-to-half prediction using RNN to simultaneously learn each local geometry\nand the spatial relationship among them. In addition, MAP-VAE also learns\nglobal geometry via self-reconstruction, where we employ a variational\nconstraint to facilitate novel shape generation. The outperforming results in\nfour shape analysis tasks show that MAP-VAE can learn more discriminative\nglobal or local features than the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 02:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

In the setting where latent covariate $X$\nis measured via multiple error-prone items $\\mathbf{W}$, PS analysis using\nseveral proxies for $X$ -- the $\\mathbf{W}$ items themselves, a summary score\n(mean/sum of the items), or the conventional factor score (cFS , i.e.,\npredicted value of $X$ based on the measurement model) -- often results in\nbiased estimation of the causal effect, because balancing the proxy (between\nexposure conditions) does not balance $X$. We propose an improved proxy: the\nconditional mean of $X$ given the combination of $\\mathbf{W}$, the observed\ncovariates $Z$, and exposure $A$, denoted $X_{WZA}$. The theoretical support,\nwhich applies whether $X$ is latent or not (but is unobserved), is that\nbalancing $X_{WZA}$ (e.g., via weighting or matching) implies balancing the\nmean of $X$. For a latent $X$, we estimate $X_{WZA}$ by the inclusive factor\nscore (iFS) -- predicted value of $X$ from a structural equation model that\ncaptures the joint distribution of $(X,\\mathbf{W},A)$ given $Z$. Simulation\nshows that PS analysis using the iFS substantially improves balance on the\nfirst five moments of $X$ and reduces bias in the estimated causal effect.\nHence, within the proxy variables approach, we recommend this proxy over\nexisting ones. We connect this proxy method to known results about\nweighting/matching functions (Lockwood & McCaffrey, 2016; McCaffrey, Lockwood,\n& Setodji, 2013).

Galaxy evolution and the effect of environment are most often\nstudied using scaling relations or some regression analyses around some given\nproperty. These approaches however do not take into account the complexity of\nthe physics of the galaxies and their diversification. Aims. We here\ninvestigate the effect of cluster environment on the evolution of galaxies\nthrough multivariate unsupervised classification and phylogenetic analyses\napplied to two relatively large samples from the WINGS survey, one of cluster\nmembers and one of field galaxies (2624 and 1476 objects respectively).\nMethods. These samples are the largest ones ever analysed with a phylogenetic\napproach in astrophysics. To be able to use the Maximum Parsimony (cladistics)\nmethod, we first performed a pre-clustering in 300 clusters with a hierarchical\nclustering technique, before applying it to these pre-clusters. All these\ncomputations used seven parameters: B-V, log(Re), nV , $\\mu$e , H$\\beta$ ,\nD4000 , log(M *). Results. We have obtained a tree for the combined samples and\ndo not find different evolutionary paths for cluster and field galaxies.\nHowever, the cluster galaxies seem to have accelerated evolution in the sense\nthey are statistically more diversified from a primitive common ancestor. The\nseparate analyses show a hint for a slightly more regular evolution of the\nvariables for the cluster galaxies, which may indicate they are more\nhomogeneous as compared to field galaxies in the sense that the groups of the\nlatter appear to have more specific properties. On the tree for the cluster\ngalaxies, there is a separate branch which gathers rejunevated or stripped-off\ngroups of galaxies. This branch is clearly visible on the colour-magnitude\ndiagram, going back from the red sequence towards the blue one. On this\ndiagram, the distribution and the evolutionary paths of galaxies are strikingly\ndifferent for the two samples. Globally, we do not find any dominant variable\nable to explain either the groups or the tree structures. Rather, co-evolution\nappears everywhere, and could depend itself on environment or mass.\nConclusions. This study is another demonstration that unsupervised machine\nlearning is able to go beyond the simple scaling relations by taking into\naccount several properties together. The phylogenetic approach is invaluable to\ntrace the evolutionary scenarii and project them onto any biavariate diagram\nwithout any a priori modelling. Our WINGS galaxies are all at low redshift, and\nwe now need to go to higher redshfits to find more primitve galaxies and\ncomplete the map of the evolutionary paths of present day galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 06:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

These\nresults suggest that grain boundaries (GBs) in CVD graphene, while impeding\ncharge transport, may have little effect on spin transport. However, to date\nvery little is known about the true impact of disordered networks of GBs on\nspin relaxation. Here, by using first-principles simulations, we derive an\neffective tight-binding model of graphene GBs in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), which we then use to evaluate spin transport in realistic\nmorphologies of polycrystalline graphene. The spin diffusion length is found to\nbe independent of the grain size, and is determined only by the strength of the\nsubstrate-induced SOC. This result is consistent with the D'yakonov-Perel'\nmechanism of spin relaxation in the diffusive regime, but we find that it also\nholds in the presence of quantum interference. These results clarify the role\nplayed by GBs and demonstrate that the average grain size does not dictate the\nupper limit for spin transport in CVD-grown graphene, a result of fundamental\nimportance for optimizing large-scale graphene-based spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 07:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 09:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

The PointHop method consists of\ntwo stages: 1) local-to-global attribute building through iterative one-hop\ninformation exchange, and 2) classification and ensembles. In the attribute\nbuilding stage, we address the problem of unordered point cloud data using a\nspace partitioning procedure and developing a robust descriptor that\ncharacterizes the relationship between a point and its one-hop neighbor in a\nPointHop unit. When we put multiple PointHop units in cascade, the attributes\nof a point will grow by taking its relationship with one-hop neighbor points\ninto account iteratively. Furthermore, to control the rapid dimension growth of\nthe attribute vector associated with a point, we use the Saab transform to\nreduce the attribute dimension in each PointHop unit.

Exploiting constraints derived from Hubble Space Telescope images and\nKeck longslit spectroscopy, our finding of apparent debris trails and\ndramatically enhanced star formation rates in an additional seven RPS\ncandidates support the hypothesis that RPS, and hence rapid galaxy evolution in\nhigh-density environments, is intricately linked to cluster collisions.\nUnexpectedly, we find the vast majority of RPS candidates in A1758N to be\nmoving toward us, and in a shared direction as projected on the plane of the\nsky.

Each image may contain multiple text sequences of\ndifferent content, location and orientation, and we try to recognize all the\ntext sequences contained in the image. 2) Pure end-to-end (PEE) learning.We\nsolve the problem in a pure end-to-end learning way where each training image\nis labeled by only text transcripts of all contained sequences, without any\ngeometric annotations. Most existing works recognize multiple text sequences\nfrom an image in a non-end-to-end (NEE) or quasi-end-to-end (QEE) way, in which\neach image is trained with both text transcripts and text locations.Only\nrecently, a PEE method was proposed to recognize text sequences from an image\nwhere the text sequence was split to several lines in the image.

We use statistical tests showing\nthat some pairs of clusters are indistinguishable from each other when chemical\nabundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) are\nused. However, for most clusters we are able to automatically assign membership\nwith metric scores similar to previous works. The confusion level of the\nautomatically selected clusters is consistent with statistical tests that\ndemonstrate the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing all the clusters from\neach other. These statistical tests and confusion levels establish a limit for\nthe prospect of blindly identifying stars born in the same cluster based solely\non chemical abundances. We find that some of the algorithms we explored are\ncapable of blindly identify stellar populations with similar ages and chemical\ndistributions in the APOGEE data. Because some stellar clusters are chemically\nindistinguishable, our study supports the notion of extending weak chemical\ntagging that involves families of clusters instead of individual clusters\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 09:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

A crucial concept in any Monte Carlo radiative transfer code is the\nrandom generation of the next interaction location. In polarised Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer with aligned non-spherical grains, the nature of dichroism\ncomplicates the concept of optical depth. Aims: We investigate in detail the\nrelation between optical depth and the optical properties and density of the\nattenuating medium in polarised Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes that take\ninto account dichroic extinction. Methods: Based on solutions for the radiative\ntransfer equation, we discuss the optical depth scale in polarised radiative\ntransfer with spheroidal grains. We compare the dichroic optical depth to the\nextinction and total optical depth scale. Results: In a dichroic medium, the\noptical depth is not equal to the usual extinction optical depth, nor to the\ntotal optical depth. For representative values of the optical properties of\ndust grains, the dichroic optical depth can differ from the extinction or total\noptical depth by several ten percent. A closed expression for the dichroic\noptical depth cannot be given, but it can be derived efficiently through an\nalgorithm that is based on the analytical result corresponding to elongated\ngrains with a uniform grain alignment. Conclusions: Optical depth is more\ncomplex in dichroic media than in systems without dichroic attenuation, and\nthis complexity needs to be considered when generating random free path lengths\nin Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. There is no benefit in using\napproximations instead of the dichroic optical depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 09:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

So, the system considered is $(Y,A,C)$, where\n$Y=(Y_t)$, is the marker process of interest, $A=A_t$ the treatment. A\nrealistic case is that the treatment can be changed only at discrete times. In\nan observational study the treatment attribution law is unknown; however, the\nphysical law can be estimated without knowing the treatment attribution law,\nprovided a well-specified model is available. An intervention is specified by\nthe treatment attribution law, which is thus known. Simple interventions will\nsimply randomize the attribution of the treatment; interventions that take into\naccount the past history will be called \"strategies\".

A general trend is that EAs are efficient if\nparameters like the mutation rate are set conservatively, but may need\nexponential time otherwise. In particular, it was known that the $(1+1)$-EA and\nthe $(1+\\lambda)$-EA can optimize every monotone function in pseudolinear time\nif the mutation rate is $c/n$ for some $c<1$, but they need exponential time\nfor some monotone functions for $c>2.2$. The second part of the statement was\nalso known for the $(\\mu+1)$-EA. In this paper we show that the first statement\ndoes not apply to the $(\\mu+1)$-EA. More precisely, we prove that for every\nconstant $c>0$ there is a constant integer $\\mu_0$ such that the $(\\mu+1)$-EA\nwith mutation rate $c/n$ and population size $\\mu_0\\le\\mu\\le n$ needs\nsuperpolynomial time to optimize some monotone functions. Thus, increasing the\npopulation size by just a constant has devastating effects on the performance.\nThis is in stark contrast to many other benchmark functions on which increasing\nthe population size either increases the performance significantly, or affects\nperformance mildly. The reason why larger populations are harmful lies in the\nfact that larger populations may temporarily decrease selective pressure on\nparts of the population. This allows unfavorable mutations to accumulate in\nsingle individuals and their descendants. If the population moves sufficiently\nfast through the search space, such unfavorable descendants can become\nancestors of future generations, and the bad mutations are preserved.\nRemarkably, this effect only occurs if the population renews itself\nsufficiently fast, which can only happen far away from the optimum. This is\ncounter-intuitive since usually optimization gets harder as we approach the\noptimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 10:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 19:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 14:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

The complex methods integrate two steps and\ncan be simultaneously tuned to achieve optimal performance, but these methods\nrequire a much larger amount of data for model training.

Some alloys that were supposed to have promising physical\nproperties could turn out to be much less useful because of their poor SS,\ne.g., the case for monolayer BNC [(BN)1-x(C2)x] alloys. Until now, an effective\napproach on significantly enhancing SS of (BN)1-x(C2)x in the entire x is still\nlacking. In this article, a novel mechanism of selective orbital coupling\nbetween high energy wrong-bond states and surface states mediated by the\nspecific substrate has been proposed to stabilize the wrong-bonds and in turn\nsignificantly enhance the SS of (BN)1-x(C2)x alloys.

Interestingly, the optical transitions\naround the band edges in these ordered alloys, accompanied by largely tunable\nexciton binding energies of ~1 eV at different x, are significantly strong due\nto their unique band structures. Importantly, the disordered (BN)1-x(C2)x\nalloys, exhibiting fully tunable bandgaps from 0 to ~6 eV in the entire x, can\nbe formed on Cr substrate at the miscibility temperature of ~1200 K, which is\ngreatly reduced compared to that of 4500~5600 K in free-standing form or on\nother substrates.

The literature is full of nonparametric methods to estimate a\nstatistic from just one available dataset through resampling techniques, e.g.,\njackknife, bootstrap and cross validation (CV). Special statistics of great\ninterest are the error rate and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of a\nclassification rule. The importance of these resampling methods stems from the\nfact that they require no knowledge about the probability distribution of the\ndata or the construction details of the ML algorithm. This chapter provides a\nconcise review of this literature to establish a coherent theoretical framework\nfor these methods that can estimate both the error rate (a one-sample\nstatistic) and the AUC (a two-sample statistic). The resampling methods are\nusually computationally expensive, because they rely on repeating the training\nand testing of a ML algorithm after each resampling iteration.

At high\nmultipoles, a better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and\ncorrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels\n(polarization efficiency or PE) allow us to fully use the polarization spectra,\nimproving the constraints on the $\\Lambda$CDM parameters by 20 to 30% compared\nto TT-only constraints.

Our Langevin\nsimulations for the special case where both exponentials contribute equally to\nthe total friction show that the barrier crossing time becomes independent of\nthe longer memory time if at least one of the two memory times is larger than\nthe intrinsic diffusion time. When we associate memory effects with coupled\ndegrees of freedom that are orthogonal to a one-dimensional reaction\ncoordinate, this counterintuitive result shows that the faster orthogonal\ndegrees of freedom dominate barrier-crossing kinetics in the non-Markovian\nlimit and that the slower orthogonal degrees become negligible, quite contrary\nto the standard time-scale separation assumption and with important\nconsequences for the proper setup of coarse-graining procedures in the\nnon-Markovian case. By asymptotic matching and symmetry arguments, we construct\na crossover formula for the barrier crossing time that is valid for general\nmulti-exponential memory kernels. This formula can be used to estimate\nbarrier-crossing times for general memory functions for high friction, i.e. in\nthe overdamped regime, as well as for low friction, i.e. in the inertial\nregime. Typical examples where our results are important include protein\nfolding in the high-friction limit and chemical reactions such as\nproton-transfer reactions in the low-friction limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 13:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Recently a write head design with\nflipped write and return poles was proposed. In this design a large spatial\nfield gradient of the write head was the key to significantly reduce the\ntransition curvature. In this work we optimized the write pole of a\nheat-assisted magnetic recording head in order to produce large field gradients\nas well as large fields in the region of the heat pulse. This is done by\ntopology optimization. The simulations are performed with dolfin-adjoint. For\nthe maximum field gradients of $8.1\\,$mT/nm, $8.6\\,$mT/nm and $11.8\\,$mT/nm,\nlocally resolved footprints of an FePt like hard magnetic recording medium are\ncomputed with a coarse-grained Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) model and the\nresulting transition curvature is analysed.

The results show that for both recording media, the optimized head\ndesign does not lead to any significant improvement of the written track. Thus,\nwe analyse the transition curvature for the optimized write heads theoretically\nwith an effective recording time window (ERTW) model. Moreover, we check how\nhigher field gradients influence the curvature reduction. The results show that\na simple optimization of the conventional head design design is not sufficient\nfor effective curvature reduction.

Motivated by the recent\nadvances of network dynamics, we proposed a framework based Lyapunov stability\nto analyze the dynamically induced cascading failures in complex networks.

Finally, we show\nthat this new model provides a better reproduction of visual illusions than the\noriginal Wilson-Cowan formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 15:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

In terms of behaviour, these springs closely\nmimic rods that serve as representations of Kuhn steps. We find that the\npredictions depend on the value of the repulsive parameter for bead-bead\npairwise interactions used in the DPD simulations ($a_{ij}$). For all systems,\nthe chain sizes and the relaxation time spectrum are analyzed. For $a_{ij} =\n0$, theta solvent behaviour is obtained for the chain size, whereas the\ndynamics at equilibrium agrees well with the predictions of the Zimm model. For\nhigher values of $a_{ij}$, the static properties of the chain show good solvent\nbehaviour. However, the scaling laws for the chain dynamics at equilibrium show\nwide variations, with consistent results obtained only at an intermediate value\nof $a_{ij} = 25$. At higher values of the repulsive parameter ($a_{ij} \\geq\n25$), our simulations are also able to predict the abrupt cut-off in the\nrelaxation spectrum, which has been observed earlier in experiments of dilute\nsolutions. The cut-off reached an extent that, for chain lengths of 10 Kuhn\nsteps, the spectrum consists of a single time scale. This agrees remarkably\nwell with earlier experiments and MD simulations. To verify further, we also\nstudied the chain dynamics in shear flow using DPD simulations. Specifically,\nwe analysed the variation of the chain stretch and end-over-end tumbling with\nshear rates.

The key contribution is a\ncontrol-theoretic regularizer for dynamics fitting rooted in the notion of\nstabilizability, a constraint which guarantees the existence of robust tracking\ncontrollers for arbitrary open-loop trajectories generated with the learned\nsystem. Leveraging tools from contraction theory and statistical learning in\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, we formulate stabilizable dynamics learning\nas a functional optimization with convex objective and bi-convex functional\nconstraints. Under a mild structural assumption and relaxation of the\nfunctional constraints to sampling-based constraints, we derive the optimal\nsolution with a modified Representer theorem. Finally, we utilize random matrix\nfeature approximations to reduce the dimensionality of the search parameters\nand formulate an iterative convex optimization algorithm that jointly fits the\ndynamics functions and searches for a certificate of stabilizability. We\nvalidate the proposed algorithm in simulation for a planar quadrotor, and on a\nquadrotor hardware testbed emulating planar dynamics. We verify, both in\nsimulation and on hardware, significantly improved trajectory generation and\ntracking performance with the control-theoretic regularized model over models\nlearned using traditional regression techniques, especially when learning from\nsmall supervised datasets. The results support the conjecture that the use of\nstabilizability constraints as a form of regularization can help prune the\nhypothesis space in a manner that is tailored to the downstream task of\ntrajectory generation and feedback control, resulting in models that are not\nonly dramatically better conditioned, but also data efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 21:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

Current NRSfM algorithms are\nlimited from two perspectives: (i) the number of images, and (ii) the type of\nshape variability they can handle. These difficulties stem from the inherent\nconflict between the condition of the system and the degrees of freedom needing\nto be modeled -- which has hampered its practical utility for many applications\nwithin vision. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical sparse coding\nmodel for NRSFM which can overcome (i) and (ii) to such an extent, that NRSFM\ncan be applied to problems in vision previously thought too ill posed. Our\napproach is realized in practice as the training of an unsupervised deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) auto-encoder with a unique architecture that is able to\ndisentangle pose from 3D structure. Using modern deep learning computational\nplatforms allows us to solve NRSfM problems at an unprecedented scale and shape\ncomplexity. Our approach has no 3D supervision, relying solely on 2D point\ncorrespondences. Further, our approach is also able to handle missing/occluded\n2D points without the need for matrix completion. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the impressive performance of our approach where we exhibit\nsuperior precision and robustness against all available state-of-the-art works\nin some instances by an order of magnitude.

Second, the framework provides heterogeneous privacy for\nusers depending on data's sensitive levels and servers' trust degrees. The\nchallenging issue is to keep the accumulation of privacy losses over ADMM\niterations minimal. In the proposed framework, a local randomization approach,\nwhich is differentially private, is adopted to provide users with\nself-controlled privacy guarantee for the most sensitive information. Further,\nthe ADMM algorithm is perturbed through a combined noise-adding method, which\nsimultaneously preserves privacy for users' less sensitive information and\nstrengthens the privacy protection of the most sensitive information. We\nprovide detailed analyses on the performance of the trained model according to\nits generalization error.

This problem\nsounds like a geometry problem, but it is likely to require techniques in\nnumber theory. That's because, to determine if the distance between (a,b) and\n(s,t) is rational, you need to test whether $(a-s)^2$ + $(b-t)^2$ is the square\nof a rational number...and such questions typically fall into the realm of\nnumber theory. Of course, since this is an open problem, no-one can claim to\nknow just what field the problem lies in, since no-one knows the solution. I\nbelieve it is not even known if there are more than 5 points on the parabola\nwhich satisfy the condition. It is certainly not known if there is an infinite\nfamily with pairwise rational distances. We can quickly see that there are\nthree such points in the following way: Pick two rational numbers, say 1/5 and\n3/5, and let those be the distances between the pairs of points AB and BC. If\nyou fix those distances and slide the points up the parabola, the distance AC\nwill gradually increase, bounded above by 4/5. Since the rational numbers are\ndense in the reals, there will be many placements of the points so that AC is a\nrational distance. It is not too hard to show that if you have N points on the\nparabola with rational distances between them, then you can find N points on\nthe parabola with integer distances between them.\n  This problem is publicly posted on the DIMACS mathematical research website\nin order to search for solutions. This paper demonstrates that an infinite\nnumber of families each containing an arbitrarily large number of such pairwise\nrational points on the parabola can be found. A constructive algorithm for\ndoing so is outlined in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 15:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}
