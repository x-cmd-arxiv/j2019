We here report\non the enhancement of the SNR of the optical spin read-out achieved by tuning\nthe mode of a two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC)cavity into resonance with\nthe NV-ZPL. PhC cavities are fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) milling in\nthin reactive ion (RIE) etched ultrapure single crystal diamond membranes\nfeaturing modes with Q-factors of up to 8250 at mode volumes below one cubic\nwavelength. NV centers are produced in the cavities in a controlled fashion by\na high resolution atomic force microscope (AFM) implantation technique. On\ncavity resonance we observe a lifetime shortening from 9.0ns to 8.0ns as well\nas an enhancement of the ZPL emission by almost one order of magnitude.\nAlthough on resonance the collection efficiency of ZPL photons and the\nspin-dependent fluorescence contrast are reduced, the SNR of the optical spin\nread-out is almost tripled for the cavity-coupled NV centers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 16:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

The results of the experiments have\nbeen compared to, and are in excellent quantitative agreement with, matter-wave\ninterference patterns calculated for the corresponding pulse sequences. For the\nRydberg states used, the spatial extent of the Rydberg electron wavefunction\nwas ~320 nm. Matter-wave interferometry with such giant atoms is of interest in\nthe exploration of the boundary between quantum and classical mechanics. The\nresults presented also open new possibilities for measurements of the\nacceleration of Rydberg positronium or antihydrogen atoms in the Earth's\ngravitational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 17:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

Photon spin plays an\nimportant role in various applications such as optical communications,\ninformation processing and sensing.

Interestingly, at certain interfaces, the surface waves decaying away\nfrom the interface possess a photon spin transverse to its propagation, opening\nexciting opportunities for observation of spin dependent unidirectional\nexcitation in confined systems. Here we propose and realize transverse photon\nspin (T-spin) in the interior of a bulk medium, without relying on the presence\nof any interfaces. We show the complete mapping of the T-spin of surface modes\nto that of the bulk modes by introducing the coupling between electric and\nmagnetic responses along orthogonal directions, i.e., the bianisotropy, into\nthe medium.

Non-rotating metal-rich stars also reveal\nthe products of nucleosynthesis on their surfaces because even modest amounts\nof mass loss expose their \"fossil\" convective cores: regions that are no longer\nconvective, but which were part of the convective core at an early stage in the\nstar's evolution. Thus surface enhancement of He and N is expected for rotating\nstars at all metallicities, and for non-rotating stars if they are relatively\nmetal-rich. We calculate a stellar atmosphere for a representative model from\nour grid, properly accounting for He- and N-enhancement, and show that the\nresulting spectrum provides a good match to observed WNL stars, strongly\nsuggesting that the physical mechanisms we have identified are the ultimate\ncause of the WNL phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 17:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 23:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

In this study, we\nperform a fuzzy-based analysis of vector representations of words, i.e., word\nembeddings. We use two popular fuzzy clustering algorithms on count-based word\nembeddings, known as GloVe, of different dimensionality.

The results indicate that fuzzy clustering algorithms are very\nsensitive to high-dimensional data, and parameter tuning can dramatically\nchange their performance.

A data mining approach with machine learning methods is used\nto estimate a price range based on the profile characteristics of 3D printing\nservice suppliers. The model considers factors such as supplier experience,\nsupplier capabilities, customer reviews and ratings from past orders, and scale\nof operations among others to estimate a price range for suppliers' services.\nData was gathered from existing marketplace websites, which was then used to\ntrain and test the model.

Widely regarded as the \"textbook example\" of a cluster\nmerger bow shock, the western shock front in the Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56)\nrepresents the ideal test case for such an SZ study. We aim to reconstruct a\nparametric model for the shock SZ signal by directly and jointly fitting deep,\nhigh-resolution interferometric data from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in\nFourier space. The ALMA+ACA data are primarily sensitive to the electron\npressure difference across the shock front. To estimate the shock Mach number\n$M$, this difference can be combined with the value for the upstream electron\npressure derived from an independent Chandra X-ray analysis. In the case of\ninstantaneous electron-ion temperature equilibration, we find\n$M=2.08^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, in $\\approx 2.4\\sigma$ tension with the independent\nconstraint from Chandra, $M_X=2.74\\pm0.25$. The assumption of purely adiabatic\nelectron temperature change across the shock leads to $M=2.53^{+0.33}_{-0.25}$,\nin better agreement with the X-ray estimate $M_X=2.57\\pm0.23$ derived for the\nsame heating scenario. We have demonstrated that interferometric observations\nof the SZ effect provide constraints on the properties of the shock in the\nBullet Cluster that are highly complementary to X-ray observations. The\ncombination of X-ray and SZ data yields a powerful probe of the shock\nproperties, capable of measuring $M$ and addressing the question of\nelectron-ion equilibration in cluster shocks. Our analysis is however limited\nby systematics related to the overall cluster geometry and the complexity of\nthe post-shock gas distribution. To overcome these limitations, a joint\nanalysis of SZ and X-ray data is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 18:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

The cosmological\nconstant and weak hierarchy problems, as well as the metastability of the\nelectroweak vacuum, can all be understood as problems of criticality. This\nsuggests a statistical physics approach, based on the string landscape. We\npresent a dynamical selection mechanism for hospitable vacua based on search\noptimization. Instead of focusing on stationary probability distributions, we\nare interested in the approach to equilibrium. This is particularly relevant if\ncosmological evolution has occurred for a time shorter than the\nexponentially-long mixing time for the landscape. This imposes a strong\nselection pressure among hospitable vacua, favoring those in regions where the\nsearch algorithm is efficient. Specifically, the mean first passage time is\nminimized for hospitable vacua lying at the bottom of funnel-like regions, akin\nto the smooth folding funnels of proteins and the loss functions of\nwell-trained deep neural networks. The optimality criterion is\ntime-reparametrization invariant and defined by two competing requirements:\nsearch efficiency, which requires minimizing the mean first passage time, and\nsweeping exploration, which requires that random walks are recurrent. Optimal\nlandscape regions reach a compromise by lying at the critical boundary between\nrecurrence and transience, thereby achieving dynamical criticality. Remarkably,\nthis implies that the optimal lifetime of vacua coincides with the de Sitter\nPage time. Our mechanism makes concrete phenomenological predictions: 1. The\nexpected lifetime of our universe is $10^{130}$ years, which is ~$2\\sigma$ from\nthe Standard Model metastability estimate; 2. The SUSY breaking scale should be\nhigh, $>10^{10}$ GeV. The present framework suggests a correspondence between\nthe near-criticality of our universe and non-equilibrium critical phenomena on\nthe landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 05:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Synchrotron self-absorption\n(SSA) has often been identified as the cause of their spectral peak. The\nidentification of new megahertz-peaked spectrum sources from the GaLactic and\nExtragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey provides an\nopportunity to test how radio sources with spectral peaks below 1 GHz fit\nwithin this evolutionary picture. We observed six peaked-spectrum sources\nselected from the GLEAM survey, three that have spectral characteristics which\nviolate SSA and three that have spectral peaks below 230 MHz, with the Very\nLong Baseline Array at 1.55 and 4.96 GHz. We present milliarcsecond resolution\nimages of each source and constrain their morphology, linear size, luminosity,\nand magnetic field strength. Of the sources that are resolved by our study, the\nsources that violate SSA appear to be compact doubles, while the sources with\npeak frequencies below 230 MHz have core-jet features. We find that all of our\nsources are smaller than expected from SSA by factors of >20. We also find that\ncomponent magnetic field strengths calculated from SSA are likely inaccurate,\ndiffering by factors of >5 from equipartition estimates. The calculated\nequipartition magnetic field strengths more closely resemble estimates from\npreviously studied gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. Exploring a model of the\ninteraction between jets and the interstellar medium, we demonstrate that\nfree-free absorption (FFA) can accurately describe the linear sizes and peak\nfrequencies of our sources. Our findings support the theory that there is a\nfraction of peaked-spectrum sources whose spectral peaks are best modelled by\nFFA, implying our understanding of the early stages of radio AGN is incomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

This arises in applications\nsuch as sensor network localization, multiview registration, and protein\nstructure determination. The least-squares estimator for this problem can be\nreduced to a rank-constrained semidefinite program (REG-SDP). It was recently\nshown that by formally applying the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM), we can derive an iterative solver (REG-ADMM) for REG-SDP, wherein each\nsubproblem admits a simple closed-form solution. The empirical success of\nREG-ADMM has been demonstrated for multiview registration. However, its\nconvergence does not follow from the existing literature on nonconvex ADMM. In\nthis work, we study the convergence of REG-ADMM and our main findings are as\nfollows. We prove that any fixed point of REG-ADMM is a stationary (KKT) point\nof REG-SDP. Moreover, for clean measurements, we give an explicit formula for\nthe ADMM parameter $\\rho$, for which REG-ADMM is guaranteed to converge to the\nglobal optimum (with arbitrary initialization). If the noise is low, we can\nstill show that the iterates converge to the global optimum, provided they are\ninitialized sufficiently close to the optimum. On the other hand, if the noise\nis high, we explain why REG-ADMM becomes unstable if $\\rho$ is less than some\nthreshold, irrespective of the initialization. We present simulation results to\nsupport our theoretical predictions. The novelty of our analysis lies in the\nfact that we exploit the notion of tightness of convex relaxation to arrive at\nour convergence results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

In this work, a\nnon-linear combustion phasing model is developed and integrated with a\ncylinder-specific model of intake gas. The combustion phasing model uses a\nknock integral model, a burn duration model and a Wiebe function to predict\nCA50 (the crank angle at which 50% of the mass of fuel has burned). Meanwhile,\nthe intake gas property model predicts the EGR fraction and the in-cylinder\npressure and temperature at intake valve closing (IVC) for different cylinders.\nAs such, cylinder-to-cylinder variation of the pressure and temperature at\nintake valves closing is also considered in this model. This combined model is\nsimplified for controller design and validated. Based on these models, two\ncombustion phasing control strategies are explored. The first is an adaptive\ncontroller that is designed for closed-loop control and the second is a\nfeedforward model-based control strategy for open-loop control. These two\ncontrol approaches were tested in simulations for all six cylinders and the\nresults demonstrate that the CA50 can reach steady state conditions within 10\ncycles. In addition, the steady state errors are less than +/-0.1 crank angle\ndegree (CAD) with the adaptive control approach, and less than +/-1.3 CAD with\nfeedforward model-based control.

Motion prediction is one of the core functions of an autonomous\ndriving car. Previously, we propose a novel scheme called GRIP which is\ndesigned to predict trajectories for traffic agents around an autonomous car\nefficiently. GRIP uses a graph to represent the interactions of close objects,\napplies several graph convolutional blocks to extract features, and\nsubsequently uses an encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) model to\nmake predictions. Even though our experimental results show that GRIP improves\nthe prediction accuracy of the state-of-the-art solution by 30%, GRIP still has\nsome limitations. GRIP uses a fixed graph to describe the relationships between\ndifferent traffic agents and hence may suffer some performance degradations\nwhen it is being used in urban traffic scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we\ndescribe an improved scheme called GRIP++ where we use both fixed and dynamic\ngraphs for trajectory predictions of different types of traffic agents. Such an\nimprovement can help autonomous driving cars avoid many traffic accidents.

Extending\nprevious sparse regression approaches for inferring PDE models from simulated\ndata, we address key issues that have thus far limited the application of these\nmethods to noisy experimental data, namely their robustness against noise and\nthe need for manual parameter tuning. We address both points by proposing a\nstability-based model selection scheme to determine the level of regularization\nrequired for reproducible recovery of the underlying PDE. This avoids manual\nparameter tuning and provides a principled way to improve the method's\nrobustness against noise in the data. Our stability selection approach, termed\nPDE-STRIDE, can be combined with any sparsity-promoting penalized regression\nmodel and provides an interpretable criterion for model component importance.\nWe show that in particular the combination of stability selection with the\niterative hard-thresholding algorithm from compressed sensing provides a fast,\nparameter-free, and robust computational framework for PDE inference that\noutperforms previous algorithmic approaches with respect to recovery accuracy,\namount of data required, and robustness to noise.

This paper surveys the relevant literature, explains\nsome of the methods used to generate the table, presents some new putatively\noptimal packings, and invites the reader to competitively contribute\nimprovements to this table.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 02:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

The geometric convergence of these methods is ensured for conservatively\nselected step sizes, but how to choose an appropriate step size while running\nthe algorithms has not been fully addressed. The Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method\nis a simple and effective technique for step sizes and requires few storage and\ninexpensive computations. It has been widely applied in various areas.

Furthermore, conventional feature\nextraction algorithms are not designed to generate useful intermediary signals\nwhich are valuable only in the context of neuromorphic hardware limitations. In\nthis work a novel event-based feature extraction method is proposed that\nfocuses on these issues. The algorithm operates via simple adaptive selection\nthresholds which allow a simpler implementation of network homeostasis than\nprevious works by trading off a small amount of information loss in the form of\nmissed events that fall outside the selection thresholds. The behavior of the\nselection thresholds and the output of the network as a whole are shown to\nprovide uniquely useful signals indicating network weight convergence without\nthe need to access network weights. A novel heuristic method for network size\nselection is proposed which makes use of noise events and their feature\nrepresentations. The use of selection thresholds is shown to produce network\nactivation patterns that predict classification accuracy allowing rapid\nevaluation and optimization of system parameters without the need to run\nback-end classifiers.

While flows with fluctuations\nin thermodynamic variables are much more common, much less is known about these\nflows than their incompressible counterparts in which thermodynamics is\ndecoupled from hydrodynamics. A critical element in the study of the latter has\nbeen the concept of universal scaling laws which provides fundamental as well\nas practical information about the spatio-temporal behavior of these complex\nsystems. Part of this success is due to the dependence on a single\nnon-dimensional parameter, that is the Reynolds number. Universality in\ncompressible flows, on the other hand, have proven to be more elusive as no\nunifying set of parameters were found to yield universal scaling laws. This\nseverely limits our understanding of these flows and the successful development\nof theoretically sound models. Using results in specific asymptotic limits of\nthe governing equations we show that universal scaling is indeed observed when\nthe set of governing parameters is expanded to include internally generated\ndilatational scales which are the result of the driving mechanisms that produce\nthe turbulence.

In this context, tree sampling-based planners have\nbeen developed, some of which achieve asymptotic optimality by propagating\nrandom controls during each iteration. While desirable for the analysis, random\ncontrols result in slow convergence to high quality trajectories in practice.\n  This short position statement first argues that if a kinodynamic planner has\naccess to local maneuvers that appropriately balance an\nexploitation-exploration trade-off, the planner's per iteration performance is\nsignificantly improved. Generating such maneuvers during planning can be\nachieved by curating a large sample of random controls. This is, however,\ncomputationally very expensive. If such maneuvers can be generated fast, the\nplanner's performance will also improve as a function of computation time.\n  Towards objective, this short position statement argues for the integration\nof modern machine learning frameworks with state-of-the-art, informed and\nasymptotically optimal kinodynamic planners. The proposed approach involves\nusing using neural networks to infer local maneuvers for a robotic system with\ndynamics, which properly balance the above exploitation-exploration trade-off.\nIn particular, a neural network architecture is proposed, which is trained to\nreflect the choices of an online curation process, given local obstacle and\nheuristic information.

We adopt these attributes on shocks formed\nfrom disturbances due to the bimodal solar wind, CME deflection, irregular CME\nexpansion, and the ubiquitous fluctuations in the solar corona. In order to\nunderstand the role of a wavy shock in particle acceleration, we define three\ninitial smooth shock morphologies each one associated with a fast CME. Using\npolar Gaussian profiles we model these shocks in the low corona. We establish\nthe corrugated appearance on smooth shock by using combinations of wave-like\nfunctions that represent the disturbances from medium and CME piston. For both\nshock types, smooth and corrugated, we calculate the shock normal angles\nbetween the shock normal and the radial upstream coronal magnetic field in\norder to classify the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular regions. We\nconsider that corrugated shocks are predisposed to different process of\nparticle acceleration due to irregular distributions of shock normal angles\naround of the shock. We suggest that disturbances due to CME irregular\nexpansion may be a decisive factor in origin of particle acceleration. Finally,\nwe regard that accepting these features on shocks may be the start point for\ninvestigating some questions in the sheath and shock, like downstream-jets,\ninstabilities, shock thermalization, shock stability, and injection particle\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 05:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

However, current analyses of AI in a global context are biased\ntoward perspectives held in the U.S., and limited by a lack of research,\nespecially outside the U.S. and Western Europe.\n  This article summarizes the key findings of a literature review of recent\nsocial science scholarship on the social impacts of AI and related technologies\nin five global regions. Our team of social science researchers reviewed more\nthan 800 academic journal articles and monographs in over a dozen languages.\n  Our review of the literature suggests that AI is likely to have markedly\ndifferent social impacts depending on geographical setting. Likewise,\nperceptions and understandings of AI are likely to be profoundly shaped by\nlocal cultural and social context.\n  Recent research in U.S. settings demonstrates that AI-driven technologies\nhave a pattern of entrenching social divides and exacerbating social\ninequality, particularly among historically-marginalized groups. Our literature\nreview indicates that this pattern exists on a global scale, and suggests that\nlow- and middle-income countries may be more vulnerable to the negative social\nimpacts of AI and less likely to benefit from the attendant gains.\n  We call for rigorous ethnographic research to better understand the social\nimpacts of AI around the world. Global, on-the-ground research is particularly\ncritical to identify AI systems that may amplify social inequality in order to\nmitigate potential harms. Deeper understanding of the social impacts of AI in\ndiverse social settings is a necessary precursor to the development,\nimplementation, and monitoring of responsible and beneficial AI technologies,\nand forms the basis for meaningful regulation of these technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 06:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

Usually, a cutting plane is generated to cut\noff a specific infeasible point. The underlying idea is to use the infeasible\npoint to restrict the feasible region in order to obtain a tighter domain. To\nensure validity, we require that every valid cut separating the infeasible\npoint from the restricted feasible region is still valid for the original\nfeasible region. We translate this requirement in terms of the separation\nproblem and the reverse polar. In particular, if the reverse polar of the\nrestricted feasible region is the same as the reverse polar of the feasible\nregion, then any cut valid for the restricted feasible region that separates\nthe infeasible point, is valid for the feasible region. We show that the\nreverse polar of the visible points of the feasible region from the infeasible\npoint coincides with the reverse polar of the feasible region.

My\nmathematical analysis of this situation, although simple, was able to\nillustrate the main property of the experiment, namely that it showed the\naction from the radiation forces on the dielectric boundaries, and from the\nLorentz force in the interior, but it had not any relationship to the\nAbraham-Minkowski momentum problem as was originally stated by the\ninvestigators. (2) The second point was my emphasis on the fact that in an\nelectromagnetic pulse in a medium there cannot be an accompanying mechanical\nenergy density of the same order of magnitude as the electromagnetic energy\ndensity itself. The electromagnetic wave carries with it a mechanical {\\it\nmomentum}, but not a mechanical {\\it energy}. Here I illustrate this point by a\nsimple numerical analysis. (3) When going to a relativistic formulation of the\nelectromagnetic theory in matter, care must be taken to secure that fundamental\nconditions from field theory are satisfied. In particular, one cannot in\ngeneral take the electromagnetic total energy and momentum of a radiation pulse\nto constitute a four-vector; such a property holds only if the electromagnetic\nenergy-momentum tensor is divergence-free.

A nearly universal feature of MD numerical\nintegration schemes for equations of motion based on imaginary-time path\nintegrals is the use of harmonic normal modes for the exact evolution of the\nfree ring-polymer positions and momenta. In this work, we demonstrate that this\nstandard practice creates numerical artifacts.

We present observations of four\nhomologous global waves originating from the same active region between 28-30\nMarch 2014 and observed using both EUV and H-alpha data.

The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized\nthrough a second-order finite difference scheme, with non-uniform grids in two\ndirections. The duct cross-sectional area is maintained constant as well as the\nflow rate, which allows to investigate which is the appropriate length scale in\nthe Reynolds number for a good scaling in the laminar and in the fully\nturbulent regimes. We find that the Reynolds number based on the half length of\nthe short side leads to a critical Reynolds number which is independent on the\naspect ratio (AR), for ducts with AR>1. The mean and rms wall-normal velocity\nprofiles are found to scale with the local value of the friction velocity. At\nhigh friction Reynolds numbers, the Reynolds number dependence is similar to\nthat in turbulent plane channels, hence flows in rectangular ducts allow to\ninvestigate the Reynolds number dependency through a reduced number of\nsimulations. At low Re the profiles of the statistics differ from those in the\ntwo-dimensional channel due to the interaction of flow structures of different\nsize. The projection of the velocity vector and of the Reynolds stress tensor\nalong the eigenvectors of the strain-rate tensor yields reduced Reynolds stress\nanisotropy, and simple turbulent kinetic energy budgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 10:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

Information at high spatial and spectral resolution in the FIR, taken\nfrom atomic fine-structure lines, highly excited CO, and especially from water\nlines would, however, open the door for transformative science. This calls for\ninterferometric concepts. We present first results of our feasibility study\nIRASSI (Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry) for a FIR space\ninterferometer. Extending on the principal concept of the ESPRIT study, it\nfeatures heterodyne interferometry within a swarm of 5 satellite elements.

Efficient\nsnapshotting of applications is crucial in the deployment of pre-initialized\napplications or moving running applications to different machines, e.g for\ndebugging purposes. A key issue is that snapshotting blocks all other\noperations. In modern latency-sensitive applications, stopping the application\nto persist its state needs to be avoided, because users may not tolerate the\nincreased request latency. In order to minimize the impact of snapshotting on\nrequest latency, our approach persists the application's state asynchronously\nby capturing partial heaps, completing snapshots step by step.

Firstly, focusing on Large-Scale Structure\n(LSS) data, I will show that current cosmological probes contain a wealth of\ninformation on the sum of the neutrino masses. I report on the analysis leading\nto the currently best upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of\n$0.12\\,{\\rm eV}$. I show how cosmological data exhibits a weak preference for\nthe normal neutrino mass ordering because of parameter space volume effects,\nand propose a simple method to quantify this preference. Secondly, I will\ndiscuss how galaxy bias represents a severe limitation towards fully\ncapitalizing on the neutrino information hidden in LSS data. I propose a method\nfor calibrating the scale-dependent galaxy bias using CMB lensing-galaxy\ncross-correlations. Moreover, in the presence of massive neutrinos, the usual\ndefinition of bias becomes inadequate, as it leads to a scale-dependence on\nlarge scales which has never been accounted for. I show that failure to define\nthe bias appropriately will be a problem for future LSS surveys, and propose a\nsimple recipe to account for the effect of massive neutrinos on galaxy bias.\nFinally, I discuss implications of correlations between neutrino parameters and\nother cosmological parameters. In non-phantom dynamical dark energy models, the\nupper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses becomes tighter than the\n$\\Lambda$CDM limit. Therefore, such models exhibit an even stronger preference\nfor the normal ordering, and their viability could be jeopardized should\nnear-future laboratory experiments determine that the mass ordering is\ninverted. I then discuss correlations between neutrino and inflationary\nparameters. I find that our determination of inflationary parameters is stable\nagainst assumptions about the neutrino sector.

However, both OARSI and KL grading systems suffer from moderate\ninter-rater agreement, and therefore, the use of computer-aided methods could\nhelp to improve the reliability of the process. In this study, we developed a\nrobust, automatic method to simultaneously predict KL and OARSI grades in knee\nradiographs. Our method is based on Deep Learning and leverages an ensemble of\ndeep residual networks with 50 layers, squeeze-excitation and ResNeXt blocks.\nHere, we used transfer learning from ImageNet with a fine-tuning on the whole\nOsteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. An independent testing of our model\nwas performed on the whole Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) dataset. Our\nmulti-task method yielded Cohen's kappa coefficients of 0.82 for KL-grade and\n0.79, 0.84, 0.94, 0.83, 0.84, 0.90 for femoral osteophytes, tibial osteophytes\nand joint space narrowing for lateral and medial compartments respectively.\nFurthermore, our method yielded area under the ROC curve of 0.98 and average\nprecision of 0.98 for detecting the presence of radiographic OA (KL $\\geq 2$),\nwhich is better than the current state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 12:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

This photonic\ncircuit can be electrically reconfigured, but only the output optical signal\ncan be monitored. As a result, the conventional control methods cannot be\nnaively applied. Characterizing such a chip is challenging for three reasons.\nFirst, there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian describing the\nchip. Second, we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the\nchip's electrical response, which cannot be directly observed. Finally, there\nare imperfections in the measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip\nexternally to optical fibers. We developed a deep neural network approach to\nsolve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically to overcome the\naforementioned challenges using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network as\nthe central component.

In order to guarantee privacy,\ndifferential privacy mechanisms add noise to either data or query, thus\nintroducing errors to queries made and potentially decreasing the utility of\ninformation. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, our method achieves\nsignificantly lower error as it is the first data- and query-aware approach for\nsuch queries. The key challenge for answering range queries on trajectory data\nprivately is to ensure an accurate count. Simply representing a trajectory as a\nset instead of \\emph{sequence} of points will generally lead to highly\ninaccurate query answers as it ignores the sequential dependency of location\npoints in trajectories, i.e., will violate the consistency of trajectory data.\nFurthermore, trajectories are generally unevenly distributed across a city and\nadding noise uniformly will generally lead to a poor utility. To achieve\ndifferential privacy, our algorithm adaptively adds noise to the input data\naccording to the given query set. It first privately partitions the data space\ninto uniform regions and computes the traffic density of each region. The\nregions and their densities, in addition to the given query set, are then used\nto estimate the distribution of trajectories over the queried space, which\nensures high accuracy for the given query set. We show the accuracy and\nefficiency of our algorithm using extensive empirical evaluations on real and\nsynthetic data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 13:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

Many\nastronomers are deeply concerned about climate change and act upon it in their\npersonal and professional lives, and many organizations within astronomy have\nincorporated incremental changes. We need a collective impact model to better\nnetwork and grow our efforts so that we can achieve results that are on the\nscale appropriate to address climate change at the necessary level indicated by\nscientific research; e.g., becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We need to\nimplement strategies within two primary drivers of our field: (1) Education and\nOutreach, and (2) Research Practices and Infrastructure. (1) In the classroom\nand through public talks, astronomers reach a large audience. Astronomy is\nclosely connected to the science of climate change, and it is arguably the most\nimportant topic we include in our curriculum. Due to misinformation and\ndisinformation, climate change communication is different than for other areas\nof science. We therefore need to expand our communication and implement\neffective strategies, for which there is now a considerable body of research.\n(2) On a per-person basis astronomers have an outsized carbon impact. There are\nnumerous ways we can reduce our footprint; e.g., in the design and operation of\ntelescope facilities and in the optimization and reduction of travel.\nFortunately, many of these solutions are win-win scenarios, e.g., increasing\nthe online presence of conferences will reduce the carbon footprint while\nincreasing participation, especially for astronomers working with fewer\nfinancial resources. Astronomers have an obligation to act on climate change in\nevery way possible, and we need to do it now.

Successful\ndevelopment of high performance in storing and processing huge amounts of data\nin large-scale clusters necessitates accurate quality of service (QoS)\nevaluation. This leads to develop as well as design, analytical models to\nunderstand and predict of complex system behaviour in order to ensure\navailability of large-scale systems.

Rankings send out powerful signals, which lead to identify the\nactions of top performers as the `best practices' that others should also\nadopt. However, several studies have shown that the imitation of best practices\noften leads to a drop in performance. So, should those lagging behind in a\nranking imitate top performers or should they instead pursue a strategy of\ntheir own? I tackle this question by numerically simulating a stylised model of\na society whose agents seek to climb a ranking either by imitating the actions\nof top performers or by randomly trying out different actions, i.e., via\nserendipity. The model gives rise to a rich phenomenology, showing that the\nimitation of top performers increases welfare overall, but at the cost of\nhigher inequality. Indeed, the imitation of top performers turns out to be a\nself-defeating strategy that consolidates the early advantage of a few lucky -\nand not necessarily talented - winners, leading to a very unequal, homogenised,\nand effectively non-meritocratic society. Conversely, serendipity favours\nmeritocratic outcomes and prevents rankings from freezing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 13:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 08:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Super point detection plays\nan important role in network research and application. With the increase of\nnetwork scale, distributed super point detection has become a hot research\ntopic. Compared with single-node super point detection algorithm, the\ndifficulty of super point detection in multi-node distributed environment is\nhow to reduce communication overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nthree-stage communication distributed super point detection algorithm: Rough\nEstimator based Asynchronous Distributed super point detection algorithm\n(READ). READ uses a lightweight estimator, the Rough Estimator (RE), which is\nfast in computation and takes less memory to generate candidate super point. At\nthe same time, the Linear Estimator (LE) is used to accurately estimate the\ncardinality of each candidate super point, so as to detect the super point\ncorrectly. In READ, each node scans IP address pairs asynchronously. When\nreaching the time window boundary, READ starts three-stage communication to\ndetect the super point. In this paper, we proof that the accuracy of READ in\ndistributed environment is no less than that in the single node environment.\nFour groups of 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s real-world high-speed network traffic are\nused to test READ. The experimental results show that READ not only has higher\naccuracy in distributed environment, but also has less than 5% of communication\nburden compared with existing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

We compare these new detections to the ringed continuum mm-dust\nemission and the spatially resolved CO (J=3-2) and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission. The\nradial distributions of the H13CO+ and HC15N emission show hints of ringed\nsub-structure whereas, the optically thick tracers, CO and HCO+, do not. We\ncalculate the HCO+/H13CO+ intensity ratio across the disk and find that it is\nradially constant (within our uncertainties). We use a physio-chemical\nparametric disk structure of the HD97048 disk with an analytical prescription\nfor the HCO+ abundance distribution to generate synthetic observations of the\nHCO+ and H13CO+ disk emission assuming LTE. The best by-eye fit models require\nradial variations in the HCO+/H13CO+ abundance ratio and an overall enhancement\nin H13CO+ relative to HCO+.

Some typical models are to learn the proper embedding between the\nimage feature space and the semantic space, whilst it is important to learn\ndiscriminative features and comprise the coarse-to-fine image feature and\nsemantic information. In this paper, we propose a discriminative embedding\nautoencoder with a regressor feedback model for ZSL. The encoder learns a\nmapping from the image feature space to the discriminative embedding space,\nwhich regulates both inter-class and intra-class distances between the learned\nfeatures by a margin, making the learned features be discriminative for object\nrecognition. The regressor feedback learns to map the reconstructed samples\nback to the the discriminative embedding and the semantic embedding, assisting\nthe decoder to improve the quality of the samples and provide a generalization\nto the unseen classes.

This problem is\nNP-complete, and remains so in very restricted classes of graphs. It is also\nW[2]-complete with respect to the size of the solution.

LARS was proposed as an efficient\nalgorithm for parameter estimation and variable selection for the normal linear\nmodel. The LARS algorithm is described in terms of Euclidean geometry regarding\nthe correlation as the metric of the parameter space. Since the LARS algorithm\nonly works in Euclidean space, we transform a manifold of the statistical model\ninto the tangent space at the origin.

All such models studied so far have a common feature:\nan associated cubic equation (spectral curve), one of whose solutions can be\nexpressed in terms of the Cauchy transform of the limiting eigenvalue\ndistribution. This is our starting point: we show that to any such spectral\ncurve (not necessarily given by a random matrix ensemble) it corresponds a\nunique vector-valued measure with three components on the complex plane,\ncharacterized as a solution of a variational problem stated in terms of their\nlogarithmic energy. We describe all possible geometries of the supports of\nthese measures; in particular the third component, if non-trivial, lives on a\ncontour on the plane. This general result is applied to the random matrix model\nwith external source, under an additional assumption of uniform boundedness of\nthe zeros of a sequence of average characteristic polynomials in the large\nmatrix limit. It is shown that any limiting zero distribution for such a\nsequence can be written in terms of a solution of a spectral curve, and thus\nadmits the variational description obtained in the first part of the paper. As\na consequence of our analysis, we obtain that the density of this limiting\nmeasure can have only a handful of local behaviors: sine, Airy and their higher\norder type behavior, Pearcey or yet the fifth power of the cubic (but no higher\norder cubics can appear). We also compare our findings with the most general\nresults available in the literature, showing that once an additional symmetry\nis imposed, our vector critical measure contains enough information to recover\nthe solutions to the constrained equilibrium problem that was known to describe\nthe limiting eigenvalue distribution in this symmetric situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 12:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 22:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

Usually, precedence constraints\nare given by a partial order on the set of jobs, and each job requires all its\npredecessors to be completed before it can start. In his seminal paper, Graham\n(1966) presented a simple 2-approximation algorithm, and, more than 40 years\nlater, Svensson (2010) proved that 2 is essentially the best approximation\nratio one can hope for in general. In this paper, we consider a different type\nof precedence relation that has not been discussed as extensively and is called\nOR-precedence. In order for a job to start, we require that at least one of its\npredecessors is completed - in contrast to all its predecessors. Additionally,\nwe assume that each job has a release date before which it must not start. We\nprove that Graham's algorithm has an approximation guarantee of 2 also in this\nsetting, and present a polynomial-time algorithm that solves the problem to\noptimality, if preemptions are allowed.

Given the assumption of anisotropy in the dependence of a\nfunction, we show that sensitivity indices can be computed with a reduced\nnumber of model evaluations. Second, we discuss methods for evaluating\nsensitivities when constrained near output extrema. Methods based on the\nanalysis of skewness are reviewed and a novel type of indices based on Monte\nCarlo filtering (MCF) -- extremum Sobol' indices -- is proposed.

Specifically, we use nonlinear\nregistration of a neuroimage to a reflected version of itself (\"reflective\nregistration\") to determine for each voxel its homologous (corresponding) voxel\nin the other hemisphere. A patch around the homologous voxel is added as a set\nof new features to the segmentation algorithm. To evaluate this method, we\nimplemented two different CNN-based multimodal MRI stroke lesion segmentation\nalgorithms, and then augmented them by adding extra symmetry features using the\nreflective registration method described above. For each architecture, we\ncompared the performance with and without symmetry augmentation, on the SISS\nTraining dataset of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Challenge (ISLES)\n2015 challenge. Using affine reflective registration improves performance over\nbaseline, but nonlinear reflective registration gives significantly better\nresults: an improvement in Dice coefficient of 13 percentage points over\nbaseline for one architecture and 9 points for the other.

In electronic devices, shot noise arises from the\ndiscrete nature of charge carriers and it increases linearly with the applied\nvoltage according to the celebrated Schottky formula. Nonetheless, measurements\nof shot noise in atomic-scale junctions at high voltage reveal significant\nnonlinear (anomalous) behavior, which varies from sample to sample, and has no\nspecific trend. Here, we provide a viable, unifying explanation for these\ndiverse observations based on the theory of quantum coherent transport. Our\nformula for the anomalous shot noise relies on---and allows us to resolve---two\nkey characteristics of a conducting junction: The structure of the transmission\nfunction at the vicinity of the Fermi energy and the asymmetry of the bias\nvoltage drop at the contacts. We tested our theory on high voltage shot noise\nmeasurements on Au atomic scale junctions and demonstrated a quantitative\nagreement, recovering both the enhancement and suppression of shot noise as\nobserved in different junctions. The good theory-experiment correspondence\nsupports our modelling and emphasizes that the asymmetry of the bias drop on\nthe contacts is a key factor in nanoscale electronic transport, which may\nsubstantially impact electronic signals even in incomplex structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

The success of the majority of existing representation learning\napproaches often requires a large amount of consistent and noise-free labels.\nHowever, labels are not accessible in many real-world scenarios and they are\nusually annotated by the crowds. In practice, the crowdsourced labels are\nusually inconsistent among crowd workers given their diverse expertise and the\nnumber of crowdsourced labels is very limited. Thus, directly adopting\ncrowdsourced labels for existing representation learning algorithms is\ninappropriate and suboptimal. In this paper, we investigate the above problem\nand propose a novel framework of \\textbf{R}epresentation \\textbf{L}earning with\ncrowdsourced \\textbf{L}abels, i.e., \"RLL\", which learns representation of data\nwith crowdsourced labels by jointly and coherently solving the challenges\nintroduced by limited and inconsistent labels. The proposed representation\nlearning framework is evaluated in two real-world education applications. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach on learning\nrepresentation from limited labeled data from the crowds, and show RLL is able\nto outperform state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, detailed experiments are\nconducted on RLL to fully understand its key components and the corresponding\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 03:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

It consists in shorting a supercapacitor for a\nshort time $\\tau$, then switching to the open circuit regime and measuring an\ninitial rebound and long-time relaxation. The results obtained are: the ratio\nof \"easy\" and \"hard\" to access capacitance and the dependence $C(\\tau)$, that\ndetermines what the capacitance the system responds at time-scale $\\tau$; it\ncan be viewed as an alternative to used by some manufacturers approach to\ncharacterize a supercapacitor by fixed capacitance and time-scale dependent\ninternal resistance. Among the advantages of proposed technique is that it does\nnot require a source of fixed current, what simplifies the setup and allows a\nhigh discharge current regime. The approach can be used as a replacement of\nlow-frequency impedance measurements and the ones of IEC 62391 type, it can be\neffectively applied to characterization of supercapacitors and other relaxation\ntype systems with porous internal structure.
