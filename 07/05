A\ncommon approach to modeling random multiphase materials is to develop so-called\nsurrogate models approximating statistical features of the material. However,\nthe surrogate models used in fatigue analysis usually employ simple\nmicrostructure, consisting of ideal geometries such as ellipsoidal inclusions,\nwhich generally does not capture complex geometries. In this paper, we\nintroduce a simple but flexible surrogate microstructure model for two-phase\nmaterials through a level-cut of a Gaussian random field with covariance of\nMat\\'ern class. Such parametrization of the covariance function allows for the\nrepresentation of a few key design parameters while representing the geometry\nof inclusions in a more general setting for a large class of random\nheterogeneous two-phase media. In addition to the traditional morphology\ndescriptors such as porosity, size and aspect ratio, it provides control of the\nregularity of the inclusions interface and sphericity. These parameters are\nestimated from a small number of real material images using Bayesian inversion.\nAn efficient process of evaluating the samples, based on the Fast Fourier\nTransform, makes possible the use of Monte-Carlo methods to estimate\nstatistical properties for the quantities of interest in a given material\nclass. We demonstrate the overall framework of the use of the surrogate\nmaterial model in application to the uncertainty quantification in fatigue\nanalysis, its feasibility and efficiency, and its role in the microstructure\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 16:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

We extend the application of\nthis technique to the study of Lorentz-violating and potentially CPT-violating\noperators from the minimal standard model extension. For dimension-4 operators,\nthere are nontrivial relations between the coefficients of baryon-level\noperators related to underlying quark and gluon operators with the same Lorentz\nstructures. Moreover, in the mapping of the dimension-3 operators from the\nquark and gluon level to the hadron level (considered here for the first time),\nmany of the hadronic observables contain no new low-energy coupling constants\nat all, which makes it possible to make direct translations of bounds derived\nusing experiments on one kind of hadron into bounds in a completely different\ncorner of the hadronic sector.

This is pronouncedly different from the\nskin-friction coefficient $C_f$, which in the fully rough turbulent regime is\nindependent of $Re$, due to the dominant pressure drag. In rough-wall\nturbulence the absence of the analog to pressure drag in the temperature\nadvection equation is the origin for the very different scaling properties of\nthe heat transfer as compared to the momentum transfer. This analysis suggests\nthat, unlike momentum transfer, the asymptotic ultimate regime, where $Nu\\sim\nRa^{1/2}$, will never be reached for heat transfer at finite $Ra$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 17:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

Here, we use\nquantum-mechanical simulations to provide an in-depth analysis of the phonon\nproperties of isoreticular MOFs. We consider phonon band structures, spatial\nconfinements of modes, projected densities of states, and group velocity\ndistributions. We find that more complex linkers shift the spectral weight of\nthe phonon density of states towards higher frequencies, while increasing the\nmass of the metal atoms in the nodes has the opposite effect. Due to the high\nporosity of MOFs, we observe a particularly pronounced polarization dependence\nof the dispersion of acoustic phonons with rather high group velocities for\nlongitudinal acoustic modes. Interestingly, also for several optical phonon\nmodes group velocities amounting to several thousand m/s are obtained. For\nheterogeneous systems like MOFs, correlating group velocities and the\ndisplacement of modes is particularly relevant. Here we find that high group\nvelocities are generally associated with delocalized vibrations, while the\ninverse correlation does not necessarily hold. To quantify anharmonicities, we\ncalculate mode Gr\\\"uneisen parameters, which we find to be significant only for\nphonons with frequencies below ~3 THz.

We derive constraints on\nthe Tsallis entropies that are implied by (conditional) independence between\nclassical random variables and apply these to causal structures.

In general, bipartite channels can produce entangled states,\nand can be used to simulate quantum operations that are not local. While much\neffort over the last two decades has been devoted to the study of entanglement\nof bipartite states, very little is known about the entanglement of bipartite\nchannels. In this work, we rigorously study the entanglement of bipartite\nchannels as a resource theory of quantum processes. We present an infinite and\ncomplete family of measures of dynamical entanglement, which gives necessary\nand sufficient conditions for convertibility under local operations and\nclassical communication. Then we focus on the dynamical resource theory where\nfree operations are positive partial transpose (PPT) superchannels, but we do\nnot assume that they are realized by PPT pre- and post-processing. This leads\nto a greater mathematical simplicity that allows us to express all resource\nprotocols and the relevant resource measures in terms of semi-definite\nprograms. Along the way, we generalize the negativity from states to channels,\nand introduce the max-logarithmic negativity, which has an operational\ninterpretation as the exact asymptotic entanglement cost of a bipartite\nchannel. Finally, we use the non-positive partial transpose (NPT) resource\ntheory to derive a no-go result: it is impossible to distill entanglement out\nof bipartite PPT channels under any sets of free superchannels that can be used\nin entanglement theory. This allows us to generalize one of the long-standing\nopen problems in quantum information - the NPT bound entanglement problem -\nfrom bipartite states to bipartite channels. It further leads us to the\ndiscovery of bound entangled POVMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 18:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:08:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 01:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 19:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 11:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 02:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Although innovations in wearable\nrobots aim to alleviate this hazard, the majority of existing exoskeletons are\nobtrusive because the rigid linkage design limits natural movement, thus\ncausing ergonomic risk. Moreover, these existing systems are typically only\nsuitable for one type of movement assistance, not ubiquitous for a wide variety\nof activities.

This spine-inspired wearable robot\nis unobtrusive and assists both squat and stoops while not impeding walking\nmotion. To tackle the challenge of the unique anatomy of spine that is\ninappropriate to be simplified as a single degree of freedom joint, our robot\nis conformal to human anatomy and it can reduce multiple types of forces along\nthe human spine such as the spinae muscle force, shear, and compression force\nof the lumbar vertebrae.

With nanophotonics being an experiment-driven\nfield, the absence of appropriate theoretical methods to describe\nground-breaking advances has often emerged as an important issue. To address\nthis problem, the temptation to directly transfer and extend concepts already\navailable from quantum optics is strong, even if a rigorous justification is\nnot always available. In this Review we discuss situations where, in our view,\nthis strategy has indeed overstepped its bounds. We focus on exciton--plasmon\ninteractions, and particularly on the idea of calculating the number of\nexcitons involved in the coupling. We analyse how, starting from an unfounded\ninterpretation of the term N/V that appears in theoretical descriptions at\ndifferent levels of complexity, one might be tempted to make independent\nassumptions for what the number N and the volume V are, and attempt to\ncalculate them separately. Such an approach can lead to different, often\ncontradictory results, depending on the initial assumptions (e.g. through\ndifferent treatments of $V$ as the -- ambiguous in plasmonics -- mode volume).\nWe argue that the source of such contradictions is the question itself -- How\nmany excitons are coupled?, which disregards the true nature of the coupled\ncomponents of the system, has no meaning and often not even any practical\nimportance. If one is interested in validating the quantum nature of the system\n-- which appears to be the motivation driving the pursuit of strong coupling\nwith small N -- one could instead focus on quantities such as the photon\nemission rate or the second-order correlation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 21:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 14:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

To such a PDE\nwe associate an indicial conic, which is an affine plane curve of degree two.\nThen comes the concept of regular singularity and finally convergence theorems,\nwhich must necessarily take into account the type of PDE (parabolic, elliptical\nor hyperbolic) and a nonresonance condition.

The water-based FSR consists of a\nbandpass type frequency selective surface (FSS) and a 3D printing container.\nThe water substrate is filled into the sealed space constructed by the above\ntwo structures. The numerical simulation results show that the FSR can achieve\nabsorption with high absorptivity from 8.3 to 15.2 GHz, and obtain a\ntransmission band of 5.2 to 7.0 GHz. The minimum insertion loss of the\ntransmission band reaches 0.72 dB at 6.14 GHz. In addition, the FSR has the\nreconfigurable characteristics of absorbing or reflecting electromagnetic waves\nby filling with water or not. The proposed water-based FSR shows its good\ntransmission/absorption performance under different polarizations and oblique\nincident angles. Due to the Debye model of water, the absorption band can be\nadjusted by water temperature, while the passband remains stable.

In this work, we primarily focus on two iterative algorithms:\nProximal Gradient Descent (PGD) and Coordinate Descent (CD). Gradient descent\n(GD) is a special case of these algorithms. PGD is typically used in the\ndata-parallel setting, where data is partitioned across different samples,\nwhereas, CD is used in the model-parallelism setting, where data is partitioned\nacross the parameter space.\n  In this paper, we propose a method based on data encoding and error\ncorrection over real numbers to combat adversarial attacks.

This challenges our current notion of NLS1s having\nlow M_BH . To resolve this tension of low M_BH values in NLS1s, we fitted the\nobserved optical spectrum of a sample of radio-loud NLS1s (RL-NLS1s),\nradio-quiet NLS1s (RQ-NLS1s) and radio-quiet broad line Seyfert 1 galaxies\n(RQ-BLS1s) of about 500 each with the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk\n(AD) model.

While the derived M_BH values of RQ-BLS1s are\nsimilar to their virial masses, for NLS1s the derived M_ADBH values are about\nan order of magnitude larger than their virial estimates. Our analysis thus\nindicates that NLS1s have M_BH similar to RQ-BLS1s and their available virial\nM_BH values are underestimated influenced by their observed relatively small\nemission line widths. Considering Eddington ratio as an estimation of the\naccretion rate and using M_ADBH, we found the mean accretion rate of our\nRQ-NLS1s, RL-NLS1s and RQ-BLS1s as 0.06 (+0.16, -0.05), 0.05 (+0.18, -0.04) and\n0.05 (+0.15, -0.04) respectively.

INTRODUCTION The constitutive parameters of hyperelastic models are\ngenerally identified from three homogeneous tests, basically the uniaxial\ntension, the pure shear and the equibiaxial tension. From about 10 years, an\nalternative methodology has been developed [1, 2, 3, 4], and consists in\nperforming only one heterogeneous test as long as the field is sufficiently\nheterogeneous. This is tipically the case when a multiaxial loading is applied\nto a 3 branch or a 4-branch cruciform specimen, which induces a large number of\nmechanical states at the specimen surface. The induced heterogeneity is\ngenerally analysed through the distribution of the biaxiality ratio and the\nmaximal eigen value of the strain. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC)\ntechnique is generally used to retrieve the different mechanical states\ninduces, and provides the full kinematic field at the specimen surface, i.e. a\nlarge number of experimental data to be analysed to identify the constitutive\nparameters of the behaviour model considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 06:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

Ishizuka and M. Sato, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 122, 197702 (2019)]. Using a non-linear response theory for magnons, we\nanalyze the dc spin current generated by a linearly-polarized electromagnetic\nwave (typically, terahertz or gigahertz waves). Considering noncentrosymmetric\ntwo-sublattice magnets as an example, we find a finite dc spin current\nconductivity at $T=0$, where no thermally-excited magnons exist; this is in\ncontrast to the case of the spinon spin current, in which the optical\ntransition of the Fermi degenerate spinons plays an essential role.

A natural question\nconcerns their connections to substructural logics which are described by means\nof residuated lattices or posets. In a previous paper it was shown that an\neffect algebra can be organized into a so-called conditionally residuated\nstructure where the adjointness condition holds only for those elements for\nwhich multiplication and implication are defined. Because this is a very strong\nrestriction, we try to find another kind of residuation where the terms\noccurring in the adjointness condition are everywhere defined though the binary\noperation of a given effect algebra is only partial. Moreover, we work with\neffect algebras which need not be lattice-ordered and hence the lattice\noperations join and meet are replaced by means of upper and lower cones which,\nhowever, are not elements but subsets. Hence, the resulting concept, the\nso-called unsharp residuated poset, is equipped with LU-terms which substitute\noperations, but are everywhere defined. Although this concept seems rather\ncomplicated at the first glance, we prove that such an unsharp residuated poset\ncan be conversely organized into an effect algebra or a pseudoeffect algebra\ndepending on commutativity of the multiplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 09:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

Different loads are applied and the\nefficiency of the MIC as a whole as well as the load sharing between the\ndifferent sources is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 12:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

By statistically\nanalysing 16 long-living CHs observed by the SDO, we focus on coronal,\nmorphological and underlying photospheric magnetic field characteristics as\nwell as investigate the evolution of the associated HSSs. We use CATCH to\nextract and analyse CHs using observations taken by AIA and HMI. We derive\nchanges in the CH properties and correlate them to the CH evolution. Further we\nanalyse the properties of the HSS signatures near 1au from OMNI data by\nmanually extracting the peak bulk velocity of the solar wind plasma. We find\nthat the area evolution of CHs mostly shows a rough trend of growing to a\nmaximum followed by a decay. No correlation of the area evolution to the\nevolution of the signed magnetic flux and signed magnetic flux density enclosed\nin the projected CH area was found. From this we conclude that the magnetic\nflux within the extracted CH boundaries is not the main cause for its area\nevolution. We derive CH area change rates (growth and decay) of 14.2 +/- 15.0 *\n10^8 km^2/day showing a reasonable anti-correlation (cc =-0.48) to the solar\nactivity, approximated by the sunspot number. The change rates of the signed\nmean magnetic flux density (27.3 +/- 32.2 mG/day) and the signed magnetic flux\n(30.3 +/- 31.5 * 10^18 Mx/day) were also found to be dependent on solar\nactivity (cc =0.50 and cc =0.69 respectively) rather than on the individual CH\nevolutions.

The\nexisting conjecture in brain microstructure imaging trough DW-MRI presents\nwater diffusion in white (WM) and grey (GM) matter as restricted diffusion in\nneurites, modelled by infinite cylinders of null radius embedded in the\nhindered extra-neurite water. The extra-neurite pool in WM corresponds to water\nin the extra-axonal space, but in GM it combines water in the extra-cellular\nspace with water in soma.

In summary, our mathematical results\nformalise the biological notion that clonal selection is driven by the\nself-renewal fraction of leukemic stem cells and the clones that possess the\nhighest value of this parameter are ultimately selected. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of\nnon-stem cells do not have a substantial impact on clonal selection.

As in the original thought experiment, only the second law of\nthermodynamics is seemingly violated when disregarding the demon. The\nautonomous architecture allows us to compare descriptions in terms of\ninformation to a more traditional, thermoelectric characterization. Our\ndetailed investigation of information-to-work conversion is based on\nfluctuation relations and second law like inequalities in addition to the\naverage heat and charge currents. By introducing a time-reversal on the level\nof individual electrons, we find a novel fluctuation relation that is not\nconnected to any symmetry of the moment generating function of heat and\nparticle flows. Furthermore, we show how an effective Markovian master equation\nwith broken detailed balance for the system alone can emerge from a full\ndescription, allowing for an investigation of the entropic cost associated to\nbreaking detailed balance. Interestingly, while the entropic cost of performing\na perfect measurement diverges, the entropic cost of breaking detailed balance\ndoes not. Our results connect various approaches and idealized scenarios found\nin the literature and can be tested experimentally with present day technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 14:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 09:43:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 13:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

To mitigate the register demand, this paper presents a binary\ntranslation technique, called RegDem, that spills excessive registers to the\nunderutilized shared memory by transforming the GPU assembly code (SASS). Most\nGPU programs do not fully use shared memory, thus allowing RegDem to use it for\nregister spilling.

AUGs are buoyancy-driven autonomous\nunderwater vehicles that use small hydrofoils to make forward progress while\nprofiling vertically. During each dive, which can last up to 6 hours, the\nSeaglider AUG used in this experiment typically reaches the depth of 1000 m and\ntravels 3-6 km horizontally through the water, relying solely on\ndead-reckoning. Horizontal through-the-water (TTW) progress of AUG is 20-30\ncm/s, which is comparable to the speed of the stronger ocean currents.\nUnderwater navigation of an AUG in the presence of unknown advection therefore\npresents a considerable challenge. We develop two related formulations for\npost-processing. Both use ADCP observations, through the water velocity\nestimates, and GPS fixes to estimate current profiles. However, while the first\nsolves an explicit inverse problem for the current profiles only, the second\nsolves a deconvolution problem that infers both states and current profiles\nusing a state-space model. Both approaches agree on their estimates of the\nocean current profile through which the AUG was flown using measurements of\ncurrent relative to the AUG from the ADCP, and estimates of the AUGs TTW\nvelocity from a hydrodynamic model. The result is a complete current profile\nalong the AUGs trajectory, as well as over-the-ground (OTG) velocities for the\nAUG that can be used for more accurate subsea positioning.

Ray Lake, the lava lake at Mount Erebus, Ross Island,\nAntarctica, maintains long-term, near steady-state behavior in temperature,\nheat flux, gas flux, lake level, and composition. This activity is superposed\nby periodic small pulses of gas and hot magma every 5-18 minutes and disrupted\nby sporadic Strombolian eruptions. The periodic pulses have been attributed to\na variety of potential processes including unstable bidirectional flow in the\nconduit feeding the lake. In contrast to hypotheses invoking a conduit source\nfor the observed periodicity, we test the hypothesis that the behavior could be\nthe result of dynamics within the lake itself, independent of periodic influx\nfrom the conduit. We perform numerical simulations of convection in Ray Lake\ndriven by both constant and periodic inflow of gas-rich magma from the conduit\nto identify whether the two cases have different observational signatures at\nthe surface.

If designed properly, hash-tables\ncan enable efficients look ups in a constant number of operations or commonly\nreferred to as O(1) operations. As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes\nless structured (as is common for big-data applications), the need for\nefficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce\nHashGraph, a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts\ntaken from sparse graph representations--hence the name HashGraph. We show two\ndifferent variants of HashGraph, a simple algorithm that outlines the method to\ncreate the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a\nmore efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows\na new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use \"open-addressing\" or\n\"chaining\", yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph\ncurrently works for static inputs, though recent progress with dynamic graph\ndata structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as\nwell. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per\nentry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining\napproaches have. Further, we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the\nload-factor. Lastly, we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of\nvalue lookups. Given the above, HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms\nseveral state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of\nHashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs, though HashGraph is not\narchitecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU, HashGraph is anywhere from\n2X-8X faster than cuDPP, WarpDrive, and cuDF.

Their\nimpulsive, often drastic radiative increases, in particular at short\nwavelengths, bring immediate impacts that motivate solar physics and space\nweather research to understand solar flares to the point of being able to\nforecast them. As data and algorithms improve dramatically, questions must be\nasked concerning how well the forecasting performs; crucially, we must ask how\nto rigorously measure performance in order to critically gauge any\nimprovements. Building upon earlier-developed methodology (Barnes et al, 2016,\nPaper I), international representatives of regional warning centers and\nresearch facilities assembled in 2017 at the Institute for Space-Earth\nEnvironmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan to - for the first time -\ndirectly compare the performance of operational solar flare forecasting\nmethods. Multiple quantitative evaluation metrics are employed, with focus and\ndiscussion on evaluation methodologies given the restrictions of operational\nforecasting. Numerous methods performed consistently above the \"no skill\"\nlevel, although which method scored top marks is decisively a function of flare\nevent definition and the metric used; there was no single winner.

Our method is based on a graph\nattention network (GAT) that learns reliable feature representations that\nencode the social interactions between humans in the scene, and a recurrent\nencoder-decoder architecture that is trained adversarially to predict, based on\nthe features, the humans' paths.

However, it is currently unclear whether the\nprogenitors of these supernova (SN) types form a continuum in pre-SN hydrogen\nmass or whether they are physically distinct. SN light-curve morphology\ndirectly relates to progenitor and explosion properties such as the amount of\nhydrogen in the envelope, the pre-SN radius, the explosion energy and the\nsynthesized mass of radioactive material. In this work we study the morphology\nof the optical-wavelength light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe II and\nhydrogen-poor SNe IIb to test whether an observational continuum exists between\nthe two. Using a sample of 95 SNe (73 SNe II and 22 SNe IIb), we define a range\nof key observational parameters and present a comparative analysis between both\ntypes. We find a lack of events that bridge the observed properties of SNe II\nand SNe IIb. Light curve parameters such as rise times and post-maximum decline\nrates and curvatures clearly separate both SN types and we therefore conclude\nthat there is no continuum, with the two SN types forming two observationally\ndistinct families. In the V-band a rise time of 17 days (SNe II lower, SNe IIb\nhigher), and a magnitude difference between 30 and 40 days post explosion of\n0.4 mag (SNe II lower, SNe IIb higher) serve as approximate thresholds to\ndifferentiate both types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 17:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

The\nmodel is applied to a spherical radially-symmetric nano-particle with a silicon\ncore and a graphite shell, highlighting the large effect on lithium\ndistribution and OCV caused by the stress-coupling. Various performance\nmeasures based on the expanded volume, the amount of lithium intercalated and\nthe maximum stress induced, are calculated for a silicon core with a graphite\nshell to enable optimisation of the volume of the silicon core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 16:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

These results are compared with the data\nobtained from the conventional multipole method (MPM). Our simulation results\nreveal that the ERM is an accurate and fast method for dispersion analysis of\nPCFs with large pitch sizes. However, for small pitch sizes of PCFs, it is not\nas accurate as the MPM method. Therefore, ERM is a fast, simple and accurate\nmethod for modeling and analysis of Silica-based PCFs with large pitch sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 13:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}
