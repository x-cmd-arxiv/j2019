We investigate the idea that some of these black holes originate from\nthe centers of extremely low-mass ultra-dwarf galaxies that have merged\ntogether in the distant past at $z>1$. Extrapolating the central black hole to\nstellar mass ratio suggests that the black holes in these mergers could arise\nfrom galaxies of masses $\\sim 10^{5} - 10^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}\\,$. We investigate\nwhether these galaxies merge enough, or too much, to be consistent with the\nobserved GW rate of $\\sim 9.7-101$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ using the latest\nLIGO/Virgo results. We show that in the nearby universe the merger rate and\nnumber densities of ultra-dwarf galaxies are too low, by an order or magnitude,\nto produce these black hole mergers. However, by considering that the merger\nfraction, merger-time scales, and the number densities of low-mass galaxies all\nconspire at $z>1-1.5$ to increase the merger rate for these galaxies at higher\nredshifts we argue that it is possible that some of the observed GW events\narise from BHs in the centers of low-mass galaxies. The major uncertainty in\nthis calculation is the dynamical time-scales for black holes in low-mass\ngalaxies. Our results however suggest a very long BH merger time-scale of 4-7\nGyr, consistent with an extended black hole merger history. Further simulations\nare needed to verify this possibility, however our theory can be tested by\nsearching for host galaxies of gravitational wave events. Results from these\nsearches would will put limits on dwarf galaxy mergers and/or the presence and\nformation mechanisms of black holes through PopIII stars in the lowest mass\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 16:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

Moreover, road boundaries have various shapes,\ncolours and structures while motion planning algorithms require accurate and\nprecise metric information in real-time to generate their plans.\n  In this paper, we present a real-time LIDAR-based approach for accurate curb\ndetection around the vehicle (360 degree). Our approach deals with both\nocclusions from traffic and changing environmental conditions. To this end, we\nproject 3D LIDAR pointcloud data into 2D bird's-eye view images (akin to\nInverse Perspective Mapping). These images are then processed by trained deep\nnetworks to infer both visible and occluded road boundaries. Finally, a\npost-processing step filters detected curb segments and tracks them over time.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on\nreal-world driving data.

This\nconstant value depends on the Hamiltonian and the operator but not on any\nextrinsic tolerance parameter. Thus K-complexity deserves to be an entry in the\nAdS/CFT dictionary. Invoking a concept of K-entropy and some numerical examples\nwe also discuss the extent to which the long period of linear complexity growth\nentails an efficient randomization of operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 17:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The preliminary calculation of the two neutron correlation\nshows a huge asymmetry effect: many more neutrons are emitted anti-parallel to\neach other than parallel to each other. That asymmetry becomes even more if the\nenergy cut on each neutron is done. This study will potentially permit a new\ntechnique for actinide detection for homeland security and safeguards\napplications as well as improve our knowledge of correlated neutron emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 17:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

Our approach to this\nchallenge -- a meta-algorithm called PROPEL -- is based on three insights.\nFirst, we view our learning task as optimization in policy space, modulo the\nconstraint that the desired policy has a programmatic representation, and solve\nthis optimization problem using a form of mirror descent that takes a gradient\nstep into the unconstrained policy space and then projects back onto the\nconstrained space. Second, we view the unconstrained policy space as mixing\nneural and programmatic representations, which enables employing\nstate-of-the-art deep policy gradient approaches. Third, we cast the projection\nstep as program synthesis via imitation learning, and exploit contemporary\ncombinatorial methods for this task. We present theoretical convergence results\nfor PROPEL and empirically evaluate the approach in three continuous control\ndomains. The experiments show that PROPEL can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art approaches for learning programmatic policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 18:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 05:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 12:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 20:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

We provide a unified analysis that yields\nthe worst-case linear convergence rate as a function of the condition number of\nthe local functions, the spectral gap of the graph, and the parameters of the\nalgorithm. The framework requires solving a small semidefinite program whose\nsize is fixed; it does not depend on the number of local functions or the\ndimension of their domain. The result is a computationally efficient method for\ndistributed algorithm analysis that enables the rapid comparison, selection,\nand tuning of algorithms.

In the current paper, although the\ntheory is investigated with the same gauge condition, the effects of the copies\nturn out to be completely different. In other words: in both cases, the copies\nare there, but the effects are very different. As suggested by the tree-level\nexactness of the topological model in this gauge choice, the Gribov copies are\nshown to be inoffensive at the quantum level. To be more precise, following\nGribov, we discuss the path integral restriction to the Gribov horizon. The\nassociated gap equation, which fixes the so-called Gribov parameter, is however\nshown to only possess a trivial solution, making the restriction obsolete. We\nrelate this to the absence of radiative corrections in both gauge and ghost\nsectors.

This permits a search for\nnear-threshold states in the alpha-conjugate nuclei up to 24Mg. Results: Events\nup to an alpha-particle multiplicity of 7 were measured and the results were\ncompared to both an Extended Hauser-Feshbach calculation and the Fermi break-up\nmodel. The measured multiplicity distribution exceeded that predicted from a\nsequential decay mechanism and had a better agreement with the multi-particle\nFermi break-up model. Examination of how these 7 alpha final states could be\nreconstructed to form 8Be and 12C(0_2+) showed a quantitative difference in\nwhich decay modes were dominant compared to the Fermi break-up model. No new\nstates were observed in 16O, 20Ne, and 24Mg due to the effect of the N-alpha\npenetrability suppressing the total alpha-particle dissociation decay mode.\nConclusion: The reaction mechanism for a high energy compound nucleus reaction\ncan only be described by a hybrid of sequential decay and multi-particle\nbreakup. Highly alpha-clustered states were seen which did not originate from\nsimple binary reaction processes.

The analogy shows that the exact formula\nfor the acoustic pressure is given by a convolution product of a propagator\ntensor (determined by the vector Green's function of the adjoint linearized\nEuler equations for a given jet mean flow) and a generalized source term\nrepresenting the jet turbulence field.\n  Using a low frequency/small spread rate asymptotic expansion of the\npropagator, mean flow non-parallelism enters the lowest order Green's function\nsolution via the streamwise component of the mean flow advection vector in a\nhyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE). We then address the predictive\ncapability of the solution to this PDE when used in the analogy through\nfirst-of-its-kind numerical calculations when an experimentally-verified model\nof the turbulence source structure is used together with Reynolds-averaged\nNavier Stokes solutions for the jet mean flow. Our noise predictions show a\nreasonable level of accuracy in the peak noise direction at $Ma=0.9$, for\nStrouhal number up to about $0.6$, and at $Ma=0.5$ using modified source\ncoefficients. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

The geometrical acoustics theory of localised flexural waves\nin wedges of power-law profile is briefly discussed. It is noted that, for\nwedge profiles with power-law exponents equal or larger than two, the\nvelocities of all localised modes take zero values, unless there is a wedge\ntruncation. It is demonstrated that this effect of zero velocities of localised\nflexural waves in ideal wedges is closely related to the phenomenon of zero\nreflection of flexural waves from ideally sharp one-dimensional acoustic black\nholes. A possible influence of localised wedge modes on flexural wave\nreflection from one-dimensional acoustic black holes having rough edges is\ndiscussed. With regard to two-dimensional acoustic black holes, the role of\nlocalised flexural waves propagating along wedge edges that are curved in their\nmiddle plane is considered. Such waves can propagate along edges of inner holes\nin two-dimensional acoustic black holes formed by circular indentations in\nplates of constant thickness. A possible impact of such localised waves on the\nprocesses of scattering of flexural waves by edge imperfections of inner holes\nin two-dimensional acoustic black holes is discussed, including their influence\non the efficiency of two-dimensional acoustic black holes as vibration dampers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 23:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Can the topological\norganisation of these webs provide some insight into their evolutionary\norigins? Both biological and artificial networks share some common\narchitectural traits.

The AMBER observations were carried out in the\nwavelength region of the CO first overtone lines near 2.3 $\\mu$m (R=12 000).\nThe polarimetric imaging capabilities of SPHERE-ZIMPOL have allowed us to\nspatially resolve clumpy dust clouds at 20--50 mas from the central star, which\ncorresponds to 2--5 $R_{\\star}$ when combined with a central star's angular\ndiameter of 20.7$\\pm$1.53 mas measured with AMBER. The diffuse, asymmetric dust\nemission extends out to $\\sim$73 $R_{\\star}$. We find that the TiO emission\nextends to 150 mas (15 $R_{\\star}$). The AMBER data in the CO lines also\nsuggest a molecular outer atmosphere extending to $\\sim$1.5 $R_{\\star}$. The\nresults of our 2-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer modelling of dust clumps\nsuggest that the polarized intensity and degree of linear polarization can be\nreasonably explained by small-sized (0.1 $\\mu$m) grains of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$,\nMgSiO$_{3}$, or Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ in an optically thin shell\n($\\tau_{550\\mathrm{nm}}$=0.5$\\pm$0.1) with an inner boundary radius of 3.5\n$R_{\\star}$. IK Tau's mass-loss rate is 20 to 50 times higher than the\npreviously studied AGB stars W Hya, R Dor, and $o$ Cet. Nevertheless, our\nobservations of IK Tau revealed that clumpy dust formation occurs close to the\nstar as seen in those low mass-rate AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

During these\nsimulations, the bodies exchange angular momentum and energy during close\nencounters, altering their orbits. This energy exchange, however, does not mean\nthat one body necessarily moves closer to exact corotation when the other moves\naway from it. Indeed, if one object moves towards one of these sites, the other\nobject is equally likely to move towards or away from it. This happens because\nthe timescale of these close encounters is short compared to the synodic period\nbetween these particles and the secondary mass (i.e., the timescale where\ncorotation sites can be treated as potential maxima). Because the timescale of\na gravitational encounter is comparable to the timescale of a collision, we\ncould expect energy to be exchanged in a similar way for collisional\ninteractions.

Finally, we discuss potential generalizations\nand extensions to higher dimensions ($d+1\\geq 3$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 02:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

To address this, and to continue our\nwork in this sphere, we performed a study of 289 introductory physics students\nwho were sorted into three different treatment types: stereoscopic virtual\nreality, WebGL simulation, and static 2D images, each designed to provide\ninformation about magnetic fields and forces. Students were assessed using\npreliminary items designed to focus on heavily-3D systems. We report on\nassessment reliability, and on student performance. Overall, we find that\nstudents who used VR did not significantly outperform students using other\ntreatment types. There were significant differences between sexes, as other\nstudies have noted. Dependence on students' self-reported 3D videogame play was\nobserved, in keeping with previous studies, but this dependence was not\nrestricted to the VR treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 03:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

However, it severely suffers from two issues: impotent in capturing\nvery long-term dependencies and unable to parallelize the sequential\ncomputation procedure. Therefore, many non-recurrent sequence models that are\nbuilt on convolution and attention operations have been proposed recently.\nNotably, models with multi-head attention such as Transformer have demonstrated\nextreme effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in a variety of\nsequence modeling tasks. Despite their success, however, these models lack\nnecessary components to model local structures in sequences and heavily rely on\nposition embeddings that have limited effects and require a considerable amount\nof design efforts. In this paper, we propose the R-Transformer which enjoys the\nadvantages of both RNNs and the multi-head attention mechanism while avoids\ntheir respective drawbacks. The proposed model can effectively capture both\nlocal structures and global long-term dependencies in sequences without any use\nof position embeddings.

Twitching is\none such form of motility employed by bacteria such as N. gonorrhoeae, in which\nthe polymeric extensions known as type IV pili mediate its movement. Pili\nextending from cell body adheres to the surface and pulls the bacteria by\nretraction. The bacterial movement is decided by the two-dimensional tug-of-war\nbetween the pili attached to the surface. Natural surfaces in which these\nmicro-crawlers dwell are generally spatially inhomogeneous and have varying\nsurface properties. Their motility is known to be affected by the topography of\nthe surfaces. Therefore, it is possible to control bacterial movement by\ndesigning structured surfaces which can be potentially utilized for controlling\nbiofilm architecture. In this paper, we numerically investigate the twitching\nmotility in a two-dimensional corrugated channel. The bacterial movement is\nsimulated by two different models: (a) a detailed tug-of-war model which\nextensively describe the twitching motility of bacteria assisted by pili and\n(b) a coarse-grained run-and-tumble model which depicts the motion of\nwide-ranging self-propelled particles.

In particular, the variation of the particle current\nwith the geometric parameters of the micro-channels show that one can optimize\nthe particle current for specific values of these parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 06:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 05:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 15:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

This is true even when,\nas is the case in many practical settings, the classifier is hosted as a remote\nservice and so the adversary does not have direct access to the model\nparameters.\n  This paper argues that in such settings, defenders have a much larger space\nof actions than have been previously explored. Specifically, we deviate from\nthe implicit assumption made by prior work that a defense must be a stateless\nfunction that operates on individual examples, and explore the possibility for\nstateful defenses.\n  To begin, we develop a defense designed to detect the process of adversarial\nexample generation. By keeping a history of the past queries, a defender can\ntry to identify when a sequence of queries appears to be for the purpose of\ngenerating an adversarial example. We then introduce query blinding, a new\nclass of attacks designed to bypass defenses that rely on such a defense\napproach.\n  We believe that expanding the study of adversarial examples from stateless\nclassifiers to stateful systems is not only more realistic for many black-box\nsettings, but also gives the defender a much-needed advantage in responding to\nthe adversary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 06:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

The CPRN consists of two complementary sub-networks: a\nshallow network and a deep network that keep the content consistency while\nlearning high frequency differences between low-resolution and high-resolution\nimages. The shallow sub-network employs coupled-projection for better retaining\nthe MRI image details, where a novel feedback mechanism is introduced to guide\nthe reconstruction of high-resolution images. The deep sub-network learns from\nthe residuals of the high-frequency image information, where multiple residual\nblocks are cascaded to magnify the MRI images at the last network layer.\nFinally, the features from the shallow and deep sub-networks are fused for the\nreconstruction of high-resolution MRI images. For effective fusion of features\nfrom the deep and shallow sub-networks, a step-wise connection (CPRN S) is\ndesigned as inspired by the human cognitive processes (from simple to complex).\nExperiments over three public MRI datasets show that our proposed CPRN achieves\nsuperior MRI super-resolution performance as compared with the\nstate-of-the-art.

Here, by\nbuilding on a scenario with two separated but entangled friends introduced by\nBrukner, we prove that if quantum evolution is controllable on the scale of an\nobserver, then one of 'No-Superdeterminism', 'Locality' or 'Absoluteness of\nObserved Events' -- that every observed event exists absolutely, not relatively\n-- must be false. We show that although the violation of Bell-type inequalities\nin such scenarios is not in general sufficient to demonstrate the contradiction\nbetween those three assumptions, new inequalities can be derived in a\ntheory-independent manner, that are violated by quantum correlations.

In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can fully exploit\nthe GPU parallelism with their feedforward architectures. However, little\nattention has been paid to performing NER with CNNs, mainly owing to their\ndifficulties in capturing the long-term context information in a sequence. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple but effective CNN-based network for NER, i.e.,\ngated relation network (GRN), which is more capable than common CNNs in\ncapturing long-term context. Specifically, in GRN we firstly employ CNNs to\nexplore the local context features of each word. Then we model the relations\nbetween words and use them as gates to fuse local context features into global\nones for predicting labels. Without using recurrent layers that process a\nsentence in a sequential manner, our GRN allows computations to be performed in\nparallel across the entire sentence. Experiments on two benchmark NER datasets\n(i.e., CoNLL2003 and Ontonotes 5.0) show that, our proposed GRN can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance with or without external knowledge.

Since biopsies are burdensome, patients do not always comply with\nthe schedule, which increases the risk of delayed detection of cancer\nprogression.\n  Objective: Our aim is to better balance the number of biopsies (burden) and\nthe delay in detection of cancer progression (less is beneficial), by\npersonalizing the decision of conducting biopsies.\n  Data Sources: We use patient data of the world's largest active surveillance\nprogram (PRIAS). It enrolled 5270 patients, had 866 cancer progressions, and an\naverage of nine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and five digital rectal\nexamination (DRE) measurements per patient.\n  Methods: Using joint models for time-to-event and longitudinal data, we model\nthe historical DRE and PSA measurements, and biopsy results of a patient at\neach follow-up visit.

However,\nthe delay in detection of progression (years) is similar for the personalized\n(median: 0.7, IQR: 0.3-1.0) and the annual schedule (median: 0.5, IQR:\n0.3-0.8).\n  Conclusions: We conclude that personalized schedules provide substantially\nbetter balance in the number of biopsies per detected progression for men with\nlow-risk prostate cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 08:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

In a first step, we study the single-scattering problem for\npoint-like objects in the Born approximation. Using the assumption that the\nphase of body waves is randomized by surface reflection or by interaction with\nthe scatterers, we show that it becomes possible to define, in the usual\nmanner, the cross-sections for surface-to-body and body-to-surface scattering.\nAdopting the independent scattering approximation, we then define the\nscattering mean free paths of body and surface waves including the coupling\nbetween the two types of waves.

To solve\nthis puzzle, we examine the $K^-$ optical potential in the linear density\napproximation and determine the potential parameters of each kaonic atom so as\nto reproduce the observed energy shift and absorption width. We find two types\nof the potentials. One potential has a so large real part as to provide nuclear\nstates with the same quantum number to the atomic state in the last orbit. The\nlevel repulsion between the atomic state and the nuclear states takes place due\nto their mixing, and it makes the atomic state shifted repulsively.

We find that only the latter solution reproduce\na wide of the observed data, and thus is realized as a $K^-$-nucleus potential\nfor kaonic atom. In the linear nuclear density optical potential, the picture\nthat the repulsive shifts in the atomic states stem from the existence of the\nnuclear states does not globally stand up.

The key idea is to\nrepresent videos by compressing them in the form of realistic images, which can\nbe used in a variety of video-based scene analysis applications. Representing a\nvideo as a single image enables us to address the problem of video analysis by\nimage analysis techniques. To this end, we exploit a 3D convolutional\nencoder-decoder network to encode the input video as an image by minimizing the\nreconstruction error. Furthermore, weak supervision by an adversarial training\nprocedure is imposed on the output of the encoder to generate semantically\nrealistic images.

The success of this\nregularization approach heavily depends on the accurate tuning of two\nparameters (namely, the Tikhonov parameter and the dimension of the projection\nsubspace): these are simultaneously set using new strategies that can be\nregarded as special instances of bilevel optimization methods, which are solved\nby using a new paradigm that interlaces the iterations performed to project the\nTikhonov problem (lower-level problem) with those performed to apply a given\nparameter choice rule (higher-level problem). The discrepancy principle, the\nGCV, the quasi-optimality criterion, and Regi\\'{n}ska criterion can all be\nadapted to work in this framework. The links between Gauss quadrature and\nGolub-Kahan bidiagonalization are exploited to prove convergence results for\nthe discrepancy principle, and to give insight into the behavior of the other\nconsidered regularization parameter choice rules.

Using the mapping to the\ndirected polymer in a random potential at high temperature, we obtain\n\"snapshots\" of the optimal paths in Monte-Carlo simulations which probe the\ntails with an importance sampling algorithm. For each tail we observe a very\nnarrow \"tube\" of height profiles around a single optimal path which agrees with\nthe analytical prediction. The agreement holds even at long times, supporting\nearlier assertions of the validity of the OFM in the tails well beyond the\nweak-noise limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 11:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 08:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

We show that,\non the one hand, this problem cannot be solved using a nontrivially sublinear\n(in $m$) number of samples: $m^{1-o(1)}$ samples are needed. On the other hand,\na surprisingly space efficient algorithm for processing the samples exists:\n$O(\\log^2 n)$ bits of space suffice to compute an estimate.\n  Our main technical tool is a new peeling type algorithm for matching that we\nsimulate using a recursive sampling process that crucially ensures that local\nneighborhood information from `dense' regions of the graph is provided at\nappropriately higher sampling rates.

Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams.

However, as for\nmulti-label learning tasks, the supervision part of GCN simply minimizes the\ncross-entropy loss between the last layer outputs and the ground-truth label\ndistribution, which tends to lose some useful information such as label\ncorrelations, so that prevents from obtaining high performance. In this paper,\nwe pro-pose a novel GCN-based semi-supervised learning approach for multi-label\nclassification, namely ML-GCN. ML-GCN first uses a GCN to embed the node\nfeatures and graph topologic information. Then, it randomly generates a label\nmatrix, where each row (i.e., label vector) represents a kind of labels. The\ndimension of the label vector is the same as that of the node vector before the\nlast convolution operation of GCN. That is, all labels and nodes are embedded\nin a uniform vector space. Finally, during the ML-GCN model training, label\nvectors and node vectors are concatenated to serve as the inputs of the relaxed\nskip-gram model to detect the node-label correlation as well as the label-label\ncorrelation. Experimental results on several graph classification datasets show\nthat the proposed ML-GCN outperforms four state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

However, little\neffort has been made to investigate how DNN-based image retrieval models are\naffected by such attacks. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Adversarial\nAttacks with Generative Adversarial Networks (UAA-GAN) to attack deep\nfeature-based image retrieval systems. UAA-GAN is an unsupervised learning\nmodel that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once\ntrained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form\nadversarial queries. The core idea is to ensure that the attached perturbation\nis barely perceptible to human yet effective in pushing the query away from its\noriginal position in the deep feature space. UAA-GAN works with various\napplication scenarios that are based on deep features, including image\nretrieval, person Re-ID and face search. Empirical results show that UAA-GAN\ncripples retrieval performance without significant visual changes in the query\nimages. UAA-GAN generated adversarial examples are less distinguishable because\nthey tend to incorporate subtle perturbations in textured or salient areas of\nthe images, such as key body parts of human, dominant structural\npatterns/textures or edges, rather than in visually insignificant areas (e.g.,\nbackground and sky). Such tendency indicates that the model indeed learned how\nto toy with both image retrieval systems and human eyes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 15:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

This\n\"Girls' Coding Week\" was designed as an off-school event and took place during\nsummer 2018 with 13 girls between 11 to 14 years old. To explain the basic\nsteps of programming and to create personalized games, the visual coding app\nPocket Code, an app developed at Graz University of Technology, was used. The\ngirls created their own games with the help of a storyboard after receiving all\nimportant information about coding.

The findings show that gaming elements\nfemale teenagers tend to like, create, and play, mostly follow stereotypical\nexpectations. In contrast to our experiences in heterogeneous course settings,\nthis was not seen as something negative by girls. Furthermore, the findings\nprovided evidence for game-making environments for girls. Subsequently, the\nresults contributed to the development of new featured games to be used in our\napp to inspire female users around the world to code their own games.

Approaches utilizing tensor decompositions\nfor data compression have already been proposed. Here, data on a structured\ngrid is stored as a tensor which is then subjected to appropriate decomposition\nin suitable tensor formats. Such decompositions are based on generalization of\nsingular value decomposition to tensors and capture essential features in the\ndata with storage cost lower by orders of magnitude. However, tensor based data\ncompression is limited by the fact that one can only consider scientific data\nrepresented on structured grids. In case of data on unstructured meshes, we\npropose to consider data as realizations of a function that is based on\nfunctional view of the tensor thus avoiding such limitations. The key is to\nefficiently estimate the parameters of the function whose complexity is small\ncompared to the cardinality of the dataset (otherwise there is no compression).\nHere, we introduce the set of functional sparse Tucker tensors and propose a\nmethod to construct approximation in this set such that the resulting compact\nfunctional tensor can be rapidly evaluated to recover the original data. The\ncompression procedure consists of three steps. In the first step, we consider a\nfraction of the original dataset for interpolation on a structured grid\nfollowed by sequentially truncated higher order singular value decomposition to\nget a compressed version of the interpolated data.We then fit singular vectors\non a set of functional basis using sparse approximation to obtain corresponding\nfunctional sparse Tucker tensor representation. Finally, we re-evaluate the\ncoefficients of this functional tensor using randomized least squares at a\nreduced computational complexity. This strategy leads to compression ratio of\norders of magnitude on combustion simulation datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 20:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

The\ntraining of the policy by reinforcement learning, however, is placed in an\nenvironment. In many real-world applications, however, the policy training in\nthe real environment can cause an unbearable cost, due to the exploration in\nthe environment. Environment reconstruction from the past data is thus an\nappealing way to release the power of reinforcement learning in these\napplications. The reconstruction of the environment is, basically, to extract\nthe casual effect model from the data. However, real-world applications are\noften too complex to offer fully observable environment information. Therefore,\nquite possibly there are unobserved confounding variables lying behind the\ndata. The hidden confounder can obstruct an effective reconstruction of the\nenvironment. In this paper, by treating the hidden confounder as a hidden\npolicy, we propose a deconfounded multi-agent environment reconstruction\n(DEMER) approach in order to learn the environment together with the hidden\nconfounder. DEMER adopts a multi-agent generative adversarial imitation\nlearning framework. It proposes to introduce the confounder embedded policy,\nand use the compatible discriminator for training the policies. We then apply\nDEMER in an application of driver program recommendation. We firstly use an\nartificial driver program recommendation environment, abstracted from the real\napplication, to verify and analyze the effectiveness of DEMER. We then test\nDEMER in the real application of Didi Chuxing. Experiment results show that\nDEMER can effectively reconstruct the hidden confounder, and thus can build the\nenvironment better. DEMER also derives a recommendation policy with a\nsignificantly improved performance in the test phase of the real application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 10:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

The design of the scheme is to maximize\nthe overall throughput of the low-priority users while guaranteeing the quality\nof service of the high-priority users.

However, they lack effective ways\nto adapt to changes in the target object's appearance, making their tracking\naccuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a dynamic\nmemory network to adapt the template to the target's appearance variations\nduring tracking. The reading and writing process of the external memory is\ncontrolled by an LSTM network with the search feature map as input. A spatial\nattention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential\ntarget as the location of the target is at first unknown. To prevent aggressive\nmodel adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the\namount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template.\nIn order to alleviate the drift problem, we also design a \"negative\" memory\nunit that stores templates for distractors, which are used to cancel out wrong\nresponses from the object template. To further boost the tracking performance,\nan auxiliary classification loss is added after the feature extractor part.\nUnlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object's information is\nmaintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires\nexpensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely\nfeed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance changes by updating the\nexternal memory. Moreover, the capacity of our model is not determined by the\nnetwork size as with other trackers --- the capacity can be easily enlarged as\nthe memory requirements of a task increase, which is favorable for memorizing\nlong-term object information.

The task in MAPF is to navigate agents in an undirected\ngraph in a non-colliding way so that each agent eventually reaches its unique\ngoal vertex. At most one agent can reside in a vertex at a time. Agents can\nmove instantaneously by traversing edges provided the movement does not result\nin a collision. Recently attempts to solve MAPF optimally w.r.t. the\nsum-of-costs or the makespan based on the reduction of MAPF to propositional\nsatisfiability (SAT) have appeared. The most successful methods rely on\nbuilding the propositional encoding for the given MAPF instance lazily by a\nprocess inspired in the SMT paradigm. The integration of satisfiability testing\nby the SAT solver and the high-level construction of the encoding is however\nrelatively loose in existing methods. Therefore the ultimate goal of research\nin this direction is to build the DPLL(MAPF) algorithm, a MAPF solver where the\nconstruction of the encoding is fully integrated with the underlying SAT\nsolver.

For sports learning and training, video replay is often used in\npost-match review and training review for tactical analysis and movement\nanalysis. For automatically and systematically competition data collection and\ntactical analysis, a project called CoachAI has been supported by the Ministry\nof Science and Technology, Taiwan. The proposed project also includes research\nof data visualization, connected training auxiliary devices, and data\nwarehouse. Deep learning techniques will be used to develop video-based\nreal-time microscopic competition data collection based on broadcast\ncompetition video. Machine learning techniques will be used to develop a\ntactical analysis. To reveal data in more understandable forms and to help in\npre-match training, AR/VR techniques will be used to visualize data, tactics,\nand so on. In addition, training auxiliary devices including smart badminton\nrackets and connected serving machines will be developed based on the IoT\ntechnology to further utilize competition data and tactical data and boost\ntraining efficiency. Especially, the connected serving machines will be\ndeveloped to perform specified tactics and to interact with players in their\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 08:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Especially for time-series data, which is common in Activity\nRecognition, synchronizing several independently recorded sensors is\nchallenging. Adding second level evidence, like video recordings from multiple\nangles and time-coded annotations, further complicates the matter of curating\nsuch data. A possible alternative is to make use of standardized multi-media\nformats. Sensor data can be encoded in audio format, and time-coded\ninformation, like annotations, as subtitles. Video data can be added easily.\nAll this media can be merged into a single container file, which makes the\nissue of synchronization explicit. The incurred performance overhead by this\nencoding is shown to be negligible and compression can be applied to optimize\nstorage and transmission overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

We analytically develop\ncriteria for the pulse characteristics leading to the effective halting of the\nramified electrodeposits grown during extensive time scales beyond inter-ionic\ncollisions. Our framework is based on the competitive interplay between\ndiffusion and electromigration and tracks the gradient of ionic concentration\nthroughout the entire cycle of pulse-rest as a critical measure for\nheterogeneous evolution. In particular, the framework incorporates the Brownian\nmotion of the ions and investigates the role of the geometry of the\nelectrodeposition interface. Our novel experimental observations verify the\nanalytical developments, where the the dimension-free developments allows the\napplication to the electrochemical systems of various scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}
