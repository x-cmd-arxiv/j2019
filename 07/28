However, many solid-state qubits with favorable properties lack the\nsingle-shot readout capability. One solution is to use the repetitive\nquantum-non-demolition readout technique, where the qubit is correlated with an\nancilla, which is subsequently read out. The readout fidelity is therefore\nlimited by the back-action on the qubit from the measurement. Traditionally, a\nthreshold method is taken, where only the total photon count is used to\ndiscriminate qubit state, discarding all the information of the back-action\nhidden in the time trace of repetitive readout measurement. Here we show by\nusing machine learning (ML), one obtains higher readout fidelity by taking\nadvantage of the time trace data. ML is able to identify when back-action\nhappened, and correctly read out the original state. Since the information is\nalready recorded (but usually discarded), this improvement in fidelity does not\nconsume additional experimental time, and could be directly applied to\npreparation-by-measurement and quantum metrology applications involving\nrepetitive readout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2019 16:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

Using the clover discretization of the\nfield strength tensor, a calculation using a fixed linear combination of\nstandard and hybrid interpolators can be done using the same number of quark\npropagators as a standard calculation, making this a cost-effective option.

The approach expresses the time-dependent density matrix in an\nexponential ansatz and describes time-evolution along the Keldysh path contour.\nA distinct advantage of the approach is exact trace-preservation as a function\nof time, ensuring conservation of probability and particle number. Furthermore,\nthe method avoids the computation of correlated bra-states, simplifying the\ncomputational implementation. We develop the method in a thermal quasi-particle\nrepresentation, which allows seamless connection to the projection method and\ndiagrammatic techniques of the traditional coupled-cluster formalism. For\ncomparison, we also apply the thermo-field framework to renormalization-group\nmethods to obtain reference results for closed and open systems at finite\ntemperatures. We test the singles and doubles approximation to the\ndensity-matrix coupled-cluster method on the correlated electronic dynamics of\nthe single-impurity Anderson model, demonstrating that the new method\nsuccessfully captures the correlated dynamics of both closed systems at finite\ntemperature and driven-dissipative open systems.

Dynamic network embedding aims to learn low dimensional embeddings for\nunseen and seen nodes by using any currently available snapshots of a dynamic\nnetwork. For seen nodes, the existing methods either treat them equally\nimportant or focus on the $k$ most affected nodes at each time step. However,\nthe former solution is time-consuming, and the later solution that relies on\nincoming changes may lose the global topology---an important feature for\ndownstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic network\nembedding method called DynWalks, which includes two key components: 1) An\nonline network embedding framework that can dynamically and efficiently learn\nembeddings based on the selected nodes; 2) A novel online node selecting scheme\nthat offers the flexible choices to balance global topology and recent changes,\nas well as to fulfill the real-time constraint if needed. The empirical studies\non six real-world dynamic networks under three different slicing ways show that\nDynWalks significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in graph\nreconstruction tasks, and obtains comparable results in link prediction tasks.\nFurthermore, the wall-clock time and complexity analysis demonstrate its\nexcellent time and space efficiency.

We introduce\nMax-and-Smooth, an approximate Bayesian inference scheme for a flexible class\nof latent Gaussian models (LGMs) where one or more of the likelihood parameters\nare modeled by latent additive Gaussian processes. Max-and-Smooth consists of\ntwo-steps. In the first step (Max), the likelihood function is approximated by\na Gaussian density with mean and covariance equal to either (a) the maximum\nlikelihood estimate and the inverse observed information, respectively, or (b)\nthe mean and covariance of the normalized likelihood function. In the second\nstep (Smooth), the latent parameters and hyperparameters are inferred and\nsmoothed with the approximated likelihood function. The proposed method ensures\nthat the uncertainty from the first step is correctly propagated to the second\nstep. Since the approximated likelihood function is Gaussian, the approximate\nposterior density of the latent parameters of the LGM (conditional on the\nhyperparameters) is also Gaussian, thus facilitating efficient posterior\ninference in high dimensions. Furthermore, the approximate marginal posterior\ndistribution of the hyperparameters is tractable, and as a result, the\nhyperparameters can be sampled independently of the latent parameters. In the\ncase of a large number of independent data replicates, sparse precision\nmatrices, and high-dimensional latent vectors, the speedup is substantial in\ncomparison to an MCMC scheme that infers the posterior density from the exact\nlikelihood function.

While these algorithms are fundamentally\ndifferent, both suffer from high variance, low sample efficiency, and\nhyperparameter sensitivity that in practice, make these algorithms a no-go for\ncritical operations in the industry.\n  On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning focuses on learning the\ntransition dynamics between states in an environment.

In addition,\nwe discuss and account for several calibration-related systematic errors that\naffect measurements made using frequency-domain multiplexing readout\nelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2019 20:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Our work is unique in that it takes physical and cognitive\nlimitations of the oracle into account when selecting sensor data to be\nannotated by the oracle. Our approach is inspired by human-beings' limited\ncapacity to respond to external stimulus such as responding to a prompt on\ntheir mobile devices. This capacity constraint is manifested not only in the\nnumber of queries that a person can respond to in a given time-frame but also\nin the lag between the time that a query is made and when it is responded to.\nWe introduce the notion of mindful active learning and propose a computational\nframework, called EMMA, to maximize the active learning performance taking\ninformativeness of sensor data, query budget, and human memory into account. We\nformulate this optimization problem, propose an approach to model memory\nretention, discuss complexity of the problem, and propose a greedy heuristic to\nsolve the problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three\npublicly available datasets and by simulating oracles with various memory\nstrengths. We show that the activity recognition accuracy ranges from 21% to\n97% depending on memory strength, query budget, and difficulty of the machine\nlearning task. Our results also indicate that EMMA achieves an accuracy level\nthat is, on average, 13.5% higher than the case when only informativeness of\nthe sensor data is considered for active learning. Additionally, we show that\nthe performance of our approach is at most 20% less than experimental\nupper-bound and up to 80% higher than experimental lower-bound. We observe that\nmindful active learning is most beneficial when query budget is small and/or\noracle's memory is weak, thus emphasizing contributions of our work in\nhuman-centered mobile health settings and for elderly with cognitive\nimpairments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 02:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

However, a substantial performance gap exists between DRAM\nand DCPMM. In our experiments, the read/write latencies of DCPMM were 400% and\n407% higher than those of DRAM, respectively. The read/write bandwidths were\n37% and 8% of those of DRAM. This performance gap in main memory presents a new\nchallenge to researchers; we need a new system software technology supporting\nemerging hybrid memory architecture.

It provides\ngreat flexibility in memory management and maximizes the performance of virtual\nmachines (VMs) by dynamically optimizing memory mappings.

Such approaches are more practical for real-world widespread\ndeployment given that they don't require on-site training (as with unsupervised\nor domain transfer approaches) or on-site manual annotation and training (as\nwith supervised approaches). In this study, we take a systematic approach to\nestablishing a large baseline source domain and target domain for cross-domain\nperson ReID. We accomplish this by conducting a comprehensive analysis to study\nthe similarities between source domains proposed in literature, and studying\nthe effects of incrementally increasing the size of the source domain.

In\naddition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds of robustness. This\nrobustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed to\ndisturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels\nin living systems. Both function and robustness have been acquired through\nevolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized in living systems are rare among all\npossible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape of GRNs and\ninvestigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy\nmodel of GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the\nexpression level of the output gene between two input states, \"on\" and \"off\",\nwas considered as fitness. Thus, the determination of the fitness of a GRN was\nbased on how sensitively it responded to the input.We employed the\nmulticanonical Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide\nrange of fitness levels, and classified the GRNs according to their fitness.\nThe following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited bistability\nfor intermediate input between \"on\" and \"off\". This means that such GRNs\nresponded to two input states by using different fixed points of dynamics. This\nbistability emerges necessarily as fitness increases.

We present an asymptotically\ncompatible (AC) RK collocation method for nonlocal diffusion models with\nDirichlet boundary condition. The scheme is shown to be convergent to both\nnonlocal diffusion and its corresponding local limit as nonlocal interaction\nvanishes. The analysis is carried out on a special family of rectilinear\nCartesian grids for linear RK method with designed kernel support. The key idea\nfor the stability of the RK collocation scheme is to compare the collocation\nscheme with the standard Galerkin scheme which is stable. In addition, there is\na large computational cost for assembling the stiffness matrix of the nonlocal\nproblem because high order Gaussian quadrature is usually needed to evaluate\nthe integral. We thus provide a remedy to the problem by introducing a\nquasi-discrete nonlocal diffusion operator for which no numerical quadrature is\nfurther needed after applying the RK collocation scheme. The quasi-discrete\nnonlocal diffusion operator combined with RK collocation is shown to be\nconvergent to the correct local diffusion problem by taking the limits of\nnonlocal interaction and spatial resolution simultaneously. The theoretical\nresults are then validated with numerical experiments.

The Usadel equations were solved to obtain the quasiparticle density\nof states (DOS) and the low-frequency surface resistance $R_s$ as functions of\nthe RF field amplitude $H_0$. It is shown that the interplay of the broadening\nof the DOS peaks and a decrease of a quasiparticle gap caused by the RF\ncurrents produces a minimum in $R_s(H_0)$ and an extended rise of the quality\nfactor $Q(H_0)$ with the RF field. Paramagnetic impurities shift the minimum in\n$R_s(H_0)$ to lower fields and can reduce $R_s(H_0)$ in a wide range of $H_0$.\nSubgap states in the DOS can give rise to a residual surface resistance while\nreducing $R_s$ at higher temperatures. A proximity-coupled normal layer at the\nsurface can shift the minimum in $R_s(H_0)$ to either low and high fields and\ncan reduce $R_s$ below that of an ideal surface. The theory shows that the\nbehavior of $R_s(H_0)$ changes as the temperature and the RF frequency are\nincreased, and the field dependence of $Q(H_0)$ can be very sensitive to the\nmaterials processing.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be improved\nsubstantially through the use of link prediction models and dense latent\nrepresentations of the underlying argument and relations. This variant, denoted\nProbL, improves the state of the art on our evaluation dataset to 0.8143. In\naddition to developing a new framework and providing novel scores of relational\nimplication, we provide two pragmatic resources to assist future research.\nFirst, we motivate and develop an improved crowd framework for constructing\nlabelled datasets of relational implication. Using this, we reannotate and make\npublic a dataset comprised of 17,848 instances of labelled relational\nimplication. We demonstrate that precision (as evaluated by expert consensus\nwith the crowd labels) on the resulting dataset improves from 53% to 95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 08:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

Conventional authentication and authorization\nschemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to\ntheir reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity\nfor improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for\ndifferent layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead\nto cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and\noverhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled\nsecurity provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast\nauthentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a\nlightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring\nmachine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or\nfrequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic\nauthentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and\ntrust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and\nachieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish\nthe connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security\nprogressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks\nare well-controlled in large-scale IoT.

These plasmas\nare subject to both the beam and the electron cyclotron maser (ECM)\ninstabilities driven by the positive momentum gradient of the ring-beam\nelectron distribution in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the\nambient magnetic field, respectively. To explore the related kinetic processes\nself-consistently, 2.5-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations were carried out. To quantify excited wave properties in different\ncoronal conditions, we investigated the dependence of their energy and\npolarization on the ring-beam electron density and magnetic field. In general,\nelectrostatic waves dominate the energetics of waves and nonlinear waves are\nubiquitous. In weakly magnetized plasmas, where the electron cyclotron\nfrequency $\\omega_{ce}$ is lower than the electron plasma frequency\n$\\omega_{pe}$, it is difficult to produce escaping electromagnetic waves with\nfrequency $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$ and small refractive index $|c k / \\omega| <\n1$ ($k$ and $c$ are the wavenumber and the light speed, respectively). Highly\npolarized and anisotropic escaping electromagnetic waves can, however, be\neffectively excited in strongly magnetized plasmas with\n$\\omega_{ce}/\\omega_{pe} \\geq 1$. The anisotropy of the energy, circular\npolarization degree (CPD), and spectrogram of these escaping electromagnetic\nwaves strongly depend on the number density ratio of the ring-beam electrons to\nthe background electrons. In particular, their CPDs can vary from left-handed\nto right-handed with the decrease of the ring-beam density, which may explain\nsome observed properties of solar radio bursts (e.g., radio spikes) from the\nsolar corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 14:57:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 16:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

In\nthese problems, objective evaluations are usually inaccurate, because noise is\nalmost inevitable in real world, and it is a crucial issue to weaken the\nnegative effect caused by noise. Sampling is a popular strategy, which\nevaluates the objective a couple of times, and employs the mean of these\nevaluation results as an estimate of the objective value. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel sampling method, median sampling, into EAs, and illustrate\nits properties and usefulness theoretically by solving OneMax, the problem of\nmaximizing the number of 1s in a bit string. Instead of the mean, median\nsampling employs the median of the evaluation results as an estimate. Through\nrigorous theoretical analysis on OneMax under the commonly used onebit noise,\nwe show that median sampling reduces the expected runtime exponentially. Next,\nthrough two special noise models, we show that when the 2-quantile of the noisy\nfitness increases with the true fitness, median sampling can be better than\nmean sampling; otherwise, it may fail and mean sampling can be better. The\nresults may guide us to employ median sampling properly in practical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 11:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 09:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}
