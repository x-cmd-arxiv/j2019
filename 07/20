Several theories suggest\nthat pairs of DM particles can annihilate into a flash of light at gamma-ray\nwavelengths. While gamma-ray emission has been observed from environments where\nDM is expected to accumulate, such as the centre of our Galaxy, other high\nenergy sources can create a contaminating astrophysical gamma-ray background,\nthus making DM detection difficult. In principle, dwarf galaxies around the\nMilky Way are a better place to look -- they contain a greater fraction of DM\nwith no astrophysical gamma-ray background -- but they are too distant for\ngamma-rays to have been seen. A range of observational evidence suggests that\nOmega Centauri (omega Cen or NGC 5139), usually classified as the Milky Way's\nlargest globular cluster, is really the core of a captured and stripped dwarf\ngalaxy. Importantly, Omega Cen is ten times closer to us than known dwarfs.\nHere we show that not only does Omega Cen contain DM with density as high as\ncompact dwarf galaxies, but also that it emits gamma-rays with an energy\nspectrum matching that expected from the annihilation of DM particles with mass\n31$\\pm$4 GeV (68\\% confidence limit).

This study\nshows that performance-aware test case generation requires solving two main\nchallenges: providing a good approximation of resource usage with minimal\noverhead and avoiding detrimental effects on both final coverage and fault\ndetection effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, we conceived a set of\nperformance proxies -- inspired by previous work on performance testing -- that\nprovide a reasonable estimation of the test execution costs (i.e., runtime and\nmemory usage).

Our empirical study -- involving 110 non-trivial\nJava classes -- reveals that our adaptive approach generates test suite with\nstatistically significant improvements in runtime (-25%) and heap memory\nconsumption (-15%) compared to DynaMOSA.

Recently, deep-learning-based bug localization\nmodels have been proposed in the literature, which show a better performance\nthan the state-of-the-art models.\n  Aim: In this research, we would like to investigate whether deep learning\nmodels meet the expectations of practitioners or not.\n  Method: We constructed a Convolution Neural Network and a Simple Logistic\nmodel to examine their effectiveness in localizing bugs. We train these models\non five open source projects written in Java and compare their performance with\nthe performance of other state-of-the-art models trained on these datasets.\n  Results: Our experiments show that although the deep learning models perform\nbetter than classic machine learning models, they meet the adoption criteria\nset by the practitioners only partially.\n  Conclusions: This work provides evidence that the practitioners should be\ncautious while using the current state of the art models for production-level\nuse-cases. It also highlights the need for standardization of performance\nbenchmarks to ensure that bug localization models are assessed equitably and\nrealistically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 17:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

Motivated by this question we introduce programmable and\ninterpretable regression networks for pattern recognition and address mode\ndecomposition as a prototypical problem. The programming of these networks is\nachieved by assembling elementary modules decomposing and recomposing kernels\nand data. These elementary steps are repeated across levels of abstraction and\ninterpreted from the equivalent perspectives of optimal recovery, game theory\nand Gaussian process regression (GPR). The prototypical mode/kernel\ndecomposition module produces an optimal approximation $(w_1,w_2,\\cdots,w_m)$\nof an element $(v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_m)$ of a product of Hilbert subspaces of a\ncommon Hilbert space from the observation of the sum $v:=v_1+\\cdots+v_m$. The\nprototypical mode/kernel recomposition module performs partial sums of the\nrecovered modes $w_i$ based on the alignment between each recovered mode $w_i$\nand the data $v$.

The sparse activity of Kenyon\ncells, the principal neurons in the mushroom body, plays a key role in the\nlearned classification of different odours. In the specific case of the fruit\nfly, the sparseness of the network is enforced by an inhibitory feedback neuron\ncalled APL, and by an intrinsic high firing threshold of the Kenyon cells. In\nthis work we took inspiration from the fruit fly brain to formulate a novel\nmachine learning algorithm that is able to optimize the sparsity level of a\nreservoir by changing the firing thresholds of the nodes. The sparsity is only\napplied on the readout layer so as not to change the timescales of the\nreservoir and to allow the derivation of a one-layer update rule for the firing\nthresholds. The proposed algorithm is a combination of learning a\nneuron-specific sparsity threshold via gradient descent and a global sparsity\nthreshold via a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed model outperforms\nthe standard gradient descent, which is limited to the readout weights of the\nreservoir, on two example tasks. It demonstrates how the learnt sparse\nrepresentation can lead to better classification performance, memorization\nability and convergence time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 17:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

A major obstacle comes in the form of lensing\ndegeneracies, such as the mass sheet degeneracy (MSD), which make it possible\nfor a family of density profiles to reproduce the same lensing observables but\nreturn different values of $H_0$. The modeling process artificially selects one\nchoice from this family, potentially biasing $H_0$. The effect is more\npronounced when the profile of a given lens is not perfectly described by the\nlens model, which will always be the case to some extent. To explore this, we\nquantify the bias and spread in $H_0$ by creating quads from two-component mass\nmodels and fitting them with a power-law ellipse+shear model. We find that the\nbias does not correspond to the estimate one would calculate by transforming\nthe profile into a power law near the image radius. We also emulate the effect\nof including stellar kinematics by performing fits where the slope is\nconstrained to the true value. Informing the fit using the true value near the\nimage radius can introduce substantial bias (0-23% depending on the model). We\nconfirm using Jeans arguments that kinematic constraints can result in a biased\nvalue of $H_0$, though the degree of bias depends on the region kinematic\nmodeling probes in specific lenses. We conclude that lensing degeneracies\nmanifest through commonplace modeling approaches in a more complicated way than\nis assumed in the literature.

This pilot work conducts a subjective study to compare\nthese two approaches to sound search, and tries to answer the question of which\napproach works better for what kinds of sounds. To do so, we developed two\nweb-based search engines for sound, one by vocal imitation (Vroom!) and the\nother by text description (TextSearch).

A recently developed mapping approach is generalised to use a more\nadvanced solar wind model that includes the effects of solar wind acceleration,\nnon-radial intrinsic magnetic fields and flows at the source surface/inner\nboundary, and conservation of angular momentum. The field lines are mapped by\nstepping along local magnetic field $\\bm{B}$ and via a Runge-Kutta algorithm,\nleading to essentially identical maps. The new model's maps for Carrington\nrotation CR 1895 near solar minimum (19 April to 15 May 1995) and a solar\nrotation between CR 2145 and CR 2146 near solar maximum (14 January to 9\nFebruary 2014) are compared with the published maps for a constant solar wind\nmodel. The two maps are very similar on a large scale near both solar minimum\nand solar maximum, meaning that the field line orientations, winding angles,\nand connectivity generally agree very well. However, close inspection shows\nthat the field lines have notable small-scale structural differences. An\ninterpretation is that inclusion of the acceleration and intrinsic azimuthal\nvelocity has significant effects on the local structure of the magnetic field\nlines. Interestingly, the field lines are more azimuthal for the accelerating\nsolar wind model for both intervals. In addition, predictions for the pitch\nangle distributions (PADs) for suprathermal electrons agree at the $90$ --\n$95\\%$ level with observations for both solar wind models for both intervals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 20:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Since\nthe early realizations of SPDC, researchers have thought to generalize it to\nhigher order, e.g., to produce entangled photon triplets. However, directly\ngenerating photon triplets through a single SPDC process has remained elusive.\nHere, using a flux-pumped superconducting parametric cavity, we demonstrate\ndirect three-photon SPDC, with photon triplets generated in a single cavity\nmode or split between multiple modes. With strong pumping, the states can be\nquite bright, with flux densities exceeding 60 photon/s/Hz. The observed states\nare strongly non-Gaussian, which has important implications for potential\napplications. In the single-mode case, we observe a triangular star-shaped\ndistribution of quadrature voltages, indicative of the long-predicted \"star\nstate\". The observed star state shows strong third-order correlations, as\nexpected for a state generated by a cubic Hamiltonian. By pumping at the sum\nfrequency of multiple modes, we observe strong three-body correlations between\nmultiple modes, strikingly, in the absence of second-order correlations. We\nfurther analyze the third-order correlations under mode transformations by the\nsymplectic symmetry group, showing that the observed transformation properties\nserve to \"fingerprint\" the specific cubic Hamiltonian that generates them. The\nobserved non-Gaussian, third-order correlations represent an important step\nforward in quantum optics and may have a strong impact on quantum communication\nwith microwave fields as well as continuous-variable quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 21:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Elementary interactions are self-contained information requests that can\nbe answered with little cognitive effort, which are made and processed with the\nhelp of a web platform. Each elementary interaction contributes to the stepwise\ndevelopment of a SOO. Based on the hypothesis that a SOO can be developed\nexclusively with elementary interactions, a platform concept is described.\nEssential components of the platform are a Model Aggregator, an Elementary\nInteraction Stream Generator, a Participant Manager and a Discussion Forum.

Here, we demonstrate an approach to improve the\naccuracy of global PES without increasing the number of energy points. The\npresent work reports four important results. First, we show that the selection\nof the best kernel function for GP models of PES can be automated using the\nBayesian information criterion as a model selection metric.

A multiway $k$-cut problem requires partitioning the set of nodes in\na graph into $k$ subsets, such that each subset contains one prespecified node,\nand the corresponding total cut weight is minimized. These problems arise in\nmany applications and are computationally complex (NP-hard). In the static\nsetting this article presents an approach that uses a relaxed multiway $k$-cut\ncost function; we show that the resulting algorithm converges to a local\nminimum. This iterative algorithm is designed to avoid poor local minima with\nits run-time complexity as $\\sim O(kIN^3)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices\nand $I$ is the number of iterations. In the dynamic setting, the edge-weight\nmatrix has an associated dynamics with some of the edges in the graph capable\nof being influenced by an external input. The objective is to design the\ndynamics of the controllable edges so that multiway $k$-cut value remains small\n(or decreases) as the graph evolves under the dynamics. Also it is required to\ndetermine the time-varying partition that defines the minimum multiway $k$-cut\nvalue. Our approach is to choose a relaxation of multiway $k$-cut value,\nderived using maximum entropy principle, and treat it as a control Lyapunov\nfunction to design control laws that affect the weight dynamics. Simulations on\npractical examples of interactive foreground-background segmentation, minimum\nmultiway $k$-cut optimization for non-planar graphs and dynamically evolving\ngraphs that demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 22:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

The new discretization thus allows for\nlarge time steps in explicit time integrators, even on very skewed grids. It\nalso applies to the variable-coefficient generalization of the Laplacian.

SA-GPR addresses the limitations of currently available signal\nalignment methods by adopting a hybrid of the particle smoothing and\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to align signals, and by applying\nthe Gaussian process regression to construct profiles to be aligned\ncontinuously. SA-GPR shares all the strengths of the existing alignment\nalgorithms that depend on profiles but is more exact in the sense that profiles\ndo not need to be discretized as sequential bins. The uncertainty of\nperformance over the resolution of such bins is thereby eliminated. This\nmethodology produces alignments that are consistent, that regularize extreme\ncases, and that properly reflect the inherent uncertainty.\n  Then we extend SA-GPR to a specific problem in the field of paleoceanography\nwith a method called Bayesian Inference Gaussian Process Multiproxy Alignment\nof Continuous Signals (BIGMACS). The goal of BIGMACS is to infer continuous\nages for ocean sediment cores using two classes of age proxies: proxies that\nexplicitly return calendar ages (e.g., radiocarbon) and those used to\nsynchronize ages in multiple marine records (e.g., an oxygen isotope based\nmarine proxy known as benthic ${\\delta}^{18}{\\rm O}$). BIGMACS integrates these\ntwo proxies by iteratively performing two steps: profile construction from\nbenthic ${\\delta}^{18}{\\rm O}$ age models and alignment of each core to the\nprofile also reflecting radiocarbon dates. We use BIGMACS to construct a new\nDeep Northeastern Atlantic stack (i.e., a profile from a particular benthic\n${\\delta}^{18}{\\rm O}$ records) of five ocean sediment cores.

Coded caching is a promising approach to addressing these\nchallenges, as it provides abundant opportunities for fronthaul multicast and\ncooperative transmissions. This paper investigates a cache-enabled C-SCNs, in\nwhich small-cell base stations (SBSs) are connected to the central processor\nvia fronthaul, and can prefetch popular contents by applying maximum distance\nseparable (MDS) codes. To fully capture the benefits of fronthaul multicast and\ncooperative transmissions, an MDS codes-aided transmission scheme is first\nproposed. We formulate the problem to minimize the content delivery latency by\njointly optimizing fronthaul bandwidth allocation, SBS clustering, and\nbeamforming. To efficiently solve the resulting nonlinear integer programming\nproblem, we propose a penalty-based design by leveraging variational\nreformulations of binary constraints. To improve the solution of the\npenalty-based design, a greedy SBS clustering design is also developed.\nFurthermore, closed-form characterization of the optimal solution is obtained,\nthrough which the benefits of MDS codes can be quantified. Simulation results\nare given to demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed MDS\ncodes-aided transmission scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 05:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Each UE can choose one of the fog\nnodes to offload its task, and each fog node may serve multiple UEs. Depending\non the computation burden at the fog nodes, the tasks may be computed by the\nfog nodes or further offloaded to the cloud via capacity-limited fronthaul\nlinks. To compute all UEs' tasks as fast as possible, joint optimization of\nUE-Fog association, radio and computation resources of F-RAN is proposed to\nminimize the maximum latency of all UEs. This min-max problem is formulated as\na mixed integer nonlinear program (MINP). We first show that the MINP can be\nreformulated as a continuous optimization problem, and then employ the\nmajorization minimization (MM) approach to find a solution. The MM approach\nthat we develop is unconventional in that -- each MM subproblem can be solved\ninexactly with the same provable convergence guarantee as the conventional\nexact MM, thereby reducing the complexity of each MM iteration. In addition, we\nalso consider a cooperative offloading model, where the fog nodes\ncompress-and-forward their received signals to the cloud. Under this model, a\nsimilar min-max latency optimization problem is formulated and tackled again by\nthe inexact MM approach.

In this process, before the $B^+_c$ meson decays into\ntwo final state mesons of $D^0K^+$, it first decays into two intermediate\nmesons like $J/\\psi D^{*+}_s$, then these two mesons transformed into two final\nmesons by exchanging another meson like $D^0$. The FSI effects are very\nsensitive to the changes in the phenomenological parameter that appear in the\nform factor relation, as in most calculation changing two units in this\nparameter, makes the final result multiply in the branching ratio, therefor the\ndecision to use FSI is not unexpected. In this study there are nineteen\nintermediate states in which the contribution of each one is calculated and\nsummed in the final amplitude. Therefore, the numerical value of the branching\nratio of $B^+_c\\rightarrow D^0K^+$ decay is obtained by calculating the FSI\neffects from $1.17\\times10^{-5}$ to $11.65\\times10^{-5}$ which is consistent\nwith the experimental result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 07:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Designs balancing\ninfrastructure costs and user experience indices require tools from teletraffic\ntheory and operations research. A standard approach to designing such systems\ninvolves formulating optimization problems that strive to maximize the\npertinent utility functions while adhering to quality-of-service and other\nphysical constraints. In many cases, formulating such problems necessitates\nmaking simplistic assumptions on arrival and departure processes to keep the\nproblem simple. This work puts forth a stochastic optimization framework for\ndesigning queuing systems where the exogenous processes may have arbitrary and\nunknown distributions. We show that many such queuing design problems can\ngenerally be formulated as stochastic optimization problems where the objective\nand constraint are non-linear functions of expectations. The compositional\nstructure obviates the use of classical stochastic approximation approaches\nwhere the stochastic gradients are often required to be unbiased. To this end,\na constrained stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithm is proposed\nthat utilizes a tracking step for the expected value functions. The\nnon-asymptotic performance of the proposed algorithm is characterized via its\niteration complexity. Numerical tests allow us to validate the theoretical\nresults and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 08:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Two instantaneous mixing models are\nconsidered. First, we consider the standard determined mixing model used in\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) where the mixing matrix is square and\nnon-singular and the number of the latent sources is the same as that of the\nobserved signals. The CRLB for Independent Component Extraction (ICE) where the\nmixing matrix is re-parameterized in order to extract only one independent\ntarget source is computed. The target source is assumed to be non-Gaussian or\nnon-circular Gaussian while the other signals (background) are circular\nGaussian or non-Gaussian. The results confirm some previous observations known\nfor the real domain and bring new results for the complex domain. Also, the\nCRLB for ICE is shown to coincide with that for ICA when the non-Gaussianity of\nbackground is taken into account. %unless the assumed sources' distributions\nare misspecified. Second, we extend the CRLB analysis to piecewise determined\nmixing models. Here, the observed signals are assumed to obey the determined\nmixing model within short blocks where the mixing matrices can be varying from\nblock to block. However, either the mixing vector or the separating vector\ncorresponding to the target source is assumed to be constant across the blocks.\nThe CRLBs for the parameters of these models bring new performance bounds for\nthe BSE problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 10:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We have developed a new tool for CME\nAutomatic detection and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The\nsystem is a three-module pipeline. It is first a supervised image\nclassification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet with\ntraining labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing\nCME structures are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in\neach CME-flagged image, we use deep descriptor transforming to localize the\ncommon object in an image set. A following step is to apply the graph cut\ntechnique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image\nsequence, the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from\ncartesian to polar coordinate. A CME event is labeled if it can move in at\nleast two frames and reach the edge of coronagraph field of view. For each\nevent, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four\nrepresentative CMEs with various characteristics are presented and compared\nwith those from four existing automatic and manual catalogs.

Coded matrix multiplication is a recently introduced\ntechnique that enables straggler-resistant distributed multiplication of large\nmatrices. A key property is that the finishing time depends only on the work\ncompleted by a set of the fastest workers, while the work done by the slowest\nworkers is ignored completely. This paper is motivated by the observation that\nin real-world commercial cloud computing systems such as Amazon's Elastic\nCompute Cloud (EC2) the distinction between fast and slow nodes is often a soft\none. Thus, if we could also exploit the work completed by stragglers we may\nrealize substantial performance gains. To realize such gains, in this paper we\nuse the idea of hierarchical coding (Ferdinand and Draper, IEEE Int. Symp. Inf.\nTheory, 2018). We decompose the overall matrix multiplication task into a\nhierarchy of heterogeneously sized subtasks. The duty to complete each subtask\nis shared amongst all workers and each subtask is (generally) of a different\ncomplexity. The motivation for the hierarchical decomposition is the\nrecognition that more workers will finish the first subtask than the second (or\nthird, forth, etc.). Connecting to error correction coding, earlier subtasks\ncan therefore be designed to be of a higher rate than later subtasks. Through\nthis hierarchical design our scheme exploits the work completed by stragglers,\nrather than ignoring it, even if that amount is much less than that completed\nby the fastest workers. We numerically show that our method realizes a 60%\nimprovement in the expected finishing time for a widely studied statistical\nmodel of the speed of computation and, on Amazon EC2, the gain is 35%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 14:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Recently its combination with deep learning has been\nexplored intensely, leading to the development of deep probabilistic\nprogramming languages such as Pyro. At the core of this development lie\ninference engines based on stochastic variational inference algorithms. When\nasked to find information about the posterior distribution of a model written\nin such a language, these algorithms convert this posterior-inference query\ninto an optimisation problem and solve it approximately by gradient ascent. In\nthis paper, we analyse one of the most fundamental and versatile variational\ninference algorithms, called score estimator, using tools from denotational\nsemantics and program analysis. We formally express what this algorithm does on\nmodels denoted by programs, and expose implicit assumptions made by the\nalgorithm. The violation of these assumptions may lead to an undefined\noptimisation objective or the loss of convergence guarantee of the optimisation\nprocess.

For example, the security offered by proof-of-work (PoW) systems,\nlike Bitcoin, is due to spent computation; it is work precisely because it\ncannot be performed for free. In general, more resources provably lost in\nproducing blocks yields more security for the blockchain. When two blockchains\nshare the same mechanism for providing opportunity cost, as is the case when\nthey share the same PoW algorithm, the two chains compete for resources from\nblock producers. Indeed, if there exists a liquid market between resource\ntypes, then theoretically all blockchains will compete for resources. In this\npaper, we show that there exists a resource allocation equilibrium between any\ntwo blockchains, which is essentially driven by the fiat value of reward that\neach chain offers in return for providing security. We go on to prove that this\nequilibrium is singular and always achieved provided that block producers\nbehave in a greedy, but cautious fashion. The opposite is true when they are\noverly greedy: resource allocation oscillates in extremes between the two\nchains. We show that these results hold both in practice and in a block\ngeneration simulation. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of this\ntheory including a trustless price-ratio oracle, increased security for\nblockchains whose coins have lower fiat value, and a quantification of cost to\nallocating resources away from the equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 21:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}
