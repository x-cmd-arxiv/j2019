Established tissue segmentation approaches have\nhowever not been developed to cope with large anatomical changes resulting from\npathology. The effect of the presence of brain lesions, for example, on their\nperformance is thus currently uncontrolled and practically unpredictable.\nContrastingly, with the advent of deep neural networks (DNNs), segmentation of\nbrain lesions has matured significantly and is achieving performance levels\nmaking it of interest for clinical use. However, few existing approaches allow\nfor jointly segmenting normal tissue and brain lesions. Developing a DNN for\nsuch joint task is currently hampered by the fact that annotated datasets\ntypically address only one specific task and rely on a task-specific\nhetero-modal imaging protocol. In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nbuild a joint tissue and lesion segmentation model from task-specific\nhetero-modal and partially annotated datasets. Starting from a variational\nformulation of the joint problem, we show how the expected risk can be\ndecomposed and optimised empirically. We exploit an upper-bound of the risk to\ndeal with missing imaging modalities. For each task, our approach reaches\ncomparable performance than task-specific and fully-supervised models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 18:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

We use a library of hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer\nto explore these biases.

An example is the extraction of the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s$,\nfrom hadronic $\\tau$-decay data, using a variety of analysis methods based on\nfinite-energy sum rules. Here, we reconsider a long-used method, which\nparametrizes non-perturbative contributions to the $I=1$ vector and axial\nvacuum polarizations with the OPE, setting several higher-dimension\ncoefficients to zero in order to implement the method in practice. The\nassumption that doing this has a negligible effect on the value of $\\alpha_s$\nis tantamount to the assumption that the low-dimension part of the OPE\nconverges rapidly with increasing dimension near the $\\tau$ mass.

Interestingly,\nthe axion state has emerged in effective theory of topological insulators and\nhas attracted extensive attention in condensed matter physics. Time-reversal or\ninversion symmetry constrains the axion field $\\theta$ to be quantized. When\nboth the time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken by, say, an\nantiferromagnetic order, the axion field $\\theta$ could become unquantized and\ndynamical along with magnetic fluctuations, which is termed the dynamical axion\nfield. Here, we reveal that a wide class of topological-insulator-based\ndynamical axion states could be distinguished from the normal-insulator-based\nones by a hidden quantity derived from the pseudospin Chern number.

Usually,\nthese methods are based on explicit feature representations, including\nspatio-temporal features, traffic states, etc. Here, we argue that the local\ntraffic condition is closely tied up with the land-use and built environment,\ni.e., metro stations, arterial roads, intersections, commercial area,\nresidential area, and etc, yet the relation is time-varying and too complicated\nto model explicitly and efficiently. Thus, this paper proposes an end-to-end\nmulti-task deep neural model, named Deep Image to Time (DeepI2T), to learn the\ntravel time mainly from the built environment images, a.k.a. the morphological\nlayout images, and showoff the new state-of-the-art performance on real-world\ndatasets in two cities.

Learning domain-invariant features helps to achieve this goal,\nwhereas it underpins unlabeled samples drawn from a single or multiple explicit\ntarget domains (Multi-target DA). In this paper, we consider a more realistic\ntransfer scenario: our target domain is comprised of multiple sub-targets\nimplicitly blended with each other, so that learners could not identify which\nsub-target each unlabeled sample belongs to. This Blending-target Domain\nAdaptation (BTDA) scenario commonly appears in practice and threatens the\nvalidities of most existing DA algorithms, due to the presence of domain gaps\nand categorical misalignments among these hidden sub-targets.\n  To reap the transfer performance gains in this new scenario, we propose\nAdversarial Meta-Adaptation Network (AMEAN). AMEAN entails two adversarial\ntransfer learning processes. The first is a conventional adversarial transfer\nto bridge our source and mixed target domains. To circumvent the intra-target\ncategory misalignment, the second process presents as ``learning to adapt'': It\ndeploys an unsupervised meta-learner receiving target data and their ongoing\nfeature-learning feedbacks, to discover target clusters as our\n``meta-sub-target'' domains. These meta-sub-targets auto-design our\nmeta-sub-target DA loss, which empirically eliminates the implicit category\nmismatching in our mixed target. We evaluate AMEAN and a variety of DA\nalgorithms in three benchmarks under the BTDA setup. Empirical results show\nthat BTDA is a quite challenging transfer setup for most existing DA\nalgorithms, yet AMEAN significantly outperforms these state-of-the-art\nbaselines and effectively restrains the negative transfer effects in BTDA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 02:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Dwarf galaxies (dGs) are important as their low mass makes them more\nsusceptible to these effects than giant systems. Combined luminosity functions\n(LFs) in the r- and u-band of 15 galaxy clusters were constructed using\narchival data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. LFs were measured as a\nfunction of cluster-centric radius from stacked cluster data. Marginal evidence\nwas found for an increase in the faint-end slope of the u-band LF relative to\nthe r-band with increasing cluster-centric radius. The dwarf-to-giant ratio\n(DGR) was found to increase toward the cluster outskirts, with the u-band DGR\nincreasing faster with cluster-centric radius compared to the r-band. The dG\nblue fraction was found to be ~2 times larger than the giant galaxy blue\nfraction over all cluster-centric distance (~5sigma level). The central\nconcentration (C) was used as a proxy to distinguish nucleated versus\nnon-nucleated dGs. The ratio of high-C to low-C dGs was found to be ~2 times\ngreater in the inner cluster region compared to the outskirts (2.8sigma level).\nThe faint-end slope of the r-band LF for the cluster outskirts (0.6 < r/r_200 <\n1.0) is steeper than the SDSS field LF, while the u-band LF is marginally\nsteeper at the 2.5sigma level. Decrease in the faint-end slope of the r- and\nu-band cluster LFs towards the cluster centre is consistent with quenching of\nstar formation via ram pressure stripping and galaxy-galaxy interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 04:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 21:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

It is based on the principle of a superconducting\nresonator circuit. A radiation entering the MKID breaks the Cooper pairs in the\nsuperconducting resonator, and the intensity of the radiation is detected as a\nvariation of the resonant condition. Therefore, calibration of the detector\nresponsivity, i.e., the variation of the resonant phase with respect to the\nnumber of Cooper-pair breaks (quasiparticles), is important. We propose a\nmethod for responsivity calibration. Microwaves used for the detector readout\nlocally raise the temperature in each resonator, which increases the number of\nquasiparticles. Since the magnitude of the temperature rise depends on the\npower of readout microwaves, the number of quasiparticles also depends on the\npower of microwaves. By changing the power of the readout microwaves, we\nsimultaneously measure the phase difference and lifetime of quasiparticles. We\ncalculate the number of quasiparticles from the measured lifetime and by using\na theoretical formula. This measurement yields a relation between the phase\nresponse as a function of the number of quasiparticles. We demonstrate this\nresponsivity calibration using the MKID maintained at 285mK.

To converge in a small number of iterations, however, they\nhave to be coupled with an efficient preconditioner. The efficiency of the\npreconditioner depends largely on its accuracy on the eigenvectors\ncorresponding to small eigenvalues, and unfortunately, black-box methods\ntypically cannot guarantee sufficient accuracy on these eigenvectors. Thus,\nconstructing the preconditioner becomes a problem-dependent task. However, for\na large class of problems, including many elliptic equations, the eigenvectors\ncorresponding to small eigenvalues are smooth functions of the PDE grid. In\nthis paper, we describe a hierarchical approximate factorization approach which\nfocuses on improving accuracy on the smooth eigenvectors. The improved accuracy\nis achieved by preserving the action of the factorized matrix on piecewise\npolynomial functions of the grid. Based on the factorization, we propose a\nfamily of sparse preconditioners with $O(n)$ or $O(n \\log{n})$ construction\ncomplexities.

There are two challenging\nissues when the blockchain is operating in practice. First, the outcomes of the\nconsensus algorithm are usually related to the incentive model, so whether each\nparticipant's value has an equal probability of being chosen becomes essential.\nHowever, the issues of fairness are not captured in the traditional security\ndefinition of Byzantine agreement. Second, the blockchain should be resistant\nto network failures, such as cloud services shut down or malicious attack,\nwhile remains the high performance most of the time.\n  This paper has two main contributions. First, we propose a novel notion\ncalled fair validity for Byzantine agreement. Intuitively, fair validity\nlower-bounds the expected numbers that honest nodes' values being decided if\nthe protocol is executed many times. However, we also show that any Byzantine\nagreement could not achieve fair validity in an asynchronous network, so we\nfocus on synchronous protocols. This leads to our second contribution: we\npropose a fair, responsive and partition-resilient Byzantine agreement protocol\ntolerating up to 1/3 corruptions. Fairness means that our protocol achieves\nfair validity. Responsiveness means that the termination time only depends on\nthe actual network delay instead of depending on any pre-determined time bound.\nPartition-resilience means that the safety still holds even if the network is\npartitioned, and the termination will hold if the partition is resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 07:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

The philosophical part of the problem is to explain why a closed\nsystem has definite experimental outcomes. The physical part is to show\nmathematically that there exists a limit in which the contradiction between\nunitary Schroedinger dynamics and a reduction process leading to distinct\noutcomes becomes negligible according to an explicitly stated criterion, and to\nmake this criterion as objective as possible. The physical problem is solved\nhere by redefining the notion of a quantum state and finding a suitable measure\nfor the change of state upon reduction. The appropriate definition of the\nquantum state is not as a ray or density operator in Hilbert space, but rather\nas an equivalence class consisting of all density operators in a given\nsubspace, the members of which all describe the same experimental outcome. For\nsystems containing only subsystems that are integrated with their environments,\nthese equivalence classes can be represented mathematically by projection\noperators, and the resulting formalism is closely related to that used by von\nNeumann to study the increase of entropy predicted by the second law of\nthermodynamics. However, nearly isolated subsystems are reduced only\nindirectly, as a consequence of their interaction with integrated subsystems.\nThe reduced states of isolated subsystems are the same conditional states used\nin the definition of quantum discord. The key concepts of decoherence theory\ncan all be adapted to fit this definition of a quantum state, resulting in a\nunified theory capable of resolving, in principle, all aspects of the quantum\nmeasurement problem.

By utilizing\nthis framework, this paper studies (i) consumers usage preferences across\nvarious appliances, as well as their voluntary contribution of flexibility and\nwillingness to sacrifice comfort for improving grid stability, (ii) impact of\nindividual appliances on the collective goal of reducing demand peaks, and\n(iii) the effect of variable levels of flexibility, cooperation, and\nparticipation on the outcome of coordinated appliance scheduling. Experimental\nevaluation using a novel dataset collected via a smartphone app shows that\nhigher consumer flexibility can significantly reduce demand peaks, with the\noven having the highest system-wide potential for this. Overall, the\ncooperative approach allows for higher peak-shaving compared to non-cooperative\nschemes that focus entirely on the efficiency of individual appliances. The\nfindings of this study can be used to design more cost-effective and granular\n(appliance-level) demand response programs in participatory and decentralized\nSmart Grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 09:14:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 08:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 08:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

While many approaches have been developed in classical graph\ntheory to cluster vertices and segment large graphs in a signal independent\nway, signal localization based approaches to the analysis of data on graph\nrepresent a new research direction which is also a key to big data analytics on\ngraphs. To this end, after an overview of the basic definitions in graphs and\ngraph signals, we present and discuss a localized form of the graph Fourier\ntransform. To establish an analogy with classical signal processing, spectral-\nand vertex-domain definitions of the localization window are given next. The\nspectral and vertex localization kernels are then related to the wavelet\ntransform, followed by a study of filtering and inversion of the localized\ngraph Fourier transform. For rigour, the analysis of energy representation and\nframes in the localized graph Fourier transform is extended to the energy forms\nof vertex-frequency distributions, which operate even without the need to apply\nlocalization windows. Another link with classical signal processing is\nestablished through the concept of local smoothness, which is subsequently\nrelated to the particular paradigm of signal smoothness on graphs. This all\nrepresents a comprehensive account of the relation of general vertex-frequency\nanalysis with classical time-frequency analysis, and important but missing link\nfor more advanced applications of graphs signal processing. The theory is\nsupported by illustrative and practically relevant examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 09:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 08:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

What was the spatial distribution of such galaxies, and\nwhat was the relation to the putative large-scale ionization bubbles during the\nEoR? What were the dark-halo masses of such earliest-epoch star-forming\ngalaxies? To address all these questions, we need to uncover a statistically\nlarge number of $z=10-15$ galaxies in the pre-reionization era. Here we argue\ntwo possible pathways: (1) a wide-area, sensitive blind spectroscopic survey of\n[OIII] 88 $\\mu$m line-emitting galaxies at submillimeter wavelengths, and (2)\nan ultra-wide-area, high-cadence photometric survey of transient sources at\nradio-to-(sub)millimeter wavelengths, together with the immediate follow-up\nspectroscopy with an ultra-wide-band spectrograph, to catch the pop-III\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 10:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

We consider single and bilayer graphene on 1--3 quintuple layers of\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ and extract orbital and proximity induced spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) parameters. We find that graphene gets significantly hole doped (350\nmeV), but the linear dispersion is preserved.

The\ninduced SOC depends weakly on the number of quintuple layers of Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\nWe also study the effect of a transverse electric field, that is applied across\nheterostructures of single and bilayer graphene above 1 quintuple layer of\nBi$_2$Se$_3$.

The destruction of embedded clouds adds mass\ninto the remnant, increasing its density and pressure, and decreasing its\ntemperature. The remnant cools more quickly, is less able to do PdV work on the\nswept-up gas, and ultimately attains a lower final momentum (by up to a factor\nof two or more).

The behaviour of the remnant is more complex in situations where the\ncloud mass is finite and locally runs out.

Computing the secure multicast rate,\nor even the secure unicast rate, in the more general setting in which all\nnetwork nodes may generate (independent) random keys is known to be as\ndifficult as computing the (non-secure) capacity of multiple-unicast network\ncoding instances --- a well known open problem.

We investigate the morphology, stability and dynamical\nproperties of the hub-filament system on basis of 13CO and C18O observations\nobtained with the IRAM-30m telescope and H2 column density maps derived from\nHerschel dust emission observations. We identified the filamentary network and\ncharacterized the individual filaments as either main (converging into the hub)\nor secondary (converging to a main filament) filaments. The main filaments have\nline masses of 30-100 Msun/pc and show signs of fragmentation. The secondary\nfilaments have line masses of 12-60 Msun/pc and show fragmentation only\nsporadically. In the context of Ostriker's hydrostatic filament model, the main\nfilaments are thermally super-critical. If non-thermal motions are included,\nmost of them are trans-critical. Most of the secondary filaments are roughly\ntrans-critical regardless of whether non-thermal motions are included or not.\nFrom the main filaments, we estimate a mass accretion rate of 10(-4)-10(-3)\nMsun/pc into the hub. The secondary filaments accrete into the main filaments\nwith a rate of 0.1-0.4x10(-4) Msun/pc. The main filaments extend into the hub.\nTheir velocity gradients increase towards the hub, suggesting acceleration of\nthe gas. We estimate that with the observed infall velocity, the mass-doubling\ntime of the hub is ~2.5 Myr, ten times larger than the free-fall time,\nsuggesting a dynamically old region. These timescales are comparable with the\nchemical age of the HII region. Inside the hub, the main filaments show a ring-\nor a spiral-like morphology that exhibits rotation and infall motions. One\npossible explanation for the morphology is that gas is falling into the central\ncluster following a spiral-like pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 11:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Experiments on three-modality brain tumor segmentation\nindicate that UAGAN outperforms the existing methods in most cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 12:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

In this chapter, recent\nresults from 2D-IR spectroscopy of native and artificial DNA and RNA are\npresented, together with theoretical calculations of molecular couplings and\nmolecular dynamics simulations. Backbone vibrations of DNA and RNA are\nestablished as sensitive noninvasive probes of the complex behavior of hydrated\nhelices. The results reveal the femtosecond fluctuation dynamics of the water\nshell, the short-range character of Coulomb interactions, and the strength and\nfluctuation amplitudes of interfacial electric fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 12:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

G-IOTA, a very recent\nimprovement of IOTA, targets to protect tips left behind offering hence a good\nconfidence level.

In optical communications, the so-called Kramers-Kronig (KK)\nscheme has been demonstrated to greatly simplify the receiver, reducing the\nhardware to a single photodiode.

Furthermore, the state-of-the art anomaly\ndetection methods are based on coarse-grained statistical models, which are not\nsuccessful to detect anomalies in a large-scale real world systems.

Thus, using\nconventional data-driven approaches to build a reliable discriminative model,\nand further applying this identified surrogate to uncertainty analysis remains\nto be very challenging. A deep learning approach is presented to provide\npredictions based on limited and noisy data. To address noise perturbation, the\nBayesian learning method that naturally facilitates an automatic updating\nmechanism is considered to quantify and propagate model uncertainties into\npredictive quantities. Specifically, hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is\nfirst adopted to describe model uncertainties, which allows the prior\nassumption to be less subjective, while also makes the proposed surrogate more\nrobust. Next, the Bayesian inference is seamlessly integrated into the DL\nframework, which in turn supports probabilistic programming by yielding a\nprobability distribution of the quantities of interest rather than their point\nestimates. Variational inference (VI) is implemented for the posterior\ndistribution analysis where the intractable marginalization of the likelihood\nfunction over parameter space is framed in an optimization format, and\nstochastic gradient descent method is applied to solve this optimization\nproblem.

Prior memory safety checkers such as SoftBound enforce memory\nspatial safety by checking if every access to array elements are within the\ncorresponding array bounds. However, it often results in high execution time\noverhead due to the cost of executing the instructions associated with bounds\nchecking. To mitigate this problem, redundant bounds check elimination\ntechniques are needed. In this paper, we propose CHOP, a Convex Hull\nOPtimization based framework, for bypassing redundant memory bounds checking\nvia profile-guided inferences. In contrast to existing check elimination\ntechniques that are limited by static code analysis, our solution leverages a\nmodel-based inference to identify redundant bounds checking based on runtime\ndata from past program executions. For a given function, it rapidly derives and\nupdates a knowledge base containing sufficient conditions for identifying\nredundant array bounds checking. We evaluate CHOP on real-world applications\nand benchmark (such as SPEC) and the experimental results show that on average\n80.12% of dynamic bounds check instructions can be avoided, resulting in\nimproved performance up to 95.80% over SoftBound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 15:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

With laser\nintensities under the ablation threshold (a few 10 TW/cm\\textsuperscript{2}),\nelectrons with unexpected energies in excess of 40-50 eV are observed by using\nthe photoemission spectroscopy. A theoretical approach based on the Boltzmann\nkinetic equation including state-of-the-art modeling for various particles\ninteractions is developed to interpret these experimental observations. A\ndirect comparison shows that both electron heating in the bulk and a further\nlaser field acceleration after ejection from the material contribute\nequivalently to the final electron energy gain. The electron heating in the\nbulk is shown to be significantly driven by a non-collisional process, i.e.\ndirect multiphoton transitions between sub-bands of the conduction band. This\nwork also sheds light on the contribution of the standard electron\nexcitation/relaxation collisional processes, providing a new baseline to study\nthe electron dynamics in dielectric materials and associated applications as\nlaser material structuring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 15:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}
