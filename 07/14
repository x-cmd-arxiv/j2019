We present a\nsystematic exploration of the flow in this regime. When there are no upstream\ngradients, the flow is always stable regardless of accretor size or Mach\nnumber. For finite upstream gradients, there are three main types of behavior:\nstable flow (small upstream gradient), turbulent unstable flow without a disk\n(intermediate upstream gradient), and turbulent flow with a disk-like structure\n(relatively large upstream gradient). When the accretion flow is turbulent, the\naccretion rate decreases non-convergently as the accretor size decreases. The\nflow is more prone to instability and the disk is less likely to form than\npreviously expected; the parameters of most observed SgXBs place them in the\nregime of a turbulent, disk-less accretion flow.

Starting from some\nof the traditional image segmentation approaches, the paper progresses\ndescribing the effect deep learning had on the image segmentation domain.\nThereafter, most of the major segmentation algorithms have been logically\ncategorized with paragraphs dedicated to their unique contribution. With an\nample amount of intuitive explanations, the reader is expected to have an\nimproved ability to visualize the internal dynamics of these processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 19:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Our\napproach builds on a criterion for determining the BKT transition temperature\nfor atomic gases which is based on a well established Quantum Monte Carlo\nanalysis of the phase space density. This latter quantity, when derived from\nBCS-BEC crossover theory for fermions, leads to non-monotonic behavior for\n$T_{\\text{BKT}}$ as a function of the attractive interaction or inverse\nscattering length. In Fermi gases, this implies a robust superconducting dome\nfollowed by a long tail from the flat BEC asymptote, rather similar to what is\nobserved experimentally. For lattice systems we find that $T_{\\text{BKT}}$ has\nan absolute maximum of the order of $0.1 E_F$.

Comparing with other data structures, such as\nsequences and trees, graphs are generally more powerful in representing complex\ncorrelations among entities. For example, a knowledge graph stores real-word\nentities (such as \"Barack_Obama\" and \"U.S.\") and their relations (such as\n\"live_in\" and \"lead_by\"). Properly encoding a knowledge graph is beneficial to\nuser applications, such as question answering and knowledge discovery. Modeling\ngraphs is also very challenging, probably because graphs usually contain\nmassive and cyclic relations.\n  Recent years have witnessed the success of deep learning, especially\nRNN-based models, on many NLP problems. Besides, RNNs and their variations have\nbeen extensively studied on several graph problems and showed preliminary\nsuccesses. Despite the successes that have been achieved, RNN-based models\nsuffer from several major drawbacks on graphs. First, they can only consume\nsequential data, thus linearization is required to serialize input graphs,\nresulting in the loss of important structural information. Second, the\nserialization results are usually very long, so it takes a long time for RNNs\nto encode them.\n  In this thesis, we propose a novel graph neural network, named graph\nrecurrent network (GRN). We study our GRN model on 4 very different tasks, such\nas machine reading comprehension, relation extraction and machine translation.\nSome take undirected graphs without edge labels, while the others have directed\nones with edge labels. To consider these important differences, we gradually\nenhance our GRN model, such as further considering edge labels and adding an\nRNN decoder. Carefully designed experiments show the effectiveness of GRN on\nall these tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 22:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Recently, there has been a\nsurge of interest in exploring efficient graph-based indices for the ANNS\nproblem.

In addition,\nNSG suffers from high indexing complexity. To address the above problems, we\npropose the Satellite System Graphs (SSG) and a practical variant NSSG.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel pruning strategy to produce SSGs from the\ncomplete graph.

However, most car-following\nmodels are deterministic and do not capture the stochastic nature of human\nperception. It is expected that purely deterministic traffic models may produce\nunrealistic results due to the stochastic driving behaviors of drivers. This\npaper is devoted to the development of a distinct car-following model where a\nstochastic process is adopted to describe the time-varying random acceleration\nwhich essentially reflects the random individual perception of driver behavior\nwith respect to the leading vehicle over time. In particular, we apply coupled\nLangevin equations to model complex human driver behavior. In the proposed\nmodel, an extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic process will be used to\ndescribe the stochastic speed of the follower in response to the stimulus of\nthe leader. An important property of the extended CIR process is to enhance the\nnon-negative properties of the stochastic traffic variables (e.g. non-negative\nspeed) for any arbitrary model parameters. Based on stochastic process\ntheories, we derive stochastic linear stability conditions which, for the first\ntime, theoretically capture the effect of the random parameter on traffic\ninstabilities. Our stability results conform to the empirical results that the\ntraffic instability is related to the stochastic nature of traffic flow at the\nlow speed conditions, even when traffic is deemed to be stable from\ndeterministic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 23:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Documenting feature toggle's metadata, setting up the\ndefault value for feature toggles, and logging the changes made on feature\ntoggles are also frequently-observed practices. Conclusions: The feature toggle\ndevelopment practices discovered and enumerated in this work can help\npractitioners more effectively use feature toggles. This work can enable future\nmining of code repositories to automatically identify feature toggle practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 02:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

However, existing\ntheoretical models do not fully consider the fundamental aspects of thermionic\nemission when the inter-electrode gap shrinks to the nanoscale, which results\nin underestimation of thermionic power generation for such small gaps. The\npresent work addresses this challenge by comprehensively modeling charge and\nthermal transport processes with specific consideration of nanoscale gap\neffects, such as image charge perturbation, electron tunneling, and near-field\nthermal radiation. Carefully conducted energy balance analysis reveals that if\noptimized, submicron-gap TEC can excel the micron-gap counterpart with $\\sim$4\ntimes the power output and ~5-10 % higher energy conversion efficiency.\nMoreover, the high-temperature collector of the submicron-gap TEC, which is due\nto thermionic and near-field radiative heat transfer, allows the addition of a\nbottom-cycle heat engine to further enhance the power and efficiency when\ncombined. Electric field concentration due to engineered surface roughness is\nalso examined as a potential approach to produce an additional increase in\npower generation.

Circumventing explicit eigenvalue computation, we maximize\ninstead the lower bound of $\\lambda_{\\min}$, designated by the smallest\nleft-end of all Gershgorin discs of the matrix. To achieve this efficiently, we\nfirst convert the optimization to a dual problem, where we minimize the number\nof samples needed to align all Gershgorin disc left-ends at a chosen\nlower-bound target $T$.

To characterize the\noccasional building blockage between the UAV and SNs, we construct the\nprobabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model for a Manhattan-type city by\nusing the combined simulation and data regression method, which is shown in the\nform of a generalized logistic function of the UAV-SN elevation angle. We\nassume that only the knowledge of SNs' locations and the probabilistic LoS\nchannel model is known a priori, while the UAV can obtain the instantaneous\nLoS/Non-LoS channel state information (CSI) with the SNs in real time along its\nflight. Our objective is to maximize the minimum (average) data collection rate\nfrom all the SNs for the UAV. To this end, we formulate a new rate maximization\nproblem by jointly optimizing the UAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory and\ntransmission scheduling of SNs. Although the optimal solution is intractable\ndue to the lack of the complete UAV-SNs CSI, we propose in this paper a novel\nand general design method, called hybrid offline-online optimization, to obtain\na suboptimal solution to it, by leveraging both the statistical and real-time\nCSI. Essentially, our proposed method decouples the joint design of UAV\ntrajectory and communication scheduling into two phases: namely, an offline\nphase that determines the UAV path prior to its flight based on the\nprobabilistic LoS channel model, followed by an online phase that adaptively\nadjusts the UAV flying speeds along the offline optimized path as well as\ncommunication scheduling based on the instantaneous UAV-SNs CSI and SNs'\nindividual amounts of data received accumulatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 07:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 12:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

However, they have long been criticized\nfor being a black-box, in that interpretation, understanding and correcting\narchitectures is difficult as there is no general theory for deep neural\nnetwork design. Previously, precision learning was proposed to fuse deep\narchitectures and traditional approaches. Deep networks constructed in this way\nbenefit from the original known operator, have fewer parameters, and improved\ninterpretability. However, they do not yield state-of-the-art performance in\nall applications. In this paper, we propose to analyze deep networks using\nknown operators, by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to replace network\ncomponents, whilst retaining its performance. The task of retinal vessel\nsegmentation is investigated for this purpose. We start with a high-performance\nU-Net and show by step-by-step conversion that we are able to divide the\nnetwork into modules of known operators. The results indicate that a\ncombination of a trainable guided filter and a trainable version of the Frangi\nfilter yields a performance at the level of U-Net (AUC 0.974 vs. 0.972) with a\ntremendous reduction in parameters (111,536 vs. 9,575).

In contrast to centralized privacy scenarios\nwith a trusted curator, in the local setup anonymization must be guaranteed\nalready on the individual data owners' side and therefore must precede any data\nmining tasks. Thus, the published anonymized data should be compatible with as\nmany statistical procedures as possible. We suggest adding Laplace noise and\nGaussian processes (both appropriately scaled) to kernel density estimators to\nobtain approximate differential private versions of the latter ones. We obtain\nminimax type results over Sobolev classes indexed by a smoothness parameter\n$s>1/2$ for the mean squared error at a fixed point. In particular, we show\nthat taking the average of private kernel density estimators from $n$ different\ndata owners attains the optimal rate of convergence if the bandwidth parameter\nis correctly specified. Notably, the optimal convergence rate in terms of the\nsample size $n$ is $n^{-(2s-1)/(2s+1)}$ under local differential privacy and\nthus deteriorated to the rate $n^{-(2s-1)/(2s)}$ which holds without privacy\nrestrictions. Since the optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter depends on\nthe smoothness $s$ and is thus not accessible in practice, adaptive methods for\nbandwidth selection are necessary and must, in the local privacy framework, be\nperformed directly on the anonymized data. We address this problem by means of\na variant of Lepski's method tailored to the privacy setup and obtain general\noracle inequalities for private kernel density estimators. In the Sobolev case,\nthe resulting adaptive estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence at\nleast up to extra logarithmic factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 15:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

In QAOA, the objective is a\nfunction of the quantum state, which itself is a function of the gate\nparameters of a multi-level parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). A classical\noptimizer varies the continuous gate parameters to generate distributions\n(quantum state) with significant support to the optimal solution. Even at the\nlowest circuit depth, QAOA offers non-trivial provable performance guarantee\nwhich is expected to increase with the circuit depth. However, the existing\nanalysis fails to consider non-idealities in the qubit quality i.e., short\nlifetime and imperfect gate operations in realistic quantum hardware. In this\narticle, we investigate the impact of various noise sources on the performance\nof QAOA both in simulation and on a real quantum computer from IBM. Our\nanalyses indicate that the optimal number of stages (p-value) for any QAOA\ninstance is limited by the noise characteristics (gate error, coherence time,\netc.) of the target hardware as opposed to the current perception that\nhigher-depth QAOA will provide monotonically better performance for a given\nproblem compared to the low-depth implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 22:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In the process of our attempt to understand the mechanisms behind\nthe success of the occasional uncoupling schemes, we devise a hybrid between\nthe transient uncoupling and the stochastic on-off coupling, and aptly name it\nthe transient stochastic uncoupling---yet another stochastic occasional\nuncoupling method. Our subsequent investigation on the transient stochastic\nuncoupling allows us to surpass the effectiveness of the stochastic on-off\ncoupling with very fast on-off switching rate. Additionally, through the\ntransient stochastic uncoupling, we establish that the indicators quantifying\nthe local contracting dynamics in the corresponding transverse manifold are\ngenerally not useful in finding the optimal coupling region of the phase space\nin the case of the deterministic transient uncoupling. In fact, we highlight\nthat the autocorrelation function---a non-local indicator of the dynamics---of\nthe corresponding response system's chaotic time-series dictates when the\ndeterministic uncoupling could be successful. We illustrate all our heuristic\nresults using a few well-known examples of diffusively coupled chaotic\noscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 14:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 11:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}
