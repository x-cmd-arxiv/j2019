These seemingly disparate topics of\nstudy in mathematics, model theory and operator algebras, have in recent years\nbecome closely related in many respects. I here attempt to bridge the gap\nbetween these two topics by discussing how operator algebraic classifications\nmay be understood in terms of model-theoretic classification theory. This\nintroductory article assumes basic familiarity with model theory and linear\noperator, but higher-level concepts are introduced when necessary. The focus of\nthis introduction is conceptual and informal, and as such, many results are\nstated without proof, but relevant sources are cited for completeness. The\nreader should take this not as a detailed review, but rather as an overview of\na general narrative thread connecting these two branches of modern mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 16:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

Normalized random matrix products of this form arise naturally in\nstochastic iterative algorithms, such as Oja's algorithm for streaming\nPrincipal Component Analysis.

Here, we present\nthe first observation of optical photon pairs in the Laughlin state. These\npairs emerge from a photonic analog of a fractional quantum Hall system, which\ncombines strong, Rydberg-mediated interactions between photons and synthetic\nmagnetic fields for light, induced by twisting an optical resonator. Photons\nentering this system undergo collisions to form pairs in an angular momentum\nsuperposition consistent with the Laughlin state. Characterizing the same pairs\nin real space reveals that the photons avoid each other, a hallmark of the\nLaughlin state. This work heralds a new era of quantum many-body optics, where\nstrongly interacting and topological photons enable exploration of quantum\nmatter with wholly new properties and unique probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 17:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In this paper we develop a\nnon-Markovian extension of the standard Caldeira-Leggett model, based on\nexpanding the dynamics of the reduced system at high temperature in inverse\npowers of the high-frequency cut-off of the Ohmic spectral density of the\nenvironment, and derive a non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density\nmatrix for the case of a general potential. We also obtain a fully analytical\nsolution in the free particle case.

Stellar age has a strong affect on the shape of the\nfallback curve, and can produce characteristic timescales (e.g., the time to\nthe peak of the fallback rate) that greatly differ from the polytropic values.\nWe use these differences to assess the degree to which the inferred black hole\nmass from the observed lightcurve can deviate from the true value, and find\nthat the discrepancy can be at the order of magnitude level. Accurate stellar\nstructure also leads to a substantial variation in the critical impact\nparameter at which the star is fully disrupted, and can increase the\nsusceptibility of the debris stream to fragmentation under its own\nself-gravity.

Because the final state hadronization effects are significantly reduced,\nthe SIDIS case allows to probe the TMD parton distribution functions. We\ndiscuss the sources of non-perturbative effects in the low transverse momentum\nregion including novel (but small) effects that arise due to grooming. We\nderive a factorization theorem within SCET and resum any large logarithm in the\nmeasured transverse momentum up to NNLL accuracy using the $\\zeta$-prescription\nas implemented in the artemide package and provide a comparison with\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 11:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 09:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Our technique is computationally\ntractable, generally outperforms other methods, is extensible to other\nphenotypes, and also identifies different genes (relative to existing methods)\nfor possible future study.\n  Key words: regression; principal components; matrix sketching;\npreconditioning\n  Availability: All of the code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/dajmcdon/aimer/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 19:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Such exotic decays of the $t'$ can be\ncompetitive with decays into SM particles, leading to new possible discovery\nchannels at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Assuming $t'$ pair production via\nstrong interactions, we design signal regions optimised for one $t'\\rightarrow\nS t$ transition (while being inclusive on the other \\bar{t'} decay, and vice\nversa), followed by the decay of $S$ into the two very clean experimental\nsignatures $S\\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$ and $S\\rightarrow Z(\\rightarrow\n\\ell^+\\ell^-)\\gamma$.

The goal of the agent is to find her way home, which is located\nin a grid cell chosen by an adversary. Initially, the agent is provided with an\ninfinite sequence of instructions, that dictate the movements performed by the\nagent. Each instruction corresponds to a movement to an adjacent grid cell and\nthe set of instructions can be a function of the initial locations of the agent\nand home. The challenge of our problem stems from faults in the movements made\nby the agent. In every step, with some constant probability $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$,\nthe agent performs a random movement instead of following the current\ninstruction.\n  This paper provides two results on this problem. First, we show that for some\nvalues of $p$, there does not exist any set of instructions that guide the\nagent home in finite expected time. Second, we complement this impossibility\nresult with an algorithm that, for sufficiently small values of $p$, yields a\nfinite expected hitting time for home. In particular, we show that for any $p <\n1$, our approach gives a hitting rate that decays polynomially as a function of\ntime. In that sense, our approach is far superior to a standard random walk in\nterms of hitting time. The main contribution and take-home message of this\npaper is to show that, for some value of $0.01139\\dots < p < 0.6554\\ldots$,\nthere exists a phase transition on the solvability of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 20:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

This scenario was experimentally realized by irradiating a\nRubidium atom by two low-intensity continuous-wave lasers [Pursehouse et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 122, 053204 (2019)]. In a one-photon process the first laser\nexcites the 5p level while the second uncorrelated photon elevates the excited\npopulation to the continuum.

Indoor wireless optical backhauling is a novel\napproach whereby the interconnections between adjacent LiFi BSs are provided by\nway of directed line-of-sight (LOS) wireless infrared (IR) links. Building on\nthe aforesaid approach, this paper presents the top-down design of a multi-hop\nwireless backhaul configuration for multi-tier optical attocell networks by\nproposing the novel idea of super cells. Such cells incorporate multiple\nclusters of attocells that are connected to the core network via a single\ngateway based on multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. Consequently, new\nchallenges arise for managing the bandwidth and power resources of the\nbottleneck backhaul. By putting forward user-based bandwidth scheduling (UBS)\nand cell-based bandwidth scheduling (CBS) policies, the system-level modeling\nand analysis of the end-to-end multi-user sum rate is elaborated. In addition,\noptimal bandwidth scheduling under both UBS and CBS policies are formulated as\nconstrained convex optimization problems, which are solved by using the\nprojected subgradient method. Furthermore, the transmission power of the\nbackhaul system is opportunistically reduced by way of an innovative fixed\npower control (FPC) strategy. The notion of backhaul bottleneck occurrence\n(BBO) is introduced. An accurate approximate expression of the probability of\nBBO is derived, and then verified using Monte Carlo simulations. Several\ninsights are provided into the offered gains of the proposed schemes through\nextensive computer simulations, by studying different aspects of the\nperformance of super cells including the average sum rate, the BBO probability\nand the backhaul power efficiency (PE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

This is particularly welcome, as a growing number of experiments\nsuggest the crossover to be a common feature shared by many systems: in some\ncases the anomalous part of the dynamics amounts to a Brownian yet non-Gaussian\ndiffusion; more generally, both the diffusion exponent and the distribution may\ndeviate from normal behavior in the initial part of the process. Since proposed\ntheories work at a mesoscopic scale invoking the subordination of\ndiffusivities, it is of primary importance to bridge these representations with\na more fundamental, ``microscopic'' description. We argue that the dynamical\nbehavior of macromolecules during simple polymerization processes provide\nsuitable setups in which analytic, numerical, and particle-tracking experiments\ncan be contrasted at such a scope. Specifically, we demonstrate that Brownian\nyet non-Gaussian diffusion of the center of mass of a polymer is a direct\nconsequence of the polymerization process.

A Finsler manifold is\ncalled g.o.~if each constant speed geodesic is the orbit of a one-parameter\nsubgroup. Besides the non-negatively curved condition, we also concern the (FP)\ncondition for the flag curvature, i.e., in any flag we can find a flag pole,\nsuch that the flag curvature is positive. The main theorem we will prove is the\nfollowing. If a g.o.~Finsler space $(M,F)$ has non-negative flag curvature and\nsatisfies the (FP) condition, then $M$ must be compact.

Very recently, Bar-On et al. introduced at Eurocrypt'19 a new\ntool, called the Differential-Linear Connectivity Table (DLCT).This paper is a\nfollow-up work, which presents further theoretical characterization of the DLCT\nof vectorial Boolean functions and also investigates this new criterion of\nfunctions with certain forms. In this paper we introduce a generalized concept\nof the additive autocorrelation, which is extended from Boolean functions to\nthe vectorial Boolean functions, and use it as a main tool to investigate the\nDLCT property of vectorial Boolean functions. Firstly, by establishing a\nconnection between the DLCT and the additive autocorrelation, we characterize\nproperties of DLCT by means of the Walsh transform and the differential\ndistribution table, and present generic lower bounds on the differential-linear\nuniformity (DLU) of vectorial Boolean functions. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe DLCT property of monomials, APN, plateaued and AB functions. Our study\nreveals that the DLCT of these special functions are closely related to other\ncryptographic criteria. Next, we prove that the DLU of vectorial Boolean\nfunctions is invariant underthe EA equivalence but not invariant under the CCZ\nequivalence, and that the DLCT spectrum is only invariant under affine\nequivalence. In addition, under affine equivalence, we exhaust the DLCT spectra\nand DLU of optimal S-boxes with $4$ bit by Magma. Finally, we investigate the\nDLCT spectra and DLU of some polynomials over $F_{2^n}$, including the inverse,\nGold, Bracken-Leander power functions and all quadratic polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 00:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

We consider a variant of the problem and explore its connections to\ndata-driven online selection. Specifically, we are given $n$ cards with\narbitrary non-negative numbers written on both sides. The cards are randomly\nplaced on $n$ consecutive positions on a table, and for each card, the visible\nside is also selected at random. The player sees the visible side of all cards\nand wants to select the card with the maximum hidden value. To this end, the\nplayer flips the first card, sees its hidden value and decides whether to pick\nit or drop it and continue with the next card.\n  We study algorithms for two natural objectives. In the first one, as in the\nsecretary problem, the player wants to maximize the probability of selecting\nthe maximum hidden value. We show that this can be done with probability at\nleast $0.45292$. In the second one, similar to the prophet inequality, the\nplayer maximizes the expectation of the selected hidden value. We show a\nguarantee of at least $0.63518$ with respect to the expected maximum hidden\nvalue.\n  Our algorithms result from combining three basic strategies. One is to stop\nwhenever we see a value larger than the initial $n$ visible numbers.

For spatiotemporal systems, this problem\nis further exacerbated by their intricate dynamics. Modern machine learning\nmethods are particularly well-suited for analyzing and modeling complex\ndatasets, but to be effective in science, the result needs to be interpretable.\nWe demonstrate an unsupervised learning technique for extracting interpretable\nphysical parameters from noisy spatiotemporal data and for building a\ntransferable model of the system. In particular, we implement a\nphysics-informed architecture based on variational autoencoders that is\ndesigned for analyzing systems governed by partial differential equations\n(PDEs). The architecture is trained end-to-end and extracts latent parameters\nthat parameterize the dynamics of a learned predictive model for the system. To\ntest our method, we train our model on simulated data from a variety of PDEs\nwith varying dynamical parameters that act as uncontrolled variables. Numerical\nexperiments show that our method can accurately identify relevant parameters\nand extract them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal data (tested with\nroughly 10% added noise). These extracted parameters correlate well (linearly\nwith $R^2 > 0.95$) with the ground truth physical parameters used to generate\nthe datasets. We then apply this method to nonlinear fiber propagation data,\ngenerated by an ab-initio simulation, to demonstrate its capabilities on a more\nrealistic dataset.

Recently developed\napproaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) significantly improve\nthe performance of depth estimation.

These generative grasp models are\nlearned from demonstration (LfD). One weakness is that, as this paper shall\nshow, grasp transfer under challenging single view conditions is unreliable.\nSecond, the number of generative model elements rises linearly in the number of\ntraining examples. This, in turn, limits the potential of these generative\nmodels for generalisation and continual improvement. In this paper, it is shown\nhow to address these problems. Several technical contributions are made: (i) a\nview-based model of a grasp; (ii) a method for combining and compressing\nmultiple grasp models; (iii) a new way of evaluating contacts that is used both\nto generate and to score grasps. These, together, improve both grasp\nperformance and reduce the number of models learned for grasp transfer. These\nadvances, in turn, also allow the introduction of autonomous training, in which\nthe robot learns from self-generated grasps. Evaluation on a challenging test\nset shows that, with innovations (i)-(iii) deployed, grasp transfer success\nrises from 55.1% to 81.6%. By adding autonomous training this rises to 87.8%.\nThese differences are statistically significant. In total, across all\nexperiments, 539 test grasps were executed on real objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 11:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

We characterize the diffuse TeV flux from the Galaxy\nusing decade-long exposures of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Considering that\nthe level of diffuse Galactic emission in the TeV band approaches the level of\nresidual cosmic-ray background, we estimated the level of residual cosmic-ray\nbackground in the SOURCEVETO event selection and verified that the TeV diffuse\nGalactic emission flux is well above the residual cosmic-ray background up to\nhigh Galactic latitude regions.

We also find a significant difference in the measurement of the\nGalactic longitude and latitude profiles of the signal measured by Fermi and\nHESS. These discrepancies are presumably explained by the fact that regions of\nbackground estimate in HESS have non-negligible gamma-ray flux.

Physically, a word pulse\ntriggers SFT to a resistive state, causing the PS switching between the logical\n\"0\" and \"1\" states. Thus, the whole switching dynamics of MC depends on the\nnon-equilibrium and nonstationary properties of PS and SFT. Modeling the single\nMC as well as the larger MC-based circuits comprising respectively twelve and\nthirty elements suggest that such the memory cells can undergo ultrafast\nswitching (sub-ns) and low energy consumption per operation (sub-100 fJ). The\nsuggested model allows studying the influence of noises, punch-through effect,\ncrosstalk, parasitic, etc. The obtained results suggest that the hybrid PS/SFT\nstructures are well-suited to superconducting computing circuits as they are\nbuilt of magnetic and non-magnetic transition metals and therefore have low\nimpedances (1-30 Ohm).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 13:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

In particular, we use gender identifications and speaker recognition\nas auxiliary tasks, which allow the use of very large datasets, e.g., speaker\nclassification datasets. To maximise the benefit of multi-task learning, we\nfurther use an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) within our framework, which has a\nstrong capability to learn powerful and discriminative features. Furthermore,\nthe unsupervised AAE in combination with the supervised classification networks\nenables semi-supervised learning which incorporates a discriminative component\nin the AAE unsupervised training pipeline. This semi-supervised learning\nessentially helps to improve generalisation of our framework and thus leads to\nimprovements in SER performance.

The model relates the discrete-time\ninput symbol sequences of co-propagating wavelength channels to the received\nsymbol sequence after matched filtering and T-spaced sampling. To this end, the\ninterference from both self- and cross-channel nonlinear interactions of the\ncontinuous-time optical signal is represented by a single discrete-time\nperturbative term. Two equivalent discrete-time models can be formulated---one\nin the time-domain, the other in the 1/T-periodic continuous-frequency domain.\nThe time-domain formulation coincides with the well-known pulse-collision\npicture. The novel frequency-domain picture incorporates the sampling operation\nvia an aliased and periodic kernel description. This gives rise to an\nalternative perspective on the end-to-end input/output relation between the\nspectrum of the discrete-time transmit symbol sequence and the spectrum of the\nreceive symbol sequence. Both views can be extended from a regular, i.e.,\nsolely additive model, to a combined regular-logarithmic model to take the\nmultiplicative nature of certain distortions into consideration.

In this realm, the phases with\ntopological order cannot be characterized by symmetry alone. Moreover, the\nrelevant phase transitions do occur without spontaneous symmetry breaking,\nbeyond the scope of Landau's theory. The first realization of such phases is\nthe discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was followed soon\nby a topological interpretation. Later on, a distinct, half-integer QHE was\nalso found from graphene, which has almost spin degeneracy described by $SU(2)$\nsymmetry. The previous theoretical predictions were realized in this finding.\nIt has been well understood that the anomaly of this half-integer QHE\noriginates from the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions around the zero\nenergy with respect to the original Dirac points (DPs). The very characteristic\nlies in that there exists a topologically robust zero-mode LL that is a\nconstant function of the perpendicular magnetic field. More deeply, this\nzero-mode LL is protected by the local chiral symmetry (CS), against CS\npreserving perturbations provided that intervalley scattering between the\ndouble DPs is inhibited, where the CS arises from the global sublattice\nsymmetry in spinless graphene. Since massless Dirac particles are broadly\npresent in condensed matter with various symmetries, not to mention Dirac\nbosonic systems, it is of interest to see how about the situations in other\nsystems with $2$D massless Dirac fermions.

To reduce integration error of the DUGKS and ensure the\nconservation property of the collision term in isothermal flow simulations, a\nConserved-DUGKS (C-DUGKS) is proposed.

In this paper, we proposed\na novel Deep fault diagnosis (DFD) method for rotating machinery with scarce\nlabeled samples. DFD tackles the challenging problem by transferring knowledge\nfrom shallow models, which is based on the idea that shallow models trained\nwith different hand-crafted features can reveal the latent prior knowledge and\ndiagnostic expertise and have good generalization ability even with scarce\nlabeled samples. DFD can be divided into three phases. First, a spectrogram of\nthe raw vibration signal is calculated by applying a Short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT). From those spectrograms, discriminative time-frequency domain\nfeatures can be extracted and used to form a feature pool. Then, several\ncandidate Support vector machine (SVM) models are trained with different\ncombinations of features in the feature pool with scarce labeled samples. By\nevaluating the pretrained SVM models on the validation set, the most\ndiscriminative features and best-performed SVM models can be selected, which\nare used to make predictions on the unlabeled samples. The predicted labels\nreserve the expert knowledge originally carried by the SVM model. They are\ncombined together with the scarce fine labeled samples to form an Augmented\ntraining set (ATS). Finally, a novel 2D deep Convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodel is trained on the ATS to learn more discriminative features and a better\nclassifier. Experimental results on two fault diagnosis datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed DFD, which achieves better performance than\nSVM models and the vanilla deep CNN model trained on scarce labeled samples.\nMoreover, it is computationally efficient and is promising for real-time\nrotating machinery fault diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 10:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

It provides a comprehensive coverage of\nboth deep and shallow solutions, as they stand today, and highlight areas\nrequiring future development and improvement. This review is aimed at\nfacilitating research into novel approaches, and further development of current\nmethodologies by scientists and engineers, whilst imparting an informative and\nanalytical perspective on currently available solutions to end users in\nindustry, government and consumer contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 22:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

This contrasts with the fact that objects' paths\nare not independent: a cyclist might abruptly deviate from a previously planned\ntrajectory in order to avoid colliding with a car. Building upon HART, a neural\nclass-agnostic single-object tracker, we introduce a multi-object tracking\nmethod MOHART capable of relational reasoning. Importantly, the entire system,\nincluding the understanding of interactions and relations between objects, is\nclass-agnostic and learned simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion. We explore\na number of relational reasoning architectures and show that\npermutation-invariant models outperform non-permutation-invariant alternatives.\nWe also find that architectures using a single permutation invariant operation\nlike DeepSets, despite, in theory, being universal function approximators, are\nnonetheless outperformed by a more complex architecture based on multi-headed\nattention. The latter better accounts for complex physical interactions in a\nchallenging toy experiment. Further, we find that modelling interactions leads\nto consistent performance gains in tracking as well as future trajectory\nprediction on three real-world datasets (MOTChallenge, UA-DETRAC, and Stanford\nDrone dataset), particularly in the presence of ego-motion, occlusions, crowded\nscenes, and faulty sensor inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 22:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 17:17:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 15:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 14:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

This is due to reduced cost, and evolution in hardware\nand algorithms which have improved their ability to handle unconstrained\nconditions. Evidently affordable and efficient applications are required.\nHowever, there is much debate over which methods are most appropriate,\nparticularly in the context of the growing importance of deep neural\nnetwork-based face recognition systems. This systematic review attempts to\nprovide clarity on both issues by organizing the plethora of research and data\nin this field to clarify current research trends, state-of-the-art methods, and\nprovides an outline of their benefits and shortcomings. Overall, this research\ncovered 1,330 relevant studies, showing an increase of over 200% in research\ninterest in the field of face recognition over the past 6 years. Our results\nalso demonstrated that deep learning methods are the prime focus of modern\nresearch due to improvements in hardware databases and increasing understanding\nof neural networks. In contrast, traditional methods have lost favor amongst\nresearchers due to their inherent limitations in accuracy, and lack of\nefficiency when handling large amounts of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 23:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

For the natural situation of illumination\nby incoherent (sun)light, the relevance of these vibrations is analyzed here\nfor light-harvesting vibronic prototype dimers. The detailed analysis of the\ndensity matrix dynamics reveals that the inclusion of the intramolecular\nvibrational modes reinforce up to one order of magnitude the exciton coherence\nand may increase the populations of lowest energy single exciton states, as\nwell as populations and coherences in the site basis. In sharp contrast to the\ncase of initial-state preparation by coherent (laser)light-sources, the initial\nthermal state of the local vibrational modes, as well as that of the\nanti-correlated mode, evolves devoid of non-classical correlations as confirmed\nby the absence of negative values of its phase-space quasi-probability\ndistribution at all times. Therefore, not only the long-lived coherences\nobserved in two-dimensional spectra are induced by the coherent character of\npulsed laser sources, but it is unambiguously shown here that the non-classical\ncharacter generally assigned to the anti-correlated vibrational mode also comes\nas the result of the preparation of the initial state by coherent pulsed laser\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}
