However, these systems\nare limited in that the user has little means of understanding the rationale\nbehind the systems suggestions, communicating their own understanding of\npatterns, or correcting system behavior. In this project, we outline a model\nfor intelligent software based on a human computer feedback loop. The Machine\nLearning (ML) systems recommendations are reviewed by the user, and in turn,\nthis information shapes the systems decision making. Our model was applied to\ndeveloping an HTML editor that integrates ML with user interaction to ascertain\nstructural relationships between HTML document features and apply them for code\ncompletion. The editor utilizes the ID3 algorithm to build decision trees,\nsequences of rules for predicting code the user will type. The editor displays\nthe decision trees rules in the Interactive Rules Interface System (IRIS),\nwhich allows developers to prioritize, modify, or delete them. These\ninteractions alter the data processed by ID3, providing the developer some\ncontrol over the autocomplete system. Validation indicates that, absent user\ninteraction, the ML model is able to predict tags with 78.4 percent accuracy,\nattributes with 62.9 percent accuracy, and values with 12.8 percent accuracy.\nBased off of the results of the user study, user interaction with the rules\ninterface corrects feature relationships missed or mistaken by the automated\nprocess, enhancing autocomplete accuracy and developer productivity.\nAdditionally, interaction is proven to help developers work with greater\nawareness of code patterns. Our research demonstrates the viability of a\nsoftware integration of machine intelligence with human feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The SoV bases are obtained by using the integrable structure\nof these quantum models,i.e. the associated commuting transfer matrices,\nfollowing the general scheme introduced in [1]; namely, they are given by set\nof states generated by the multiple action of the transfer matrices on a\ngeneric co-vector. The existence of such SoV bases implies that the\ncorresponding transfer matrices have non degenerate spectrum and that they are\ndiagonalizable with simple spectrum if the twist matrices defining the\nquasi-periodic boundary conditions have that property. Moreover, in these SoV\nbases the resolution of the transfer matrix eigenvalue problem leads to the\nresolution of the full spectral problem, i.e. both eigenvalues and\neigenvectors. Indeed, to any eigenvalue is associated the unique (up to a\ntrivial overall normalization) eigenvector whose wave-function in the SoV bases\nis factorized into products of the corresponding transfer matrix eigenvalue\ncomputed on the spectrum of the separate variables.

In 2006, Procaccia and\nRosenschein considered a utilitarian social choice setting, where the agents\nhave explicit numerical values for the alternatives, yet they only report their\nlinear orderings over them. To compare different aggregation mechanisms,\nProcaccia and Rosenschein introduced the notion of distortion, which quantifies\nthe inefficiency of using only ordinal information when trying to maximize the\nsocial welfare, i.e., the sum of the underlying values of the agents for the\nchosen outcome. Since then, this research area has flourished and bounds on the\ndistortion have been obtained for a wide variety of fundamental scenarios.\nHowever, the vast majority of the existing literature is focused on the case\nwhere nothing is known beyond the ordinal preferences of the agents over the\nalternatives. In this paper, we take a more expressive approach, and consider\nmechanisms that are allowed to further ask a few cardinal queries in order to\ngain partial access to the underlying values that the agents have for the\nalternatives. With this extra power, we design new deterministic mechanisms\nthat achieve significantly improved distortion bounds and, in many cases,\noutperform the best-known randomized ordinal mechanisms. We paint an almost\ncomplete picture of the number of queries required by deterministic mechanisms\nto achieve specific distortion bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 10:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

The most\nvoluminous sedimentary rocks that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are\nsulfate-rich rocks, explored by the $Opportunity$ rover from 2004-2012 and soon\nto be investigated by the $Curiosity$ rover at Gale crater. A leading\nhypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived\nfrom evaporation of deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation\nof groundwater. Global groundwater circulation would imply sustained warm\nEarthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation of groundwater including\ninfiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO$_2$ atmosphere\nimplies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO$_2$\nsequestration implied by the global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of\nsulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the $Opportunity$ data are\nrepresentative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that (even\naccounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This\ndisfavors the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were\nderived from upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. If, instead, Hesperian\nsulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the CO$_2$\nsequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the\nhypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from\nupwelling of deep sourced groundwater. In both cases, carbon sequestration by\nglobal groundwater circulation actively works to terminate surface\nhabitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions.\n$Curiosity$ will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two\nhypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate cation composition, carbon isotopes,\nand climate change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Our system consists of two major components:\nintent detection and reply retrieval, which are very different from standard\nsmart reply systems where the task is to directly predict a reply.

Reply retrieval utilizes pairings between intent and reply based on\ntheir popularity in chat messages as derived from historical data. For intent\ndetection, a set of embedding and classification techniques are experimented\nwith, and we choose to deploy a solution using unsupervised distributed\nembedding and nearest-neighbor classifier. It has the advantage of only\nrequiring a small amount of labeled training data, simplicity in developing and\ndeploying to production, and fast inference during serving and hence highly\nscalable. At the same time, it performs comparably with deep learning\narchitectures such as word-level convolutional neural network. Overall, the\nsystem achieves a high accuracy of 76% on intent detection.

The wave-induced misbalance between plasma cooling and heating\nprocesses causes the amplification or attenuation, and also dispersion, of slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves. The wave dispersion could be attributed to the presence\nof characteristic time scales in the system, connected with the plasma heating\nor cooling due to the competition of the heating and cooling processes in the\nvicinity of the thermal equilibrium. We analysed linear slow magnetoacoustic\nwaves in a plasma in a thermal equilibrium formed by a balance of optically\nthin radiative losses, field-align thermal conduction, and an unspecified\nheating. The dispersion is manifested by the dependence of the effective\nadiabatic index of the wave on the wave frequency, making the phase and group\nspeeds frequency-dependent. The mutual effect of the wave amplification and\ndispersion is shown to result into the occurrence of an oscillatory pattern in\nan initially broadband slow wave, with the characteristic period determined by\nthe thermal misbalance time scales, i.e. by the derivatives of the combined\nradiation loss and heating function with respect to the density and\ntemperature, evaluated at the equilibrium. This effect is illustrated by\nestimating the characteristic period of the oscillatory pattern, appearing\nbecause of thermal misbalance in the plasma of the solar corona. It is found\nthat by an order of magnitude the period is about the typical periods of slow\nmagnetoacoustic oscillations detected in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Alternatively, for $e_{B} < 0.1$ or $q \\sim 1$,\nthe nominal location of the MMR $1~:~3$ is the closest stable region. The\npresence of a} giant planet increases the region of forbidden polar\nconfigurations around low mass ratio binaries with eccentricities $e_B\\sim0.4$\nwith respect to rocky earth-like planets. For equal mass stars, the\neccentricity excitation $\\Delta e$ of polar orbits smoothly increases with\ndecreasing distance to the binary. For $q<1$, $\\Delta e$ can reach values as\nhigh as $0.4$. Finally, we studied polar configurations around $HD~98800BaBb$\nand show that the region of stability is strongly affected by the relative\npositions of the nodes. The most stable configurations in the system correspond\nto polar particles, which are not expected to survive on longer time-scales due\nto the presence of the external perturber HD~$98800AaAb$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Here we draw attention to the fact that while the\n(quasi-)steady discs in dwarf novae in outburst are in agreement with the\nexpected emission distribution, the steady discs in the nova-like variables are\nnot. We note that essentially the only difference between these two sets of\ndiscs is the time for which they have been in the high viscosity, high\naccretion rate state. In such discs, the major process by which angular\nmomentum is transported outwards is MHD turbulence. We speculate that such\nturbulence gives rise to corona-like structures (here called magnetically\ncontrolled zones, or MCZs) which are also able to provide non-negligible\nangular momentum transport, the magnitude of which depends on the spatial scale\n$L$ of the magnetic field structures in such zones. For short-lived, high\naccretion rate discs (such as those in dwarf novae) we expect $L \\sim H$ and\nthe MCZ to have little effect. But, with time (such as in the nova-like\nvariables) an inverse cascade in the MHD turbulence enables $L$, and the net\neffect of the MCZ, to grow. We present a simple toy model which demonstrates\nthat such ideas can provide an explanation for the difference between the dwarf\nnovae and the nova-like variable discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

This shaping is difficult to specify by\nhand, particularly when the task is learned from raw observations, such as\nimages. In this paper, we study how we can automatically learn dynamical\ndistances: a measure of the expected number of time steps to reach a given goal\nstate from any other state. These dynamical distances can be used to provide\nwell-shaped reward functions for reaching new goals, making it possible to\nlearn complex tasks efficiently. We show that dynamical distances can be used\nin a semi-supervised regime, where unsupervised interaction with the\nenvironment is used to learn the dynamical distances, while a small amount of\npreference supervision is used to determine the task goal, without any manually\nengineered reward function or goal examples.

The proton bound-state amplitude is solved for using\nthe Faddeev equation in a quark-diquark approximation, including both dynamical\nscalar and axial vector diquarks. GPDs are calculated using a dressed non-local\ncorrelator, consistent with DCSB, which is obtained by solving a Bethe-Salpeter\nequation. The model and approximations used observe Lorentz covariance, and as\na consequence the GPDs obey polynomiality sum rules. Extractions of\nelectromagnetic and gravitational form factors are performed. We find a D-term\nof $-1.08$ when the non-local correlator is properly dressed, and $0.85$ when\nthe bare correlator is used instead, suggesting that within this framework\nproton stability requires the constituent quarks to be dressed consistently\nwith DCSB.

Additionally, structured discrete domains are\noften characterized by strict constraints on what constitutes a valid object\nand generative models must respect these requirements in order to produce\nuseful novel samples. Here, we present a generative model for discrete objects\nemploying a Markov chain where transitions are restricted to a set of local\noperations that preserve validity. Building off of generative interpretations\nof denoising autoencoders, the Markov chain alternates between producing 1) a\nsequence of corrupted objects that are valid but not from the data\ndistribution, and 2) a learned reconstruction distribution that attempts to fix\nthe corruptions while also preserving validity.

A key strategic challenge for astronomy in\nthis era is the lack of suitable spectroscopic followup facilities. In response\nto this need, we have developed the PolyOculus approach for producing\nlarge-area-equivalent telescopes by using fiber optics to link modules of\nmultiple semi-autonomous, small, inexpensive, commercial-off-the-shelf\ntelescopes. Crucially, this scalable design has construction costs which are\n$>10x$ lower than equivalent traditional large-area telescopes. In addition,\nPolyOculus is inherently highly automated and well-suited for remote\noperations. Development of this technology will enable the expansion of major\nresearch efforts in the LSST era to a host of smaller universities and\ncolleges, including primarily-undergraduate institutions, for budgets\nconsistent with their educational expenditures on similar facilities.

Also, the predicted NS-NS merger rates are\ntypically lower than the rates inferred from the LIGO GW170817 event. Here, we\ninvestigate merger rates of NS and black hole (BH)-NS binaries in hierarchical\ntriple-star systems. In such systems, the tertiary can induce Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations in the inner binary, accelerating its coalescence, and potentially\nenhancing compact object merger rates. However, since compact objects originate\nfrom massive stars, the prior evolution should also be taken into account.\nNatal kicks, in particular, could significantly reduce the rates by unbinding\nthe tertiary before it can affect the inner binary through LK evolution. We\ncarry out simulations of massive triples taking into account stellar evolution\nstarting from the main sequence, secular and tidal evolution, and the effects\nof supernovae. For large NS birth kicks (\\sigma_k = 265 km/s), we find that the\ntriple NS-NS merger rate (several hundred Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is lower by a\nfactor of ~2-3 than the binary rate, but for no kicks (\\sigma_k = 0 km/s), the\ntriple rate (several thousand Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is comparable to the binary\nrate. Our results indicate that a significant fraction of NS-NS mergers could\noriginate from triples if a substantial portion of the NS population is born\nwith low kick velocities, as indicated by other work. However, uncertainties\nand open questions remain because of our simplifying assumption of dynamical\ndecoupling after inner binary interaction has been triggered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 21:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 14:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In particular, the architecture first acquires options in a\nfully autonomous fashion on the basis of open-ended learning, then builds a\nPDDL domain based on symbols and operators that can be used to accomplish\nuser-defined goals through a standard PDDL planner.\n  We start from an implementation of the above mentioned procedure tested on a\nset of benchmark domains in which a humanoid robot can change the state of some\nobjects through direct interaction with the environment. We then investigate\nsome critical aspects of the information abstraction process that have been\nobserved, and propose an extension that mitigates such criticalities, in\nparticular by analysing the type of classifiers that allow a suitable grounding\nof symbols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 22:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

Through Spearman\nrank correlation we found that the gamma-ray variability is correlated with a\nparticular region (feature B, in the MOJAVE images) downstream from the\nobserved base (core) of the jet. This jet component is, therefore, a likely\nlocation at which an important fraction of the variable gamma-ray emission is\nproduced. We also calculated the average proper motion of the component with\nrespect to the VLBA core and found that it moves at an apparent superluminal\nvelocity of $(3.70 \\pm 0.35)c$, implying that one of the gamma-ray emission\nzones is not stationary.

Metasurfaces are spatial arrangements of\nengineered scatters that may enable this light manipulation capability with\nunprecedented resolution.

Under fair air conditions,\nif the near-surface atmospheric electrostatic field Ez (oriented down when it\nis positive) presents a very stable negative anomaly (from -100 V/m to -5000\nV/m), it will forebode that an earthquake (seismicity from 3-8) would take\nplace in the next several to tens of hours within a distance less than 100 km.\nWe name this prediction technique as \"DC Ez Determination\"(DED). In addition,\nthe mechanism of such abnormal quasi-static electric field before a forthcoming\nearthquake has been proposed here: (1) Radon gas releases from the rock clefts\nnear the epicenter during seismogenic process. (2) {\\alpha} particles are\nproduced due to the radioactive decay of Radon gas in the air. (3) {\\alpha}\nparticle ionizing radiation creates more positive particles in the air, which\nis much more effective than that {\\beta} and {\\gamma} particles produced during\nRadon radioactive decay.

In video understanding,\ntemporal information is at the core of many current challenges, including\ncompression, efficient inference, motion estimation or summarization. However,\nin current video datasets it has been observed that action classes can often be\nrecognized without any temporal information from a single frame of video. As a\nresult, both benchmarking and training in these datasets may give an\nunintentional advantage to models with strong image understanding capabilities,\nas opposed to those with strong temporal understanding. In this paper we\naddress this problem head on by identifying action classes where temporal\ninformation is actually necessary to recognize them and call these \"temporal\nclasses\". Selecting temporal classes using a computational method would bias\nthe process. Instead, we propose a methodology based on a simple and effective\nhuman annotation experiment. We remove just the temporal information by\nshuffling frames in time and measure if the action can still be recognized.\nClasses that cannot be recognized when frames are not in order are included in\nthe temporal Dataset. We observe that this set is statistically different from\nother static classes, and that performance in it correlates with a network's\nability to capture temporal information. Thus we use it as a benchmark on\ncurrent popular networks, which reveals a series of interesting facts. We also\nexplore the effect of training on the temporal dataset, and observe that this\nleads to better generalization in unseen classes, demonstrating the need for\nmore temporal data.

This algebraic equation possesses roots\nwhose expressions can be given explicitly in terms of radicals. We obtain this\nresult by using an enumerative combinatorics approach.

Our results span data structure\nupper bounds, cryptographic applications, and data structure lower bounds, as\nsummarized next.\n  First, we apply Fiat--Naor inversion, a technique with cryptographic origins,\nto obtain a data structure upper bound. In particular, our technique yields a\nsuite of algorithms with space $S$ and (online) time $T$ for a preprocessing\nversion of the $N$-input 3SUM problem where $S^3\\cdot T = \\widetilde{O}(N^6)$.\nThis disproves a strong conjecture (Goldstein et al., WADS 2017) that there is\nno data structure that solves this problem for $S=N^{2-\\delta}$ and $T =\nN^{1-\\delta}$ for any constant $\\delta>0$.\n  Secondly, we show equivalence between lower bounds for a broad class of\n(static) data structure problems and one-way functions in the random oracle\nmodel that resist a very strong form of preprocessing attack. Concretely, given\na random function $F: [N] \\to [N]$ (accessed as an oracle) we show how to\ncompile it into a function $G^F: [N^2] \\to [N^2]$ which resists $S$-bit\npreprocessing attacks that run in query time $T$ where\n$ST=O(N^{2-\\varepsilon})$ (assuming a corresponding data structure lower bound\non 3SUM). In contrast, a classical result of Hellman tells us that $F$ itself\ncan be more easily inverted, say with $N^{2/3}$-bit preprocessing in $N^{2/3}$\ntime. We also show that much stronger lower bounds follow from the hardness of\nkSUM. Our results can be equivalently interpreted as security against\nadversaries that are very non-uniform, or have large auxiliary input, or as\nsecurity in the face of a powerfully backdoored random oracle.\n  Thirdly, we give non-adaptive lower bounds for 3SUM and a range of geometric\nproblems which match the best known lower bounds for static data structure\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 03:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 23:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 20:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

This insight leads to an interesting opportunity for\nquantitatively observing how quantum coherence is affected by many-body\ninteraction that is switched on for a varying duration prior to adiabatic\npumping. In particular, interband coherence effects can be clearly observed by\nadjusting the switch-on rates with different adiabatic pumping protocols and by\nscanning the duration of many-body interaction prior to adiabatic pumping. The\ntime dependence of single-particle interband coherence in the presence of\nmany-body interaction can then be examined in detail.

This is an essential component in order to mitigate\nintentional model overfitting by model-improving peers.

However, this approach can be problematic in many cases. In\nparticular, it does not provide a direct way to capitalize the richness of hand\nmovement variability within a consistent and unified representation.

Unlike\nstandard approaches to mouse-tracking, our proposal uses stochastic state-space\nmodeling to represent the observed trajectories in terms of both individual\nmovement dynamics and experimental variables.

As the equipment becomes connected and technical\ninfrastructure evolves, business models and risk management need to adapt. In\nthis paper, we present a study on how changes in asset and risk distribution\nare evolving for the actors in a software ecosystem (SECO) and\nsystem-of-systems (SoS) around a mining operation. We have performed a survey\nto understand how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) -- a common mechanism for\nmanaging risk -- are used in other domains. Furthermore, we have performed a\nfocus group study with companies. There is an overall trend in the mining\nindustry to move the investment cost (CAPEX) from the mining operator to the\nvendors. Hence, the mining operator instead leases the equipment (as\noperational expense, OPEX) or even acquires a service. This change in business\nmodel impacts operation, as knowledge is moved from the mining operator to the\nsuppliers. Furthermore, as the infrastructure becomes more complex, this\nimplies that the mining operator is more and more reliant on the suppliers for\nthe operation and maintenance. As this change is still in an early stage, there\nis no formalized risk management, e.g. through SLAs, in place. Rather, at\npresent, the companies in the ecosystem rely more on trust and the incentives\ncreated by the promise of mutual future benefits of innovation activities. We\nbelieve there is a need to better understand how to manage risk in SECO as it\nis established and evolves. At the same time, in a SECO, the focus is on\ncooperation and innovation, the companies do not have incentives to address\nthis unless there is an incident. Therefore, industry need, we believe, help in\nsystematically understanding risk and defining quality aspects such as\nreliability and performance in the new business environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 08:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

Different from most previous works that\ndiscard the occluded frames, STCnet can recover the appearance of the occluded\nparts. For one thing, the spatial structure of a pedestrian frame can be used\nto predict the occluded body parts from the unoccluded body parts of this\nframe. For another, the temporal patterns of pedestrian sequence provide\nimportant clues to generate the contents of occluded parts. With the\nSpatio-temporal information, STCnet can recover the appearance for the occluded\nparts, which could be leveraged with those unoccluded parts for more accurate\nvideo re-ID.

In particular, force unzipping experiments have been\nused to extract the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding and unfolding\nreactions. In hopping experiments, a molecule executes transitions between the\nunfolded and folded states at a preset value of the force (constant force mode\n-CFM- under force feedback) or trap position (passive mode -PM- without\nfeedback) and the force-dependent kinetic rates extracted from the lifetime of\neach state (CFM) and the rupture force distributions (PM) using the Bell-Evans\nmodel. However, hopping experiments in the CFM are known to overestimate\nmolecular distances and folding free energies for fast transitions compared to\nthe response time of the feedback. In contrast, kinetic rate measurements from\npulling experiments have been mostly done in the PM while the CFM is seldom\nimplemented in pulling protocols. Here, we carry out hopping and pulling\nexperiments in a short DNA hairpin in the PM and CFM at three different\ntemperatures (6$^\\circ$C, 25$^\\circ$C and 45$^\\circ$C) exhibiting largely\nvarying kinetic rates. As expected, we find that equilibrium hopping\nexperiments in the CFM and PM perform well at 6$^\\circ$C (where kinetics is\nslow) whereas the CFM overestimates molecular parameters at 45$^\\circ$C (where\nkinetics is fast). In contrast, nonequilibrium pulling experiments perform well\nin both modes at all temperatures. This demonstrates that the same kind of\nfeedback algorithm in the CFM leads to more reliable determination of the\nfolding reaction parameters in irreversible pulling experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 10:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

The\ninhibition of heterogeneous ice nucleation results in a preferential region for\ngrowth into planetesimals close to the ice line where we find large icy\npebbles.

The radio structures are consistent to be faint radio jets or lobes of\na central galaxy, whose spectrum shows nebular emission characteristic of a\ntype-II active galactic nucleus (AGN).

The detection\nof extended emission in CIV and CIII] indicates that the gas within the nebula\nis not primordial. Feedback may have enriched the halo at at least 50 kpc from\nthe nuclear region.

As the\nelementary spectra correspond to the reflectance spectra of real materials,\nthey are often very correlated yielding an ill-conditioned problem. To enrich\nthe model and to reduce ambiguity due to the high correlation, it is common to\nintroduce spatial information to complement the spectral information. The most\ncommon way to introduce spatial information is to rely on a spatial\nregularization of the abundance maps. In this paper, instead of considering a\nsimple but limited regularization process, spatial information is directly\nincorporated through the newly proposed context of spatial unmixing. Contextual\nfeatures are extracted for each pixel and this additional set of observations\nis decomposed according to a linear model. Finally the spatial and spectral\nobservations are unmixed jointly through a cofactorization model. In\nparticular, this model introduces a coupling term used to identify clusters of\nshared spatial and spectral signatures.

Within this approach, a part of\nthe system becomes informationally isolated (restricted) which leads to a\nnatural emergence of the classical domain. This measurement scenario is a\nsimpler alternative to environment-induced decoherence. In its basic version,\nMMS involves two ancilla qubits, $A$ and $X$, entangled with each other and\nwith the System $S$. Informational or thermodynamic cost of measurement is\nrepresented by $X$-qubit being isolated, i.e. becoming unavailable for future\ninteractions with the rest of the system. Conditional upon this isolation,\n$A$-qubit, that plays the role of an Apparatus, becomes classical and records\nthe outcome of the measurement. The procedure may be used to perform von\nNeumann-style projective measurements or generalized ones, that corresponds to\nPositive-Operator Value Measure (POVM). By repeating the same generalized\nmeasurement multiple times with different $A$- and $X$-qubits, one\nasymptotically approaches the wave function collapse in the basis determined by\nthe premeasurement process. We present a simple result for the total\ninformation extracted after $N$ such weak measurements. Building upon MMS, we\npropose a construction that maps a history of a quantum system onto a set of\n$A$-qubits. It resembles the Consistent History (CH) formulation of Quantum\nMechanics (QM), but is distinct from it, and is built entirely within the\nconventional QM. In particular, consistency postulate of CH formalism is not\nautomatically satisfied, but rather is an emerging property. Namely, each\nmeasurement event corresponds to the branching of mutually exclusive classical\nrealities whose probabilities are additive. In a general case, however, the\nsuperposition between different histories is determined by the history density\nmatrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 19:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this\nsetup, the goal is to design a distributed control law that steers the output\nsignals to the origin, while simultaneously driving the coordination vectors of\nthe agents of the network to consensus. To solve this, we propose a model\npredictive control scheme that builds on a pre-existing auxiliary consensus\ncontrol law to design a performance index that combines the output regulation\nobjective with the consensus objective.

If the detection method of\nradio emission were available, there is no limit of the observation like\nCherenkov counter. The developments of high radio frequency (RF) technology\nmight make the detection of radio emission from extensive air showers possible.\nAntennas calibrated in laboratory are available. With those antennas, we can\ndirectly obtain the absolute intensity of radio frequency from cosmic ray air\nshowers. Main issue to detect radio emission is that signal level is quite low.\nThe thermal noise particularly causes background noise source. Those issues and\ndetection method are discussed. We also describe an antenna detection method to\ngenerate self-trigger signal and a method to identify air shower events from\nnatural and artificial noises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 01:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

In the absence of a formal definition, most studies\noperationalize the notion of a conversation group either through a spatial or a\ntemporal lens. Spatially, the most commonly used representation is the\nF-formation, defined by social scientists as the configuration in which people\narrange themselves to sustain an interaction. However, the use of this\nrepresentation is often accompanied with the simplifying assumption that a\nsingle conversation occurs within an F-formation. Temporally, various\ncategories have been used to organize conversational units; these include,\namong others, turn, topic, and floor. Some of these concepts are hard to define\nobjectively by themselves. The present work constitutes an initial exploration\ninto unifying these perspectives by primarily posing the question: can we use\nthe observation of simultaneous speaker turns to infer whether multiple\nconversation floors exist within an F-formation? We motivate a metric for the\nexistence of distinct conversation floors based on simultaneous speaker turns,\nand provide an analysis using this metric to characterize conversations across\nF-formations of varying cardinality. We contribute two key findings: firstly,\nat the average speaking turn duration of about two seconds for humans, there is\nevidence for the existence of multiple floors within an F-formation; and\nsecondly, an increase in the cardinality of an F-formation correlates with a\ndecrease in duration of simultaneous speaking turns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 09:16:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 09:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Women are both\nunder-represented in their participation in Australian STEM education (compared\nto their fraction within the population at large), and face a much higher\nattrition rate from STEM subjects throughout secondary and tertiary education.\nEven within STEM careers the proportion of women frequently generally decreases\nwith increasing position of seniority. In 2015 organisers and members of the\nAustralian Space Research Community began to analyse the data from participants\nof the Australian Space Research Conference, in order to derive statistics\nrelating to the gender balance of the conference. In this paper, the data from\nthe most recent conference (held on the Gold Coast, in September 2018) is\nanalysed, considering the gender demographics of delegates, presenters (within\nnumerous categories), and awards. This year, we also present the dimensions of\ncareer type and academic level of conference attendees. The resulting trends\nare compared to those of other national space research conferences - the\nScientific Meeting of the Astronomical Society of Australia. The results show\nthat the representation of females dropped to the lowest levels since formal\ndata collection began in 2015, with females comprising 23% of conference\nattendees, and 21% of all session presentations (posters and talks combined).\nGender parity was achieved however amongst the invited Plenary presentations.\nRecommendations for removing some of the barriers to female participation in\nthe conference and encouraging greater gender balance and diversity in future\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 04:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 06:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

A latent fingerprint is a fingerprint left on a surface by\ndeposits of oils and/or perspiration from the finger. It is not usually visible\nto the naked eye but may be detected with special techniques such as dusting\nwith fine powder and then lifting the pattern of powder with transparent tape.\nWe have evaluated the quality of machine learning techniques that has been\nimplemented in automatic fingerprint identification. In this paper, we use\nfingerprints of low quality from database DB1 of Fingerprint Verification\nCompetition (FVC 2002) to conduct our experiments. Fingerprints are processed\nto find its core point using Poincare index and carry out enhancement using\nDiffusion coherence filter whose performance is known to be good in the high\ncurvature regions of fingerprints. Grey-level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) based\nseven statistical descriptors with four different inter pixel distances are\nthen extracted as features and put forward to train and test REPTree,\nRandomTree, J48, Decision Stump and Random Forest Machine Learning techniques\nfor personal identification. Experiments are conducted on 80 instances and 28\nattributes. Our experiments proved that Random Forests and J48 give good\nresults for latent fingerprints as compared to other machine learning\ntechniques and can help improve the identification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 22:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

As the\ncontinuous development of Deep Learning, many advanced academic and industrial\noutcomes are established on localising and classifying the target objects, such\nas instance segmentation, video tracking and robotic vision. As the core\nconcept of Deep Learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and associated training\nare highly integrated with task-driven modelling, having great effects on\naccurate detection. The main focus of improving detection performance is\nproposing DNNs with extra layers and novel topological connections to extract\nthe desired features from input data. However, training these models can be\ncomputationally expensive and laborious progress as the complicated model\narchitecture and enormous parameters. Besides, the dataset is another reason\ncausing this issue and low detection accuracy, because of insufficient data\nsamples or difficult instances. To address these training difficulties, this\nthesis presents two different approaches to improve the detection performance\nin the relatively light-weight way. As the intrinsic feature of data-driven in\ndeep learning, the first approach is \"slot-based image augmentation\" to enrich\nthe dataset with extra foreground and background combinations. Instead of the\ncommonly used image flipping method, the proposed system achieved similar mAP\nimprovement with less extra images which decrease training time. This proposed\naugmentation system has extra flexibility adapting to various scenarios and the\nperformance-driven analysis provides an alternative aspect of conducting image\naugmentation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 13:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}
