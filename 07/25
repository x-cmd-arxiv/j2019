When latency is\nless of a concern, we computed the latency-corrected accuracy which is 100% for\nour testing data, significantly improved from LSTM without constraint which is\n96.2%. The balance between robustness and responsiveness can be considered and\nadjusted on a case-by-case basis, according to the specific needs of downstream\nclinical applications.

Knowing the angular information of their dominant paths, we can develop\nvarious applications, such as the prediction of link performance and the\ntracking of an 802.11ad device. Although they are equipped with phased arrays,\nthe angular inference for 802.11ad devices is still challenging due to their\nlimited number of RF chains and limited phase control capabilities. Considering\nthe beam sweeping operation and the high communication bandwidth of 802.11ad\ndevices, we propose variation-based angle estimation (VAE), called VAE-CIR, by\nutilizing beam-specific channel impulse responses (CIRs) measured under\ndifferent beams and the directional gains of the corresponding beams to infer\nthe angular information of dominant paths. Unlike state-of-the-arts, VAE-CIR\nexploits the variations between different beam-specific CIRs, instead of their\nabsolute values, for angular inference. To evaluate the performance of VAE-CIR,\nwe generate the beam-specific CIRs by simulating the beam sweeping of 802.11ad\ndevices with the beam patterns measured on off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices. The\n60GHz channel is generated via a ray-tracing simulator and the CIRs are\nextracted via channel estimation based on Golay sequences.

Direct measurements of the helicity and magnetic free\nenergy in the coronal volume are difficult, but their values may be estimated\nfrom measurements of the helicity and free energy transport rates through the\nphotosphere. We examine these transport rates for a topologically open system\nsuch as the corona, in which the magnetic fields have a nonzero normal\ncomponent at the boundaries, and derive a new formula for the helicity\ntransport rate at the boundaries. In addition, we derive new expressions for\nhelicity transport due to flux emergence/submergence versus photospheric\nhorizontal motions. The key feature of our formulas is that they are manifestly\ngauge invariant. Our results are somewhat counterintuitive in that only the\nlamellar electric field produced by the surface potential transports helicity\nacross boundaries, and the solenoidal electric field produced by a surface\nstream function does not contribute to the helicity transport. We discuss the\nphysical interpretation of this result. Furthermore, we derive an expression\nfor the free energy transport rate and show that a necessary condition for free\nenergy transport across a boundary is the presence of a closed magnetic field\nat the surface, indicating that there are current systems within the volume. We\ndiscuss the implications of these results for using photospheric vector\nmagnetic and velocity field measurements to derive the solar coronal helicity\nand magnetic free energy, which can then be used to constrain and drive models\nfor coronal activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

These\nresults are in some tension with theoretical expectations of galaxy formation\nmodels, in which rapid black hole growth occurs within a short time of a major\nmerger. Type 2 quasar candidates are less luminous, so they may instead be\npowered by internal galactic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

We report on a detailed X-ray spectral\nstudy of the persistent neutron star low mass X-ray binary 1RXS\nJ170854.4-321857. We analysed two XMM-Newton observations obtained in late 2004\nand early 2005 when, in agreement with previous studies, the system displayed\nan X-ray luminosity (0.5-10 keV) of ~1 x 10^36 erg s-1. The spectrum can be\ndescribed by a Comptonized emission component with Gamma~1.9 and a distribution\nof seed photons with a temperature of ~ 0.23 keV. A prominent residual feature\nis present at soft energies, which is reproduced by the absorption model if\nover-abundances of Ne and Fe are allowed. We discuss how similar observables,\nthat might be attributed to the peculiar (non-solar) composition of the plasma\ndonated by the companion star, are a common feature in confirmed and candidate\nultra-compact systems. Although this interpretation is still under debate, we\nconclude that the detection of these features along with the persistent nature\nof the source at such low luminosity and the intermediate-long burst that it\ndisplayed in the past confirms 1RXS J170854.4-321857as a solid ultra-compact\nX-ray binary candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 18:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

Apsidal alignment is\nsurprising, especially for dust. Even when born from an apse-aligned ring of\nparent bodies, dust grains have their periastra dispersed in all directions by\nstellar radiation pressure. The periastra cannot be re-oriented by planets\nwithin the short dust lifetimes at the bottom of the collisional cascade. We\npropose that what re-aligns dust orbits is drag exerted by second-generation\ngas. Gas is largely immune to radiation pressure, and when released by\nphotodesorption or collisions within an eccentric ring of parent bodies should\noccupy a similarly eccentric, apse-aligned ring. Dust grains launched onto\nmisaligned orbits cross the eccentric gas ring supersonically and can become\ndragged into alignment within collisional lifetimes.

However, recent\nadvances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on\nvariants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have\ntruly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious\nbiases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities\nof machine commonsense. To investigate this question, we introduce WinoGrande,\na large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design, but\nadjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset.

We find two distinctive\nemission morphologies: N$_2$H$^+$ is either present in a bright, narrow ring\nsurrounded by extended tenuous emission, or in a broad ring. These emission\npatterns can be explained by two different kinds of vertical temperature\nstructures.

We use a simple model to extract the first sets of CO and N$_2$\nsnowline pairs and corresponding freeze-out temperatures towards the disks with\na thick VIRaM layer.

Moreover,\nAGB envelopes are a common place where gas molecules condense to form\nnanoparticles (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and large grains. In\nthis paper, we will study whether electric dipole emission from rapidly\nspinning nanoparticles can reproduce the AME observed toward AGB stars. To\nproperly model the size distribution of nanoparticles in the AGB envelope, we\ntake into account both the increase of nanoparticles due to rotational\ndisruption of large grains spun-up by radiative torques and the decrease of\nsmallest nanoparticles due to rotational disruption driven by stochastic gas\ncollisions. We then perform detailed modeling of microwave emission from\nrapidly spinning nanoparticles from both C-rich and O-rich AGB envelopes using\nthe grain size distribution constrained by rotational disruption. We find that\nspinning dust emission is dominant over thermal dust emission at frequencies\nbelow 100 GHz. We attempt to fit the observational data of AME using our\nspinning dust model and demonstrate that spinning dust can reproduce the\nobserved AME in six AGB stars. Finally, we discuss that microwave emission from\nspinning dust in AGB envelopes could be observed with high-resolution upcoming\nradio telescopes such as ngVLA and ALMA Band 1. This would be a major leap for\nunderstanding AGB envelopes, formation, evolution, and internal structures of\ndust. Observations would help to distinguish the carrier of AME from comparing\nC-rich to O-rich stars, because PAHs are formed in C-rich AGB stars while\nsilicates are formed in O-rich stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 18:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 03:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 13:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

External validation studies measure both\nself-reported outcomes and an accompanying biomarker, and can therefore be used\nfor measurement error correction. Most validation data, though, are only\nrelevant for outcomes under control conditions. Statistical methods have been\ndeveloped to use external validation data to correct for outcome measurement\nerror under control, and then conduct sensitivity analyses around the error\nunder treatment to obtain estimates of the corrected average treatment effect.\nHowever, an assumption underlying this approach is that the measurement error\nstructure of the outcome is the same in both the validation sample and the\nintervention trial, so that the error correction is transportable to the trial.\nThis may not always be a valid assumption to make. In this paper, we propose an\napproach that adjusts the validation sample to better resemble the trial sample\nand thus leads to more transportable measurement error corrections. We also\nformally investigate when bias due to poor transportability may arise. Lastly,\nwe examine the method performance using simulation, and illustrate them using\nPREMIER, a multi-arm lifestyle intervention trial measuring self-reported\nsodium intake as an outcome, and OPEN, a validation study that measures both\nself-reported diet and urinary biomarkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 20:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 16:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 19:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

The criteria and routes of escape in one-degree of freedom\nsystems has been well studied theoretically with reasonable agreement with\nexperiment. The trajectory can only transit from the hilltop of the\none-dimensional potential energy surface. The situation becomes more\ncomplicated when the system has higher degrees of freedom since it has multiple\nroutes to escape through an equilibrium of saddle-type, specifically, an\nindex-1 saddle. This paper summarizes the geometry of escape across a saddle in\nsome widely known physical systems with two degrees of freedom and establishes\nthe criteria of escape providing both a methodology and results under the\nconceptual framework known as tube dynamics. These problems are classified into\ntwo categories based on whether the saddle projection and focus projection in\nthe symplectic eigenspace are coupled or not when damping and/or gyroscopic\neffects are considered. To simplify the process, only the linearized system\naround the saddle points are analyzed.

The\nEvryscope array of telescopes has observed all bright nearby stars in the\nSouth, producing two-minute cadence light curves since 2016. Long-term,\nhigh-cadence observations of rotating flare stars probe the complex\nrelationship between stellar rotation, starspots, and superflares. We detect\nperiods from 0.3487 to 104 d, and observe amplitudes from 0.008 to 0.216 g'\nmag. We find the Evryscope amplitudes are larger than those in TESS with the\neffect correlated to stellar mass (p-value=0.01). We compute the Rossby number\n(Ro), and find our sample selected for flaring has twice as many intermediate\nrotators (0.04<Ro<0.4) as fast (Ro<0.04) or slow (Ro>0.44) rotators; this may\nbe astrophysical or a result of period-detection sensitivity. We discover 30\nfast, 59 intermediate, and 33 slow rotators. We measure a median starspot\ncoverage of 13% of the stellar hemisphere and constrain the minimum magnetic\nfield strength consistent with our flare energies and spot coverage to be 500\nG, with later-type stars exhibiting lower values than earlier-types. We observe\na possible change in superflare rates at intermediate periods. However, we do\nnot conclusively confirm the increased activity of intermediate rotators seen\nin previous studies. We split all rotators at Ro~0.2 into Prot<10 d and Prot>10\nd bins to confirm short-period rotators exhibit higher superflare rates, larger\nflare energies, and higher starspot coverage than do long-period rotators, at\np-values of 3.2 X 10^-5, 1.0 X 10^-5, and 0.01, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 21:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-10"}

For instance, to achieve\ndistributed consensus in the presence of adversaries, the underlying network\ngraph needs to satisfy certain robustness conditions. A typical approach to\nmaking networks structurally robust is to strategically add extra links between\nnodes, which might be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative way of improving network's robustness, that is by considering\nheterogeneity of nodes. Nodes in a network can be of different types and can\nhave multiple variants. As a result, different nodes can have disjoint sets of\nvulnerabilities, which means that an attacker can only compromise a particular\ntype of nodes by exploiting a particular vulnerability. We show that, by such a\ndiversification of nodes, attacker's ability to change the underlying network\nstructure is significantly reduced. Consequently, even a sparse network with\nheterogeneous nodes can exhibit the properties of a structurally robust\nnetwork. Using these ideas, we propose a distributed control policy that\nutilizes heterogeneity in the network to achieve resilient consensus in\nadversarial environment. We extend the notion of $(r,s)$-robustness to\nincorporate the diversity of nodes and provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions to guarantee resilient distributed consensus in heterogeneous\nnetworks. Finally we study the properties and construction of robust graphs\nwith heterogeneous nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 21:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

However, the sampled softmax\nprovides a biased estimate of the gradient unless the samples are drawn from\nthe exact softmax distribution, which is again expensive to compute. Therefore,\na widely employed practical approach involves sampling from a simpler\ndistribution in the hope of approximating the exact softmax distribution.

Recent fluorescence\nmicroscopy experiments allow for the counting of organelles at the single-cell\nlevel. These measurements provide information about the cell-to-cell\nvariability in organelle abundance in addition to the mean level.

The system employs\nquantum correlation of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC). The signal, if present, will perturb the flux of the\nincident photon stream. The perturbed photon stream is first projected through\na birefringent crystal where SPDC occurs, converting a single high-energy\nphoton into a pair of low energy photons. The photons in each pair eventually\narrive at separate detectors. By examining the biphoton correlation using the\nprobability distribution of the photons at the detectors, which varies\ndepending on the displacement of the main pump photon stream and the change in\nthe number of photons, the small optical displacement of the photon stream and\nits variance can be determined. The change in incident photon number, in other\nwords, the presence of light signal does not influence the average of the\nmeasured optical displacement values. Nevertheless, the change in optical\ndisplacement measurement variance when the number of incident photons has\nchanged detects the light signal. This optical setup enables the detection of\nlight signals with low noise and remarkably high precision and sensitivity\nusing quantum correlation.

The\nstructures required for MFMO calculations were obtained from molecular dynamics\nsimulations and cluster analysis. Attractive dispersion interactions were\nobserved between 17$\\beta$-estradiol and the binding site hydrophobic residues.\nIn addition, strong electrostatic interactions were found between\n17$\\beta$-estradiol and the following charged/polarized residues: Glu 353, His\n524 and Arg 394. The FMO2-RHF/STO-3G:MP2/6-31G(d) weighted binding energy was\nof -67.2 kcal/mol.

A more general multivariable\nsetting of recent interest for these ideas is the case where (i) the unit disk\nis replaced by a certain domain contained in ${\\mathbb C}^3$ (called the {\\em\ntetrablock}), (ii) the contraction operator $T$ is replaced by a commutative\ntriple $(T_1, T_2, T)$ of Hilbert-space operators having ${\\mathbb E}$ as a\nspectral set (a tetrablock contraction) . The rational dilation question for\nthis setting is whether a tetrablock contraction $(T_1, T_2, T)$ can be lifted\nto a tetrablock isometry $(V_1, V_2, V)$ (a commutative operator tuple which\nextends to a tetrablock-unitary tuple $(U_1, U_2, U)$---a commutative tuple of\nnormal operators with joint spectrum contained in the distinguished boundary of\nthe tetrablock). We discuss necessary conditions for a tetrablock contraction\nto have a tetrablock-isometric lift. We present an example of a tetrablock\ncontraction which does have a tetrablock-isometric lift but violates a\ncondition previously thought to be necessary for the existence of such a lift.\nThus the question of whether a tetrablock contraction always has a\ntetrablock-isometric lift appears to be unresolved at this time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 04:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

This framework leads to real-time control of the system such that a\nfeasible output trajectory can be tracked by the inputs. Unlike existing\nmodel-free or data-driven control approaches, this framework guarantees\nnonlinear stability. The controller and observer designs in the proposed\nframework are nonlinearly stable and robust to the unknown dynamics as well as\nunknown measurement noise. For ease of computer implementation, the framework\nis developed in discrete time. Nonlinear stability analyses of the\ndiscrete-time observers and controllers are carried out using discrete Lyapunov\nanalysis. The unknown input-output dynamics is learnt in real time using a\nnonlinearly stable observer from prior input-output history. This observer\nensures finite-time stable convergence of model estimation errors to zero if\nthe unknown model is constant, and model estimation errors converge to a\nbounded neighborhood of the zero vector if the model has bounded change in\ndiscrete time. Measured outputs are filtered by a finite-time stable observer\nbefore use in feedback tracking of a desired output trajectory. Finite-time\nstable observer design in this framework also ensures that a nonlinear\nseparation principle is in effect for separate controller and observer design.\nA model-free nonlinearly stable control scheme is then designed to ensure\nconvergence of observed outputs to a desired output trajectory. This control\nscheme ensures nonlinear finite-time stable convergence of tracking errors to a\nmanifold where the tracking errors decay asymptotically. A numerical experiment\non a nonlinear second-order system demonstrates the performance of this\nnonlinear model-free control framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 05:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 11:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 18:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

The\ngravitational-wave transient searches mainly categories into two families:\nmodeled and modeled-independent searches. The modeled searches are based on\nmatched filtering techniques and model-independent searches are based on the\nextraction of excess power from time-frequency representations. We have\nproposed a hybrid method, called wavegraph that mixes the two approaches. It\nuses astrophysical information at the extraction stage of model-independent\nsearch using a mathematical graph. In this work, we assess the performance of\nwavegraph clustering in real LIGO and Virgo noises (the sixth science run and\nthe first observing run) and using the coherent WaveBurst transient search as a\nbackbone. Further, we propose a new signal consistency test for this algorithm.\nThis test uses the amplitude profile information to distinguish between the\ngravitational wave transients from the noisy glitches. This test is able to\nremove a large fraction of loud glitches, which thus results in additional\noverall sensitivity in the context of searches for binary black-hole mergers in\nthe low-mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 06:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 05:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Using a fully\nBayesian joint modelling approach it overcomes the issue of uncongeniality\nwhile retaining the attractive flexibility of fully conditional specification\nmultiple imputation by specifying the joint distribution of analysis and\nimputation models as a sequence of univariate models that can be adapted to the\ntype of variable. JointAI provides functions for Bayesian inference with\ngeneralized linear and generalized linear mixed models and extensions thereof\nas well as survival models and joint models for longitudinal and survival data,\nthat take arguments analogous to corresponding well known functions for the\nanalysis of complete data from base R and other packages. Usage and features of\nJointAI are described and illustrated using various examples and the\ntheoretical background is outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 07:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 10:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 08:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

We have in mind a development of the study describing\nsuper-high mobility electrons in suspended samples without chemical doping. As\nfar as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the\nCoulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering\npotentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by\nthe close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter\nof circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The\nempty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical\nshortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the\ncircumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well.

We\nconsider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit\nformulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae\nfor calculation of observables.

In the case of a fixed\ndirected graph, by introducing an integrate term in the auxiliary variable\ndesign, the final consensus equilibrium can be explicitly derived.

In Suzuki (2018), assuming the scale invariance\nof activation functions, the tight generalization error bound of deep learning\nwas derived.

In our set-up, a half-meter wide ellipsoid filled with water is\nbrought to solid body rotation, and then undergoes sustained harmonic\nmodulation of its rotation rate. This triggers the exponential growth of a pair\nof inertial waves via a mechanism called the libration-driven elliptical\ninstability. Once the saturation of this instability is reached, we observe a\nturbulent state for which energy is injected into the resonant inertial waves\nonly. Depending on the amplitude of the rotation rate modulation, two different\nsaturation states are observed. At large forcing amplitudes, the saturation\nflow mainly consists of a steady, geostrophic anticyclone. Its amplitude\nvanishes as the forcing amplitude is decreased while remaining above the\nthreshold of the elliptical instability. Below this secondary transition, the\nsaturation flow is a superposition of inertial waves which are in weakly\nnon-linear resonant interaction, a state that could asymptotically lead to\ninertial wave turbulence. In addition to being a first experimental observation\nof a wave-dominated saturation in unstable rotating flows, the present study is\nalso an experimental confirmation of the model of Le Reun et al, PRL (2017) who\nintroduced the possibility of these two turbulent regimes.

This led\nto the development of new research and efficient solving systems for ELPs. In\npractice, ELPs are often written in a modular way, where each module interacts\nwith other modules by accepting sets of facts as input, and passing on sets of\nfacts as output. An interesting question then presents itself: under which\nconditions can such a module be replaced by another one without changing the\noutcome, for any set of input facts? This problem is known as uniform\nequivalence, and has been studied extensively for ASP. For ELPs, however, such\nan investigation is, as of yet, missing. In this paper, we therefore propose a\ncharacterization of uniform equivalence that can be directly applied to the\nlanguage of state-of-the-art ELP solvers.

As is well-known, for dynamical dark energy models, dark\nenergy perturbations get sourced into matter perturbations through metric\nperturbations which is always accompanied by the term $(1+w_{DE})$. Hence, for\ndynamical dark energy models with $w_{DE}$ close $-1$, their perturbations get\nalmost decoupled from metric leaving nearly null imprints on matter power\nspectra. Furthermore, Quintessence models with its sound speed equal to speed\nof light, washes out almost any inhomogeneities occurred within sub-Hubble\nscales, hence making detectability of dark energy perturbations far more\ndifficult than already is. In this article we look for these imprints by going\nbeyond Quintessence considering an Early Dark Energy parametrization that not\nonly have a non-negligible energy density at early times, but also it can\nachieve $w_{DE}$ far from $-1$, making dark energy perturbations detectable in\nsub-horizon scales. With the help of current datasets, we are able to constrain\nsound speed of dark energy to a low value ($c^2_{sDE} \\sim 0.14$), along with a\nmuch higher range allowed for early dark energy density, with strong\nconstraints on it ($\\Omega_e \\sim 0.02$).

An interesting question is if we\ncan achieve state-of-the-art performance with AEs while retaining their good\nproperties. We propose an answer to this question by introducing a new model\ncalled Y-Autoencoder (Y-AE). The structure and training procedure of a Y-AE\nenclose a representation into an implicit and an explicit part. The implicit\npart is similar to the output of an autoencoder and the explicit part is\nstrongly correlated with labels in the training set. The two parts are\nseparated in the latent space by splitting the output of the encoder into two\npaths (forming a Y shape) before decoding and re-encoding. We then impose a\nnumber of losses, such as reconstruction loss, and a loss on dependence between\nthe implicit and explicit parts. Additionally, the projection in the explicit\nmanifold is monitored by a predictor, that is embedded in the encoder and\ntrained end-to-end with no adversarial losses.

It is\nfrequently assumed as constant over time although this assumption often does\nnot hold. When the hazard ratio deviates considerably from being constant, the\naverage of its plausible values is not a valid measure of the treatment effect,\ncan be clinically misleading and common sample size formulas are not\nappropriate.\n  In this paper, we study the hazard ratio along time of a two-component\ncomposite endpoint under the assumption that the hazard ratio for each\ncomponent is constant.\n  This work considers two measures for quantifying the non-proportionality of\nthe hazard ratio: the difference $D$ between the maximum and minimum values of\nhazard ratio over time and the relative measure $R$ representing the ratio\nbetween the sample sizes for the minimum detectable and the average effects. We\nillustrate $D$ and $R$ by means of the ZODIAC trial where the primary endpoint\nwas progression-free survival.\n  We have run a simulation study deriving scenarios for different values of the\nhazard ratios, different event rates and different degrees of association\nbetween the components. We illustrate situations that yield non-constant hazard\nratios for the composite endpoints and consider the likely impact on sample\nsize.\n  Results show that the distance between the two component hazard ratios plays\nan important role, especially when they are close to 1. Furthermore, even when\nthe treatment effects for each component are similar, if the two-component\nhazards are markedly different, hazard ratio of the composite is often\nnon-constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 11:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

This framework bounds from above the largest value of\nan observable along trajectories that start from a chosen set and evolve over a\nfinite or infinite time interval. The approach needs no explicit trajectories.\nInstead, it requires constructing suitably constrained auxiliary functions that\ndepend on the state variables and possibly on time. Minimizing bounds over\nauxiliary functions is a convex problem dual to the non-convex maximization of\nthe observable along trajectories. This duality is strong, meaning that\nauxiliary functions give arbitrarily sharp bounds, for sufficiently regular\nODEs evolving over a finite time on a compact domain. When these conditions\nfail, strong duality may or may not hold; both situations are illustrated by\nexamples. We also show that near-optimal auxiliary functions can be used to\nconstruct spacetime sets that localize trajectories leading to extreme events.\nFinally, in the case of polynomial ODEs and observables, we describe how\npolynomial auxiliary functions of fixed degree can be optimized numerically\nusing polynomial optimization. The corresponding bounds become sharp as the\npolynomial degree is raised if strong duality and mild compactness assumptions\nhold.

Isotopic enrichment of spin-zero nuclei such as $^{28}$Si has\nled to spectacular improvements of the dephasing time $T_2^*$ which,\nsurprisingly, can extend two orders of magnitude beyond theoretical\nexpectations. Using a single-atom $^{31}$P qubit in enriched $^{28}$Si, we show\nthat the abnormally long $T_2^*$ is due to the controllable freezing of the\ndynamics of the residual $^{29}$Si nuclei close to the donor. Our conclusions\nare supported by a nearly parameter-free modeling of the $^{29}$Si nuclear spin\ndynamics, which reveals the degree of back-action provided by the electron spin\nas it interacts with the nuclear bath.

Labeled Transition\nSystems with inputs and outputs (LTSs), as studied in ioco testing theory,\nprovide a richer framework for testing component oriented systems, but lack the\nalgorithms for test generation from FSM theory.\n  In this article, we propose an algorithm for the fundamental problem of state\nidentification during testing of LTSs.

Analogous to the result of Lee & Yannakakis, we\nprove that if an (adaptive) test exists that distinguishes all pairs of\nincompatible states of an LTS, our algorithm will find one.

This\nregularization relaxes the wave-equation constraint to reconstruct wavefields\nthat match the data, hence mitigating the risk of cycle skipping. The\nsubsurface model parameters are then updated in a direction that reduces these\nconstraint violations. However, in the case of a rough initial model, the phase\nerrors in the reconstructed wavefields may trap the waveform inversion in a\nlocal minimum leading to inaccurate subsurface models. In this paper, in order\nto avoid matching such incorrect phase information during the early WRI\niterations, we design a new cost function based upon phase retrieval, namely a\nprocess which seeks to reconstruct a signal from the amplitude of linear\nmeasurements. This new formulation, called Wavefield Inversion with Phase\nRetrieval (WIPR), further improves the robustness of the parameter estimation\nsubproblem by a suitable phase correction. We implement the resulting WIPR\nproblem with an alternating-direction approach, which combines the\nMajorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm to linearise the phase-retrieval term\nand a variable splitting technique based upon the alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM).

To deal with these challenges,\nin this paper we propose to learn efficient deep object detectors through\nchannel pruning of convolutional layers. To this end, we enforce channel-level\nsparsity of convolutional layers by imposing L1 regularization on channel\nscaling factors and prune less informative feature channels to obtain \"slim\"\nobject detectors. Based on such approach, we present SlimYOLOv3 with fewer\ntrainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) in comparison of\noriginal YOLOv3 (Joseph Redmon et al., 2018) as a promising solution for\nreal-time object detection on UAVs.

Planets orbiting within the Habitable Zone of RDs are\nclose enough to be tidally locked. Some recent works have cast doubt on the\nability of planets orbiting RDs to support life. In contrast, it is shown that\ntemperatures suitable for liquid water and even for organic molecules may exist\non tidally locked planets of RDs for a wide range of atmospheres. We chart the\nsurface temperature distribution as a function of the irradiation, greenhouse\nfactor and heat circulation. The habitability boundaries and their dependence\non the atmospheric properties are derived. Extending our previous analyses of\ntidally locked planets, we find that tidally locked as well as synchronous (not\ncompletely locked) planets of RDs and K-type stars may support life, for a\nwider range of orbital distance and atmospheric conditions than previously\nthought. In particular, it is argued that life clement environments may be\npossible on tidally locked and synchronously orbiting planets of RDs and K-type\nstars, with conditions supporting Oxygenic Photosynthesis, which on Earth was a\nkey to Complex life. Different climate projections and the biological\nsignificance of tidal locking on putative complex life are reviewed. We show\nthat when the effect of continuous radiation is taken into account, the\nPhoto-synthetically Active Radiation (PAR) available on tidally locked planets,\neven of RDs, could produce a high Potential Plant Productivity, in analogy to\nmid-summer growth at high latitudes on Earth.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach of regulating DCNN convolutional\nkernels by a structured filter bank. Comparing with the existing regularization\nmethods, such as $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$ minimization of DCNN kernel weights and\nthe kernel orthogonality, which ignore sample correlations within a kernel, the\nuse of filter bank in regularization of DCNNs can mold the DCNN kernels to\ncommon spatial structures and features (e.g., edges or textures of various\norientations and frequencies) of natural images. On the other hand, unlike\ndirectly making DCNN kernels fixed filters, the filter bank regularization\nstill allows the freedom of optimizing DCNN weights via deep learning. This new\nDCNN design strategy aims to combine the best of two worlds: the inclusion of\nstructural image priors of traditional filter banks to improve the robustness\nand generality of DCNN solutions and the capability of modern deep learning to\nmodel complex non-linear functions hidden in training data. Experimental\nresults on object recognition tasks show that the proposed regularization\napproach guides DCNNs to faster convergence and better generalization than\nexisting regularization methods of weight decay and kernel orthogonality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 20:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 20:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

For the related tasks of\nimage classification and semantic segmentation, numerous CNN-based methods with\nrobust training behavior have been proposed. Hence, in order to overcome the\nnotorious instability and slow convergence of depth value regression during\ntraining, MultiDepth makes use of depth interval classification as an auxiliary\ntask. The auxiliary task can be disabled at test-time to predict continuous\ndepth values using the main regression branch more efficiently.

The elastic periodic structures have\neither the triangular or the honeycomb symmetry and give rise to a\ndouble-negative branch in the dispersion curves. By artificially folding the\ndoubly negative branch, a degenerate Dirac cone is achieved. Different\npolarization-dependent propagation along the same primary direction along the\nconstituent branches are presented. Moreover, divergent polarization-dependent\nphenomena along different primary directions along a given branch are also\nreported. By imposing two large space-inversion symmetry (SIS) breaking\nperturbations the topological phase transition is obtained. We show that the\nBerry curvature becomes strongly anisotropic when the wave vector gets away\nfrom the valleys. Further, we demonstrate the unidirectional transport of A0,\nS0, and SH0 Lamb waves at different domain walls in straight or Z-shape wave\nguides. In the large SIS breaking case, we show negligible reflection at the\nzigzag outlet of the straight wave guide and occurrence of weak inter-valley\nscattering at the bending corners of the Z-shape wave guide. For a larger\nstrength of SIS breaking, the edge states are gapped and strong reflection at\nthe zigzag outlet and bending corners is observed. The topological protection\ncannot be guaranteed any more in that case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 15:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

For example, the maximum likelihood estimator\nhas a bias that can result in a significant inferential loss. This problem is\ntypically magnified in high-dimensional settings where the number of variables\n$p$ is allowed to diverge with the sample size $n$. However, it is generally\ndifficult to establish whether an estimator is unbiased and therefore its\nasymptotic order is a common approach used (in low-dimensional settings) to\nquantify the magnitude of the bias. As an alternative, we introduce a new and\nstronger property, possibly for high-dimensional settings, called phase\ntransition unbiasedness. An estimator satisfying this property is unbiased for\nall $n$ greater than a finite sample size $n^\\ast$. Moreover, we propose a\nphase transition unbiased estimator built upon the idea of matching an initial\nestimator computed on the sample and on simulated data. It is not required for\nthis initial estimator to be consistent and thus it can be chosen for its\ncomputational efficiency and/or for other desirable properties such as\nrobustness. This estimator can be computed using a suitable simulation based\nalgorithm, namely the iterative bootstrap, which is shown to converge\nexponentially fast. In addition, we demonstrate the consistency and the\nlimiting distribution of this estimator in high-dimensional settings. Finally,\nas an illustration, we use our approach to develop new estimators for the\nlogistic regression model, with and without random effects, that also enjoy\nother properties such as robustness to data contamination and are also not\naffected by the problem of separability. In a simulation exercise, the\ntheoretical results are confirmed in settings where the sample size is\nrelatively small compared to the model dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 15:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 15:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

Sensorimotor theory suggests\nthat they represent functions, laws, describing how the information can be\ntransformed, or, in other words, they represent the statistics of sensorimotor\nchanges rather than sensory inputs themselves. The aim of our work is to\nsuggest a way for machine learning and sensorimotor theory to benefit from each\nother so as to pave the way toward new horizons in learning. We show in this\nstudy that a highly abstract notion, that of space, can be seen as a collection\nof laws of transformations of sensory information and that these laws could in\ntheory be learned by a naive agent. As an illustration we do a one-dimensional\nsimulation in which an agent extracts spatial knowledge in the form of\ninternalized (\"sensible\") rigid displacements. The agent uses them to encode\nits own displacements in a way which is isometrically related to external\nspace. Though the algorithm allowing acquisition of rigid displacements is\ndesigned \\emph{ad hoc}, we believe it can stimulate the development of\nunsupervised learning techniques leading to similar results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

Further optimization of Magneto-optical (MO) properties versus the\nmicrocavity position within the MOPC was investigated. An optimum multilayered\nconfiguration and composition was identified with a reduction in both erbium\nconcentration and total thickness compared to what was reported previously\nwithout compromising the target MO properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

The general concept lattice permits a\nfeasible construction that can be completed in a single scan of the formal\ncontext, though the conventional formal-concept lattice and rough-set lattice\ncan be regained from the general concept lattice. The logic implication\ndeducible from the general concept lattice takes the form of {\\mu}_1\n{\\rightarrow} {\\mu}_2 where {\\mu}_1,{\\mu}_2 {\\in} M^{\\ast} are composite\nattributes out of the concerned formal attributes M.

The emerging vehicular applications and the exponential growing data\nhave naturally led to the increased needs of communication, computation and\nstorage resources, and also to strict performance requirements on response time\nand network bandwidth. In order to deal with these challenges, Mobile Edge\nComputing (MEC) is regarded as a promising solution. MEC pushes powerful\ncomputational and storage capacities from the remote cloud to the edge of\nnetworks in close proximity of vehicular users, which enables low latency and\nreduced bandwidth consumption. Driven by the benefits of MEC, many efforts have\nbeen devoted to integrating vehicular networks into MEC, thereby forming a\nnovel paradigm named as Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC). In this paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive survey of state-of-art research on VEC. First of all,\nwe provide an overview of VEC, including the introduction, architecture, key\nenablers, advantages, challenges as well as several attractive application\nscenarios.

MI can improve\nInternet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management of\nlarge volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale\nIoT deployments. When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment\nmust account for the latency demands and network bandwidth requirements. To\nthis extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device aims to address\nsuch requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in\nthe IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of\nMI interoperability. Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the\napplication that exploits it, limiting the provisioning of that specific\nintelligence service to additional applications. The objective of this article\nis to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on\ndecoupling the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional\ndevice's stack and introducing an intelligence layer that provides services to\nthe overlying application layer. This paradigm aims to provide final users with\nmore control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting providers'\nincentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device.\nBased on the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects\nrelated to the intelligence distribution and its impact in the whole MI\necosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-26"}

Recently, a\nmathematical model of wholeness, together with its topological representation,\nhas been developed that is capable of addressing not only why a space is good,\nbut also how much goodness the space has. This paper develops a structural\nperspective on goodness of space - both large- and small-scale - in order to\nbridge two basic concepts of space and place through the very concept of\nwholeness. The wholeness provides a de facto recursive definition of goodness\nof space from a holistic and organic point of view.
