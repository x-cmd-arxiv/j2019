Recently it has been shown that in the quantum regime an\nadditional quantum irreversibility occurs that is linked to decoherence into\nthe energy basis. Here we employ quantum trajectories to construct\ndistributions for classical heat and quantum heat exchanges, and show that the\nheat footprint of quantum irreversibility differs markedly from the classical\ncase. We also quantify how quantum irreversibility reduces the amount of work\nthat can be extracted from a state with coherences. Our results show that\ndecoherence leads to both entropic and energetic footprints which both play an\nimportant role in the optimization of controlled quantum operations at low\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 16:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 12:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

However, empirical evidence of the merits of these\napproaches is lacking in the literature, and the derivation of informative\nprior distributions is required for these approaches to be effective.

We then argue\nthat this triangular array setting will pose substantially new challenges to\nthe verification of some dependence conditions. In particular, ``textbook\nresults\" could now be misleading, and hence are recommended to be used with\ncaution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 16:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

The results\nbased on local spin density approximation (LSDA) for the density functional\ntheory (DFT) suggest that the Co magnetic moment strongly depends on the\ndirections of the surrounding magnetic moments, which usually indicates the\nStoner-type mechanism of magnetism. This is consistent with the disordered\nlocal moment (DLM) picture of the paramagnetic state, where the magnetic moment\nof cobalt gets substantially suppressed. We argue that this is due to the lack\nof strong on-site electron correlations, which we take into account by\nemploying a combination of DFT and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Within\nLDA+DMFT, we find a substantial quasiparticle mass renormalization and a non\nFermi-liquid behaviour of Fe-$3d$ orbitals.

Generally, it has been\nrecognized that a transition from dosimetry based on planar images towards\nbased on fully-quantitative SPECT is beneficial in terms of increased accuracy.\nSPECT based dosimetry could not only be used for achieving accurate absorbed\ndose per-organ, but even for deriving dose values for individual voxels.\nHowever, a voxel-wise determination of TACs is problematic since several\nconfounding factors exist, such as e.g. poor count-statistics or registration\ninaccuracies. A particle filter (PF) is a class of methods which applies\nregularization based on a model of a state's evolution over time. We applied\nPFs for de-noising the TACs of 26 patients, who underwent Lu-177-DOTATOC or\n-PSMA therapy. The TACs were obtained from four serial SPECT(/CT) data. The\nmodel used in the PF was a mono-exponential decay. The time-integrated\nactivities (TIA) resulting from the PF were compared to the results of a\nmonoexponential fit of the individual voxels in several volumes of interest.\nOptimal values for noise of observations and noise of the model were 0.25 and\n0.5, respectively. The distribution of voxel-wise halflives resulting from the\nPFFit method were considerably closer to the organ average value and the number\nof implausibly long halflives was reduced. However, one has to admit that\nvoxel-wise fitting generally lead to considerable deviations from the\norgan-average TIA as obtained by conventional whole-organ evaluation.\nUnfortunately, we did not have ground-truth TIA of our patient data and proper\nground-truth could even be impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, there are strong\nindicators that Particle Filtering can be used for reducing voxel-wise TAC\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 17:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

In terms of the environmental role, we still do not\nhave a clear picture of the processes driving the transformation of galaxies.\nThe use of proxies for environment (e.g., host halo mass, distance to the N^th\nnearest neighbour, etc.), as opposed to the real physical conditions (e.g., hot\ngas density) may bear some responsibility for this. Here we propose a new\nmethod that directly links galaxies to their local environments, by using\nspatial cross-correlations of galaxy catalogues with maps from large-scale\nstructure surveys (e.g., thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich [tSZ] effect, diffuse X-ray\nemission, weak lensing of galaxies or the CMB). We focus here on the quenching\nof galaxies and its link to local hot gas properties. Maps of galaxy\noverdensity and quenched fraction excess are constructed from volume-limited\nSDSS catalogs, which are cross-correlated with tSZ effect and X-ray maps from\nPlanck and ROSAT, respectively. Strong signals out to Mpc scales are detected\nfor most cross-correlations and are compared to predictions from the EAGLE and\nBAHAMAS cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The simulations successfully\nreproduce many, but not all, of the observed power spectra, with an indication\nthat environmental quenching may be too efficient in the simulations. We\ndemonstrate that the cross-correlations are sensitive to both the internal\n(e.g., AGN and stellar feedback) and external processes (e.g., ram pressure\nstripping, harassment, strangulation, etc.) responsible for quenching. The\nmethods outlined in this paper can be adapted to other observables and, with\nupcoming surveys, will provide a stringent test of physical models for\nenvironmental transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 12:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The\nscreening is less efficient in underdense regions, which suggests that cosmic\nvoids can be a useful cosmological probe for constraining modified gravity\nmodels. In particular, weak lensing by voids has been proposed as a promising\ntest of such theories. Usually, voids are identified from galaxy distributions,\nmaking them biased tracers of the underlying matter field. An alternative\napproach is to study voids identified in weak lensing maps -- weak lensing\nvoids -- which have been shown to better correspond to true underdense regions.\nIn this paper, we study the ability of weak lensing voids to detect the\nsignatures of modified gravity. Focusing on the void abundance and weak lensing\nprofiles, we find that both statistics are sensitive probes of gravity. These\nare quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) with which an\nLSST-like survey will be able to distinguish between different gravity models.\nWe find that the tangential shear profiles of weak lensing voids are\nconsiderably better than galaxy voids at this, though voids have somewhat lower\nSNR than weak lensing peaks. The abundances of voids and peaks have\nrespectively $\\rm{SNR} = 50$ and $70$ for a popular class of modified gravity\nin an LSST-like survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 11:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

One of the major\nobstacles towards its exploitation is the strong degradation that some of its\nkey physical properties - such as the carrier mobility and the superconducting\ntransition temperature - undergo upon the introduction of disorder. This makes\nthe two-dimensional hole gas induced at its surface by electric field-effect\ndoping particularly interesting from both a fundamental and an applied\nperspective, since it strongly reduces the amount of extrinsic disorder with\nrespect to the standard boron substitution.

The analytics of streaming data usually relies on\nthe output of offline analytics on static or archived data. However, businesses\nand organizations like our industry partner Gnowit, strive to provide their\ncustomers with real time market information and continuously look for a unified\nanalytics framework that can integrate both streaming and offline analytics in\na seamless fashion to extract knowledge from large volumes of hybrid streaming\ndata. We present our study on designing a multilevel streaming text data\nanalytics framework by comparing leading edge scalable open-source,\ndistributed, and in-memory technologies. We demonstrate the functionality of\nthe framework for a use case of multilevel text analytics using deep learning\nfor language understanding and sentiment analysis including data indexing and\nquery processing. Our framework combines Spark streaming for real time text\nprocessing, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for higher\nlevel sentiment analysis, and other tools for SQL-based analytical processing\nto provide a scalable solution for multilevel streaming text analytics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 18:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

This manuscript presents a computationally tractable\nconvex inner approximation for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem that\ncharacterizes a feeders aggregate DERs hosting capacity and enables a realtime,\ngrid-aware dispatch of DERs for radial distribution networks. The inner\napproximation is derived by considering convex envelopes on the nonlinear terms\nin the AC power flow equations. The resulting convex formulation is then used\nto derive provable nodal injection limits, such that any combination of DER\ndispatches within their respective nodal limits is guaranteed to be AC\nadmissible. These nodal injection limits are then used to construct a realtime,\nopen-loop control policy for dispatching DERs at each location in the network\nto collectively deliver grid services.

For example, we consider a study\nthat investigates the benefit of interventions in young adulthood for\nameliorating the poorer mid-life psychosocial outcomes of adolescent\nself-harmers relative to their healthy peers. Two methodological challenges\narise. Firstly, mediation methods have hitherto mostly focused on the elusive\ntask of discovering pathways, rather than on the evaluation of mediator\ninterventions. Secondly, the complexity of such questions is invariably such\nthat there are no existing data on well-defined interventions (i.e. actual\ntreatments, programs, etc.) capturing the populations, outcomes and time-spans\nof interest. Instead, researchers must rely on exposure (non-intervention) data\nto address these questions, such as self-reported substance use and employment.\nWe address the resulting challenges by specifying a target trial addressing\nthree policy-relevant questions, regarding the impacts of hypothetical (rather\nthan actual) interventions that would shift the mediators' distributions\n(separately, jointly or sequentially) to user-specified distributions that can\nbe emulated with the observed data. We then define novel interventional effects\nthat map to this trial, emulating shifts by setting mediators to random draws\nfrom those distributions. We show that estimation using a g-computation method\nis possible under an expanded set of causal assumptions relative to inference\nwith well-defined interventions.

While previous work within this model of assembly has\nfocused on designing a specific board configuration for the assembly of a\nspecific given shape, we propose the problem of designing universal\nconfigurations that are capable of constructing a large class of shapes and\npatterns. In particular, for given integers $h,w$, we show that there exists a\nstrongly universal configuration (no excess particles) with $\\mathcal{O}(hw)$\n$1 \\times 1$ slidable particles that can be reconfigured to build any $h \\times\nw$ patterned rectangle. We then expand this result to show that there exists a\nweakly universal configuration that can build any $h \\times w$-bounded size\nconnected shape. Following these results, we go on to show the existence of a\nstrongly universal configuration which can assemble any shape within a\npreviously studied ``drop'' class, while using quadratically less space than\nprevious results.\n  Finally, we include a study of the complexity of motion planning in this\nmodel. We consider the problems of deciding if a board location can be occupied\nby any particle (occupancy problem), deciding if a specific particle may be\nrelocated to another position (relocation problem), and deciding if a given\nconfiguration of particles may be transformed into a second given configuration\n(reconfiguration problem). We show all of these problems to be PSPACE-complete\nwith the allowance of a single $2\\times 2$ polyomino in addition to $1\\times 1$\ntiles. We further show that relocation and occupancy remain PSPACE-complete\neven when the board geometry is a simple rectangle if domino polyominoes are\nincluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 20:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Interestingly, we find large\ndifferences between the magnifications of the four supernova images, even after\naccounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections: $\\Delta m_1 =\n-3.88^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, $\\Delta m_2 = -2.99^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, $\\Delta m_3 =\n-2.19^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ and $\\Delta m_4 = -2.40^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ mag, discrepant\nwith model predictions suggesting similar image brightnesses. A possible\nexplanation for the large differences is gravitational lensing by\nsubstructures, micro- or millilensing, in addition to the large scale lens\ncausing the image separations. We find that the inferred magnification is\ninsensitive to the assumptions about the dust properties in the host and lens\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 21:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Finally,\nto enable scalable query processing with high throughput, StarCloak makes\ncost-aware star selection decisions by considering query evaluation and network\ncommunication costs. We evaluate StarCloak on two real-world road network\ndatasets under various privacy and utility constraints.

Such a scheme, however, is not robust for rotational\nbehaviors in the sagittal plane.

Furthermore, we found a phenomenon\n\\textit{Smoothly Varying Weight Hypothesis} (SVWH) which is that the weights in\nadjacent convolution layers share strong similarity in shapes and values, i.e.,\nthe weights tend to vary smoothly along with the layers. Based on SVWH, we\npropose a second ILWP and quantization method which quantize the predicted\nresiduals between the weights in adjacent convolution layers. Since the\npredicted weight residuals tend to follow Laplace distributions with very low\nvariance, the weight quantization can more effectively be applied, thus\nproducing more zero weights and enhancing the weight compression ratio. In\naddition, we propose a new \\textit{inter-layer loss} for eliminating\nnon-texture bits, which enabled us to more effectively store only texture bits.\nThat is, the proposed loss regularizes the weights such that the collocated\nweights between the adjacent two layers have the same values.

In recent years, methods based on\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and\nDynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) outperformed all the traditional\nmethods because of their ability to capture complex representation of human\nlearning.

Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of\ndistances in a metric space $(X,d)$, where each point $x\\in X$ is assigned a\nsuccinct label, such that the distance between any two points $x,y \\in X$ can\nbe approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an\nembedding into $\\ell_\\infty$, where each point $x\\in X$ is assigned a vector\n$f(x)$ such that $\\|f(x)-f(y)\\|_\\infty$ is approximately $d(x,y)$. The\nperformance of a distance labeling or an $\\ell_\\infty$-embedding is measured\nvia its distortion and its label-size/dimension.\n  We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these\ntwo measures. Here, a priority order $\\pi=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ of the point set $X$\nis given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a\ndistance labeling has prioritized label-size $\\alpha(.)$ if every $x_j$ has\nlabel size at most $\\alpha(j)$. Similarly, an embedding $f: X \\to \\ell_\\infty$\nhas prioritized dimension $\\alpha(.)$ if $f(x_j)$ is non-zero only in the first\n$\\alpha(j)$ coordinates. In addition, we compare these their prioritized\nmeasures to their classical (worst-case) versions.\n  We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly\ndiverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have\nvery similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge\ndisparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict\nseparation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally,\nwhen comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the\nworst-case bound for label size often ``translates'' to a prioritized one, but\nalso a surprising exception to this rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 06:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

However, under the strict requirement on the resource cost, it is\nquite challenging to achieve comparable performance with the teacher model,\nessentially due to the drastically-reduced expressiveness ability of the\ncompact student model. Inspired by the nature of the expressiveness ability in\nNeural Networks, we propose to use multi-segment activation, which can\nsignificantly improve the expressiveness ability with very little cost, in the\ncompact student model.

We\ninvestigate here the significance of bar quenching in the global quenching of\nstar formation in the barred galaxies and their transformation to passive\ngalaxies in the local Universe. We do this by measuring the offset of quenched\nbarred galaxies from star-forming main sequence galaxies in the star formation\nrate-stellar mass plane and comparing it with the length of the bar, which is\nconsidered as a proxy of bar quenching. We constructed the star formation\nrate-stellar mass plane of 2885 local Universe face-on strong barred disk\ngalaxies ($z<0.06$) identified by Galaxy Zoo. The barred disk galaxies studied\nhere fall on the star formation main sequence relation with a significant\nscatter for galaxies above stellar mass 10$^{10.2}$ M$\\odot$. We found that\n34.97 $\\%$ galaxies are within the intrinsic scatter (0.3 dex) of the main\nsequence relation, with a starburst population of 10.78 $\\%$ (above the 0.3\ndex) and a quenched population of 54.25 $\\%$ (below the -0.3 dex) of the total\nbarred disk galaxies in our sample.

We found that the offset of the quenched barred\ngalaxies from the main sequence relation is not dependent on the length of the\nstellar bar. This implies that the bar quenching may not contribute\nsignificantly to the global quenching of star formation in barred galaxies.\nHowever, this observed result could also be due to other factors such as the\ndissolution of bars over time after star formation quenching, the effect of\nother quenching processes acting simultaneously, and/or the effects of\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 09:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Its many applications have\nattracted tremendous interest in recent years. However, many practical\napplications require pose estimation for human crowds, which still is a rarely\naddressed problem. In this work, we explore methods to optimize pose estimation\nfor human crowds, focusing on challenges introduced with dense crowds, such as\nocclusions, people in close proximity to each other, and partial visibility of\npeople. In order to address these challenges, we evaluate three aspects of a\npose detection approach: i) a data augmentation method to introduce robustness\nto occlusions, ii) the explicit detection of occluded body parts, and iii) the\nuse of the synthetic generated datasets. The first approach to improve the\naccuracy in crowded scenarios is to generate occlusions at training time using\nperson and object cutouts from the object recognition dataset COCO (Common\nObjects in Context). Furthermore, the synthetically generated dataset JTA\n(Joint Track Auto) is evaluated for the use in real-world crowd applications.\nIn order to overcome the transfer gap of JTA originating from a low pose\nvariety and less dense crowds, an extension dataset is created to ease the use\nfor real-world applications. Additionally, the occlusion flags provided with\nJTA are utilized to train a model, which explicitly distinguishes between\noccluded and visible body parts in two distinct branches. The combination of\nthe proposed additions to the baseline method help to improve the overall\naccuracy by 4.7% AP and thereby provide comparable results to current\nstate-of-the-art approaches on the respective dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 09:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The discrete symmetries are\ndiscrete Heisenberg groups, with two $\\mathbf{Z}_N$ generators $A$, $B$ with\ncommutation $AB=CBA$, with $C$ a central element. This fully generalizes\nearlier observations in particular orbifolds of $\\mathbf{C}^3$, the conifold\nand $Y_{p,q}$. The solution for any orbifold of a given parent theory follows\nfrom a universal structure in the infinite dimer in $\\mathbf{R}^2$ giving the\ncovering space of the unit cell of the parent theory before orbifolding. The\ngenerator $A$ is realized as a shift in the dimer diagram, associated to the\norbifold quantum symmetry; the action of $B$ is determined by equations\ndescribing a 1-form in the dimer graph in the unit cell of the parent theory\nwith twisted boundary conditions; finally, $C$ is an element of the (mesonic\nand baryonic) non-anomalous U$(1)$ symmetries, determined by geometric\nidentities involving the elements of the dimer graph of the parent theory.\nThese discrete global symmetries of the quiver gauge theories are\nholographically dual to discrete gauge symmetries from torsion cycles in the\nhorizon, as we also briefly discuss.

However, we learn from quantum theory that it is\ngenerally impossible to extract information without disturbing the state of the\nsystem or its correlations with other systems. In this paper we address the\nissue of the interplay between information and disturbance for a general\noperational probabilistic theory. The traditional notion of disturbance\nconsiders the fate of the system state after the measurement. However, the fact\nthat the system state is left untouched ensures that also correlations are\npreserved only in the presence of local discriminability. Here we provide the\ndefinition of disturbance that is appropriate for a general theory. Moreover,\nsince in a theory without causality information can be gathered also on the\neffect, we generalise the notion of no-information test. We then prove an\nequivalent condition for no-information without disturbance-atomicity of the\nidentity-namely the impossibility of achieving the trivial evolution-the\nidentity-as the coarse-graining of a set of non trivial ones. We prove a\ngeneral theorem showing that information that can be retrieved without\ndisturbance corresponds to perfectly repeatable and discriminating tests. Based\non this, we prove a structure theorem for operational probabilistic theories,\nshowing that the set of states of any system decomposes as a direct sum of\nperfectly discriminable sets, and such decomposition is preserved under system\ncomposition. As a consequence, a theory is such that any information can be\nextracted without disturbance only if all its systems are classical.

The non-adiabatic terms were allowed to be\narbitrarily large, corresponding to the observed values. The thermal\nconductivity was taken in its classical form, and a power-law dependence of the\nheating function on the density and temperature was assumed.

Optical microscopy, Raman, and electron spin resonance\nspectroscopy attest that the prepared samples are highly and homogeneously\nintercalated to a level approaching Stage-I intercalation compounds. The method\nand the synthesis route may serve as a starting point for the various forms of\nalkali atom intercalated carbon compounds (including carbon nanotubes and\ngraphene), which could be exploited in energy storage and further chemical\nmodifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

These heuristics complement\nprevious work by being inspired in the characteristics of the addition, Naive\nBayes, and Nearest Centroid functions and applying them only when the function\nis used to create an offspring. These heuristics use different similarity\nmeasures among the parents to decide which of them is more appropriate given a\nfunction.

Except for the Milky Way, not much is known about the transport\nof cosmic rays in galaxies. In this Letter, we present low-frequency\nobservations of the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4565 using the\nLOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). With our deep 144-MHz observations, we obtain a\nclean estimate of the emission originating from old cosmic-ray electrons (CRe),\nwhich is almost free from contamination by thermal emission. We measured\nvertical profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission that we fitted\nwith Gaussian and exponential functions. The different profile shapes\ncorrespond to 1D cosmic-ray transport models of pure diffusion and advection,\nrespectively. We detect a warp in the radio continuum that is reminiscent of\nthe previously known HI warp. Because the warp is not seen at GHz-frequencies\nin the radio continuum, its minimum age must be about 100 Myr. The warp also\nexplains the slight flaring of the thick radio disc that can otherwise be well\ndescribed by a Gaussian profile with an FWHM of 65 arcsec (3.7 kpc). The\ndiffusive radio halo together with the extra-planar X-ray emission may be\nremnants of enhanced star-forming activity in the past where the galaxy had a\ngalactic wind, as GHz-observations indicate only a weak outflow in the last 40\nMyr. NGC 4565 could be in transition from an outflow- to an inflow-dominated\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

A node begins the process by sending a message to all its\nneighbours and the neighbours, in the next round forward the message to all the\nneighbours they did not receive the message from and so on. We assume that the\nnodes do not keep a record of the flooding event. We call this amnesiac\nflooding (AF). Since the node forgets, if the message is received again in\nsubsequent rounds, it will be forwarded again raising the possibility that the\nmessage may be circulated infinitely even on a finite graph. As far as we know,\nthe question of termination for such a flooding process has not been settled -\nrather, non-termination is implicitly assumed.\n  In this paper, we show that synchronous AF always terminates on any arbitrary\nfinite graph and derive exact termination times which differ sharply in\nbipartite and non-bipartite graphs. Let $G$ be a finite connected graph. We\nshow that synchronous AF from a single source node terminates on $G$ in $e$\nrounds, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the source node, if and only if $G$ is\nbipartite. For non-bipartite $G$, synchronous AF from a single source\nterminates in $j$ rounds where $e < j \\leq e+d+1$ and $d$ is the diameter of\n$G$. This limits termination time to at most $d$ and at most $2d + 1$ for\nbipartite and non-bipartite graphs respectively. If communication/broadcast to\nall nodes is the motivation, our results show that AF is asymptotically time\noptimal and obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning\nstructures like spanning trees. The clear separation in the termination times\nof bipartite and non-bipartite graphs also suggests mechanisms for distributed\ndiscovery of the topology/distances in arbitrary graphs.\n  For comparison, we show that, in asynchronous networks, an adaptive adversary\ncan force AF to be non-terminating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

These networks can be understood as layers of a larger multiplex\ntransport network. Because most cities are car-centric, the most developed\nlayer is typically the street layer, while other layers can be highly\ndisconnected. To make urban transport sustainable, cities are increasingly\ninvesting to develop their bicycle networks. However, given the usually patchy\nnature of the bicycle network layer, it is yet unclear how to extend it\ncomprehensively and effectively given a limited budget. Here we develop\ndata-driven, algorithmic network growth strategies and apply them to cities\naround the world, showing that small but focused investments allow to\nsignificantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle\nnetworks. We motivate the development of our algorithms with a network\ncomponent analysis and with multimodal urban fingerprints that reveal different\nclasses of cities depending on the connectedness between different network\nlayers. We introduce two greedy algorithms to add the most critical missing\nlinks in the bicycle layer: The first algorithm connects the two largest\nconnected components, the second algorithm connects the largest with the\nclosest component. We show that these algorithms outmatch both a random\napproach and a baseline minimum investment strategy that connects the closest\ncomponents ignoring size. Our computational approach outlines novel pathways\nfrom car-centric towards sustainable cities by taking advantage of urban data\navailable on a city-wide scale. It is a first step towards a quantitative\nconsolidation of bicycle infrastructure development that can become valuable\nfor urban planners and stakeholders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In the method,\nwe have to calculate a stabilizing periodic orbit embedded in its chaotic\nattractor. Thus, we cannot use this method in the case where a precise\nmathematical model of the chaotic system cannot be identified. In this case,\nthe delayed feedback control proposed by Pyragas is useful. However, even in\nthe delayed feedback control, we need the mathematical model to determine a\nfeedback gain that stabilizes the periodic orbit. To overcome this problem, we\npropose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to the design of a\ncontroller for the chaotic system. In recent years, model-free reinforcement\nlearning algorithms with deep neural networks have been paid much attention to.\nThose algorithms make it possible to control complex systems. However, it is\nknown that model-free reinforcement learning algorithms are not efficient\nbecause learners must explore their control policies over the entire state\nspace.

In the proposed method, the controller efficiently explores its\ncontrol policy only in the region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 09:14:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 02:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 13:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

While the mechanisms regulating CTC homing in specific tissues are yet\nto be elucidated, it is well documented that CTCs possess different size,\nbiological properties and deformability. A computational model is presented to\npredict the vascular transport and adhesion of CTCs in whole blood. A\nLattice-Boltzmann method, which is employed to solve the Navier-Stokes equation\nfor the plasma flow, is coupled with an Immersed Boundary Method. The vascular\ndynamics of a CTC is assessed in large and small microcapillaries. The CTC\nshear modulus k ctc is varied returning CTCs that are stiffer, softer and\nequally deformable as compared to RBCs. In large microcapillaries, soft CTCs\nbehave similarly to RBCs and move away from the vessel walls; whereas rigid\nCTCs are pushed laterally by the fast moving RBCs and interact with the vessel\nwalls. Three adhesion behaviors are observed, firm adhesion, rolling and\ncrawling over the vessel walls, depending on the CTC stiffness. On the\ncontrary, in small microcapillaries, rigid CTCs are pushed downstream by a\ncompact train of RBCs and cannot establish any firm interaction with the vessel\nwalls; whereas soft CTCs are squeezed between the vessel wall and the RBC train\nand rapidly establish firm adhesion. These findings document the relevance of\ncell deformability in CTC vascular adhesion and provide insights on the\nmechanisms regulating metastasis formation in different vascular districts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 13:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

During the epitaxial growth of AlInN layer, an AlInN shell is\nspontaneously formed, resulted in the reduced nonradiative recombination on\nnanowire surface. The AlInN nanowires exhibit high internal quantum efficiency\nof ~ 52% at room temperature for emission at 295nm. The peak emission\nwavelength can be varied from 290 nm to 355 nm by changing the growth\ncondition. Moreover, significantly strong transverse magnetic (TM) polarized\nemission is recorded which is ~ 4 times stronger compared to the transverse\nelectric (TE) polarized light at 295 nm.

We employ the shooting method for the numerical calculations in\norder to obtain the ratio of the critical temperature $T_c$ over $\\rho^\n{1/(d-2)}$. We observe that by increasing the values of the mass and the\nnonlinear parameters the critical temperature decreases and thus the\ncondensation becomes harder to form. In addition, the stronger Gauss-Bonnet\nparameter $\\alpha$ hinders the superconducting phase in Gauss-Bonnet gravity.\nFurthermore, we calculate the electrical conductivity based on the holographic\nsetup. The real and imaginary parts are related to each other by Kramers-Kronig\nrelation which indicates a delta function and pole in low frequency regime,\nrespectively. However, at enough large frequencies the trend of real part can\nbe interpreted by $Re[\\sigma] = \\omega^{(d-4)}$. Moreover, in holographic model\nthe ratio $\\omega_g/T_c$ is always much larger than the BCS value $3.5$ due to\nthe strong coupling of holographic superconductors. In both gravity kinds,\ndecreasing the temperature or increasing the effect of nonlinearity shifts the\ngap frequency toward larger values. Besides, the gap frequency is occurred at\nlarger values by enlarging the Gauss-Bonnet parameter. In general, the behavior\nof conductivity depends on the choice of the mass, the nonlinear and the\nGauss-Bonnet parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 10:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}
