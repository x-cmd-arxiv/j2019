We use millimetric\novalbumin-alginate capsules which we manufacture and characterise independently\nof the flow experiment. Centred capsules travel at constant velocity down the\nstraight channel leading to the T-junction where they decelerate and expand in\nthe spanwise direction before turning into one of the two identical daughter\nchannels. There, non-inertial lift forces act to re-centre them and relax their\nshape until they reach a steady state of propagation. We find that the dynamics\nof fixed-size capsules within our channel geometry are governed by a capillary\nnumber Ca defined as the ratio of viscous shear forces to elastic restoring\nforces. We quantify the elastic forces by statically compressing the capsule to\n50% of its initial diameter between parallel plates rather than by the Young's\nmodulus of the encapsulating membrane, in order to account for different\nmembrane thickness, pre-inflation and non-linear elastic deformation. We show\nthat the maximum extension in the T-junction of capsules of different stiffness\ncollapses onto a master curve in Ca. Thus, it provides a sensitive measure of\nthe relative stiffness of capsules at constant flow rate, particularly for\nsofter capsules. We also find that the T-junction can sort fixed-size capsules\naccording to their stiffness because the position in the T-junction from which\ncapsules are entrained into the daughter channel depends uniquely on Ca. We\ndemonstrate that a T-junction can be used as a sorting device by enhancing this\ninitial capsule separation through a diffuser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 22:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Among these tasks, garment folding is one of them that is\nstill far from being achieved mainly due to the large number of possible\nconfigurations that a crumpled piece of clothing may exhibit. Research has been\ndone on either estimating the pose of the garment as a whole or detecting the\nlandmarks for grasping separately. However, such works constrain the capability\nof the robots to perceive the states of the garment by limiting the\nrepresentations for one single task. In this paper, we propose a novel\nend-to-end deep learning model named GarmNet that is able to simultaneously\nlocalize the garment and detect landmarks for grasping. The localization of the\ngarment represents the global information for recognising the category of the\ngarment, whereas the detection of landmarks can facilitate subsequent grasping\nactions. We train and evaluate our proposed GarmNet model using the CloPeMa\nGarment dataset that contains 3,330 images of different garment types in\ndifferent poses. The experiments show that the inclusion of landmark detection\n(GarmNet-B) can largely improve the garment localization, with an error rate of\n24.7% lower.

Both\napproaches are too restrictive in practice, hence we proceed differently by\npresenting an algorithm for checking subtyping which is sound, but not complete\n(in some cases it terminates without returning a decisive verdict). The\nalgorithm is based on a tree representation of the coinductive definition of\nasynchronous subtyping; this tree could be infinite, and the algorithm checks\nfor the presence of finite witnesses of infinite successful subtrees.\nFurthermore, we provide a tool that implements our algorithm. We use this tool\nto test our algorithm on many examples that cannot be managed with the previous\napproaches, and to provide an empirical evaluation of the time and space cost\nof the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 17:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 05:25:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 09:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 09:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 08:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

This results in replacing image\nregistration by a conditional segmentation algorithm, which can build on\ntypical image segmentation networks and their widely-adopted training\nstrategies. Using the registration of 3D MRI and ultrasound images of the\nprostate as an example to demonstrate this new approach, we report a median\ntarget registration error (TRE) of 2.1 mm between the ground-truth ROIs defined\non intraoperative ultrasound images and those propagated from the preoperative\nMR images. Significantly lower (>34%) TREs were obtained using the proposed\nconditional segmentation compared with those obtained from a\npreviously-proposed spatial-transformation-predicting registration network\ntrained with the same multiple ROI labels for individual image pairs. We\nconclude this work by using a quantitative bias-variance analysis to provide\none explanation of the observed improvement in registration accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 19:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Each robot forms a dynamic belief of others' types based\non intrinsic or extrinsic information. Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE)\nis a natural solution concept for dynamic games of incomplete information.

There are several IPS methods such as AOA, TOA, TDOA, which use\ntrilateration for indoor location estimation but are generally based on\nline-of-sight. Other methods rely on classification such as fingerprinting\nwhich uses WLAN indoor signals. This paper re-examines the classical WLAN\nfingerprinting accuracy which uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements\nby introducing channel estimates for improvements in the classification of\nindoor locations. The purpose of this paper is to improve existing\nclassification algorithms used in fingerprinting by introducing channel\nestimates when there are a low number of APs available. The channel impulse\nresponse, or in this case the channel estimation from the receiver, should\ncharacterize a complex indoor area which usually has multipath, thus providing\na unique signature for each location which proves useful for better pattern\nrecognition. In this experiment, channel estimates are extracted from a\nSoftware-Defined Radio (SDR) environment, thus exploiting the benefits of SDR\nfrom a NI-USRP model and LabVIEW software. Measurements are taken from a known\nbuilding, and several scenarios with one and two access points (APs) are used\nin this experiment. Also, three granularities in distance between locations are\nanalyzed. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the algorithm for pattern\nrecognition of different locations based on the samples taken from RSS and\nchannel estimation coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 21:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Repositioning\ndemocratic values of citizens' choices in these complex ecosystems has turned\nout to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and\nopportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper\nintroduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively\nengaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public\nurban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the\nAncient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens\nassemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters.\nThe core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving\nwitness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence\nand testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the\nchallenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus\nto empower citizens' trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS\nlocalization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and\ncrowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how\nreal-time collective measurements over citizens' choices can be made in a fully\ndecentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by\ndeploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of\ntransport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated\nusing official accident data from public authorities, which are compared\nagainst wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus,\nself-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented\ndemocracy paradigm is outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 23:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 19:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 22:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 22:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

The principal control\nmechanism of such languages is the general lifting of functions that operate on\narrays of rank (or dimension) $r$ to operate on arrays of any higher rank $r' >\nr$. We present a core, functional language, Remora, that captures this\nmechanism, and develop both a formal, dynamic semantics for the language, and\nan accompanying static, rank-polymorphic type system for the language.\nCritically, the static semantics captures the shape-based lifting mechanism of\nthe language. We establish the usual progress and preservation properties for\nthe type system, showing that it is sound, which means that \"array shape\"\nerrors cannot occur at run time in a well-typed program. Our type system uses\ndependent types, including an existential type abstraction which permits\nprograms to operate on arrays whose shape or rank is computed dynamically;\nhowever, it is restricted enough to permit static type checking.\n  The rank-polymorphic computational paradigm is unusual in that the types of\narguments affect the dynamic execution of the program -- they are what drive\nthe rank-polymorphic distribution of a function across arrays of higher rank.\nTo highlight this property, we additionally present a dynamic semantics for a\npartially erased variant of the fully-typed language and show that a\ncomputation performed with a fully-typed term stays in lock step with the\ncomputation performed with its partially erased term. The residual types thus\nprecisely characterise the type information that is needed by the dynamic\nsemantics, a property useful for the (eventual) construction of efficient\ncompilers for rank-polymorphic languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 01:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Results:\nTwenty-three topics were coded and then grouped into three overarching themes\nfrom the sex discrimination and sexual harassment literature. The Sex\nDiscrimination theme included experiences in which women were treated\nunfavorably due to their sex, such as being passed over for promotion, denied\nopportunities, paid less than men, and ignored or talked over in meetings. The\nSex Discrimination and Gender harassment theme included stories about sex\ndiscrimination and gender harassment, such as sexist hostility behaviors\nranging from insults and jokes invoking misogynistic stereotypes to bullying\nbehavior.

Two\nfinite size spheres with specific gravities of 1.003 (P1) and 1.050 (P2) and\ndiameters of 60 and 120 wall units were released individually from rest on a\nsmooth wall. The spheres were marked with dots all over the surface to monitor\ntheir translation and rotation via high-speed stereoscopic imaging. The spheres\naccelerated strongly after release over streamwise distances of one boundary\nlayer thickness before approaching an approximate terminal velocity. Initially,\nsphere P1, which had Reynolds numbers $Re_p$ of 800 and 1900, always lifts off\nfrom the wall. Similar behavior was observed occasionally for sphere P2 with\ninitial $Re_p$ of 1900. The spheres that lifted off reached an initial peak in\nheight before descending towards the wall. The sphere trajectories exhibited\nmultiple behaviors including saltation, resuspension and sliding motion with\nsmall random bouncing depending on both $Re_\\tau$ and specific gravity. The\nlighter sphere at $Re_\\tau=1300$, which remained suspended above the wall\nduring most of its trajectory, propagated with the fastest streamwise velocity.\nBy contrast, the denser sphere at $Re_\\tau=700$, which mostly slid along the\nwall, propagated with the slowest streamwise velocity. After the spheres\napproached an approximate terminal velocity, many experienced additional\nlift-off events that were hypothesized to be driven by hairpins or coherent\nflow structures. Spheres were observed to rotate about all three coordinate\naxes. While the mean shear may induce a rotation about the spanwise axis,\nnear-wall coherent structures and the sphere's wake might drive the streamwise\nand wall-normal rotations. In all cases where the sphere propagates along the\nwall, sliding motion, rather than forward rolling motion, is dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 03:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

In the case of orthogonal Tx-Rx beam pairs, a power-based estimator\nis employed to track the time-varying AoA and AoD of the channel, and the\nresulting training beam pair sequence design problem is formulated as an\ninteger nonlinear programming (I-NLP) problem.

In this paper, we propose an adversarial\nprocess using cosine similarity, whereas conventional adversarial processes are\nbased on inverted categorical cross entropy (CCE). When used for training an\nidentification model, the adversarial process induces the competition of two\ndiscriminative models; one for a primary task such as speaker identification or\nimage recognition, the other one for a subsidiary task such as channel\nidentification or domain identification. In particular, the adversarial process\ndegrades the performance of the subsidiary model by eliminating the subsidiary\ninformation in the input which, in assumption, may degrade the performance of\nthe primary model. The conventional adversarial processes maximize the CCE of\nthe subsidiary model to degrade the performance. We have studied a framework\nfor training robust discriminative models by eliminating channel or domain\ninformation (subsidiary information) by applying such an adversarial process.\nHowever, we found through experiments that using the process of maximizing the\nCCE does not guarantee the performance degradation of the subsidiary model.

The experiments on\nspeaker identification and image recognition show that we found features that\nmake the outputs of the subsidiary models independent of the input, and the\nperformances of the primary models are improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 04:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Many recent works have relied on partially labeled\ncross-graph node correspondences, i.e., anchor links. However, due to the\nprivacy and security issue, the manual labeling of anchor links for diverse\nscenarios may be prohibitive. Aligning two graphs without any anchor links is a\ncrucial and challenging task. In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised\nAdversarial Graph Alignment (UAGA) framework to learn a cross-graph alignment\nbetween two embedding spaces of different graphs in a fully unsupervised\nfashion (\\emph{i.e.,} no existing anchor links and no users' personal profile\nor attribute information is available). The proposed framework learns the\nembedding spaces of each graph, and then attempts to align the two spaces via\nadversarial training, followed by a refinement procedure. We further extend our\nUAGA method to incremental UAGA (iUAGA) that iteratively reveals the unobserved\nuser links based on the pseudo anchor links. This can be used to further\nimprove both the embedding quality and the alignment accuracy. Moreover, the\nproposed methods will benefit some real-world applications, \\emph{e.g.,} link\nprediction in social networks. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches UAGA and iUAGA for\nunsupervised graph alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 04:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

In this problem, a\nuser wants to privately download one or more messages belonging to a database\nwith copies stored on a single or multiple remote servers. In the single server\nscenario, the user must have prior side information, i.e., a subset of messages\nunknown to the server, to be able to privately retrieve the required messages\nin an efficient way.\n  In the last decade, there has also been a significant interest in Locally\nRecoverable Codes (LRC), a class of storage codes in which each symbol can be\nrecovered from a limited number of other symbols. More recently, there is an\ninterest in 'cooperative' locally recoverable codes, i.e., codes in which\nmultiple symbols can be recovered from a small set of other code symbols.\n  In this paper, we establish a relationship between coding schemes for the\nsingle-server PIR problem and LRCs. In particular, we show the following\nresults: (i) PIR schemes designed for retrieving a single message are\nequivalent to classical LRCs; and (ii) PIR schemes for retrieving multiple\nmessages are equivalent to cooperative LRCs. These equivalence results allow us\nto recover upper bounds on the download rate for PIR-SI schemes, and to obtain\na novel rate upper bound on cooperative LRCs.

The impact of the ionosphere on ULW radio\nemission depends on the Solar cycle activities and varies with time. In\naddition, the ULW spectrum region is densely populated by intensive artificial\nradio frequency interference (RFI). An obvious solution of these problems is to\nplace an ULW radio telescope in space. However, this solution is expensive and\nposes non-negligible technological challenges. An alternative approach is\ntriggered by recent studies showing that the period of post 2020 will be most\nsuitable for exploratory ground-based ULW radio observations due to the\nexpected 'calm' state of the ionosphere; the ionospheric cutoff-frequency could\nbe well below 10 MHz, even in the day time.

The idea behind a\ncapsule is inspired by a cortical minicolumn in the brain, whereby a vertically\norganised group of around 100 neurons receive common inputs, have common\noutputs, are interconnected, and may well constitute a fundamental computation\nunit of the cerebral cortex. However, Hinton's paper on \"Matrix Capsule with EM\nRouting'\" was unfortunately not accompanied by a release of source code, which\nleft interested researchers attempting to implement the architecture and\nreproduce the benchmarks on their own. This has certainly slowed the progress\nof research building on this work. While writing our own implementation, we\nnoticed several common mistakes in other open source implementations that we\ncame across. In this paper we share some of these learnings, specifically\nfocusing on three implementation pitfalls and how to avoid them: (1) parent\ncapsules with only one child; (2) normalising the amount of data assigned to\nparent capsules; (3) parent capsules at different positions compete for child\ncapsules. While our implementation is a considerable improvement over currently\navailable implementations, it still falls slightly short of the performance\nreported by Hinton et al. (2018).

Recently, many deep learning based solutions have been\nproposed by exploiting reviews for recommendation. The attention mechanism is\nmainly adopted in these works to identify words or aspects that are important\nfor rating prediction. However, it is still hard to understand whether a user\nlikes or dislikes an aspect of an item according to what viewpoint the user\nholds and to what extent, without examining the review details.

To this end, in this paper,\nwe propose a capsule network based model for rating prediction with user\nreviews, named CARP.

In case of\nclinical scans, with lower resolution and sometimes substantial motion\nartifacts, registration can produce poor results. Visual assessment of\nregistration quality in large clinical datasets is inefficient. In this work,\nwe propose to automatically assess the quality of registration to an atlas in\nclinical FLAIR MRI scans of the brain. The method consists of automatically\nsegmenting the ventricles of a given scan using a neural network, and comparing\nthe segmentation to the atlas' ventricles propagated to image space. We used\nthe proposed method to improve clinical image registration to a general atlas\nby computing multiple registrations and then selecting the registration that\nyielded the highest ventricle overlap. Methods were evaluated in a single-site\ndataset of more than 1000 scans, as well as a multi-center dataset comprising\n142 clinical scans from 12 sites. The automated ventricle segmentation reached\na Dice coefficient with manual annotations of 0.89 in the single-site dataset,\nand 0.83 in the multi-center dataset. Registration via age-specific atlases\ncould improve ventricle overlap compared to a direct registration to the\ngeneral atlas (Dice similarity coefficient increase up to 0.15). Experiments\nalso showed that selecting scans with the registration quality assessment\nmethod could improve the quality of average maps of white matter hyperintensity\nburden, instead of using all scans for the computation of the white matter\nhyperintensity map. In this work, we demonstrated the utility of an automated\ntool for assessing image registration quality in clinical scans.

Similarly to state machine replication (SMR),\nCreek totally-orders all operations, but does so using two different broadcast\nmechanisms: a timestamp-based one and our novel conditional atomic broadcast\n(CAB). The former is used to establish a tentative order of all operations for\nspeculative execution, and it can tolerate network partitions. On the other\nhand, CAB is only used to ensure linearizable execution of the strongly\nconsistent operations, whenever distributed consensus can be solved. The\nexecution of strongly consistent operations also stabilizes the execution order\nof the causally related weakly consistent operations. Creek uses multiversion\nconcurrency control to efficiently handle operations' rollbacks and\nreexecutions resulting from the mismatch between the tentative and the final\nexecution orders. In the TPC-C benchmark, Creek offers up to 2.5 times lower\nlatency in returning client responses compared to the state-of-the-art\nspeculative SMR scheme, while maintaining high accuracy of the speculative\nexecution (92-100%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 13:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 16:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

In the literature IAs have\nbeen detected up to $\\sim 100~h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ using the gravitational\nshear-intrinsic ellipticity correlation and the alignment correlation function.\nIn this paper we introduce the corresponding various velocity statistics: the\n(density-weighted) velocity-intrinsic ellipticity correlation as well as the\nalignment pairwise infall momentum, momentum correlation function, and\ndensity-weighted pairwise velocity dispersion. We derive theoretical\nexpressions for these velocity alignment statistics for the first time based on\nthe assumption that the density fluctuation is a Gaussian random field. Using\nlarge-volume, high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we measure the alignment\nstatistics of density and velocity fields. The behaviors of IAs in the velocity\nstatistics are similar to those in the density statistics, except that the halo\norientations are aligned with the velocity field up to scales larger than those\nwith the density field, $r\\gg 100~h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$, because of a factor of the\nwave number in the linear relation between the density and velocity fields in\nFourier space, $v\\propto \\delta/k$.

Here we examine whether high heat\nfluxes near the mid-ocean ridge melts the HP ice and thereby removes\natmospheric ${\\rm CO_2}$. We develop integrated climate models of an Earth-size\nocean planet with plate tectonics for different ocean masses, which include the\neffects of HP ice melting, seafloor weathering, and the carbonate-silicate\ngeochemical carbon cycle. We find that the heat flux near the mid-ocean ridge\nis high enough to melt the ice, enabling seafloor weathering. In contrast to\nthe previous theoretical prediction, we show that climates of terrestrial\nplanets with massive oceans lapse into extremely cold ones (or snowball states)\nwith CO$_2$-poor atmospheres. Such extremely cold climates are achieved mainly\nbecause the HP ice melting fixes seafloor temperature at the melting\ntemperature, thereby keeping a high weathering flux regardless of surface\ntemperature. We estimate that ocean planets with oceans several tens of the\nEarth's ocean mass no longer maintain temperate climates.

The\nhigher dimension of inherent information in the appearance model compared to\nthe geometric model is problematic in many ways. However, due to the recent\nsuccess of deep-learning-based methods, handling of high-dimensional appearance\ninformation becomes feasible. Among many deep neural networks, Siamese network\nwith triplet loss has been widely adopted as an effective appearance feature\nextractor. Since the Siamese network can extract the features of each input\nindependently, one can update and maintain target-specific features. However,\nit is not suitable for multi-target settings that require comparison with other\ninputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel track appearance model based\non the joint-inference network. The proposed method enables a comparison of two\ninputs to be used for adaptive appearance modeling and contributes to the\ndisambiguation of target-observation matching and to the consolidation of\nidentity consistency. Diverse experimental results support the effectiveness of\nour method. Our work was recognized as the 3rd-best tracker in BMTT\nMOTChallenge 2019, held at CVPR2019.

A variety of recent works have been\nproposed to generalize neural networks to graphs, either from a spectral graph\ntheory or a spatial perspective.

At the same time,\nthe pooling operator also plays an important role in distilling multiscale and\nhierarchical representations but it has been mostly overlooked so far. In this\npaper, we propose a parameter-free pooling operator, called iPool, that permits\nto retain the most informative features in arbitrary graphs. With the argument\nthat informative nodes dominantly characterize graph signals, we propose a\ncriterion to evaluate the amount of information of each node given its\nneighbors, and theoretically demonstrate its relationship to neighborhood\nconditional entropy. This new criterion determines how nodes are selected and\ncoarsened graphs are constructed in the pooling layer. The resulting\nhierarchical structure yields an effective isomorphism-invariant representation\nof networked data in arbitrary topologies.

We apply the\nstrong-disorder renormalization group method to calculate the sites occupied\nwith an $O(1)$ probability in the stationary state, readily yielding the\npopulation front's position as the outermost site locally as well as globally\nfor the entire boundary. We show that under a quasistatic change of the global\nenvironment, mimicking climate change, the front advances intermittently: long\nquiescent periods are interrupted by rare but long jumps. The characteristics\nof this intermittent dynamics are found to obey universal scaling laws in terms\nof the gradient, conjectured to be related to the correlation-length exponent\nof the model. Our results suggest that current observations might misleadingly\nshow little to no climate response for an extended period of time, concealing\nthe long-term effects of climate change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 15:16:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 17:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

Existing deep\nlearning-based skin lesion segmentation algorithms are expensive in terms of\ncomputational time and memory. Consequently, running such segmentation\nalgorithms requires a powerful GPU and high bandwidth memory, which are not\navailable in dermoscopy devices. Thus, this article aims to achieve precise\nskin lesion segmentation with minimum resources: a lightweight, efficient\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) model called SLSNet, which combines 1-D\nkernel factorized networks, position and channel attention, and multiscale\naggregation mechanisms with a GAN model. The 1-D kernel factorized network\nreduces the computational cost of 2D filtering. The position and channel\nattention modules enhance the discriminative ability between the lesion and\nnon-lesion feature representations in spatial and channel dimensions,\nrespectively. A multiscale block is also used to aggregate the coarse-to-fine\nfeatures of input skin images and reduce the effect of the artifacts. SLSNet is\nevaluated on two publicly available datasets: ISBI 2017 and the ISIC 2018.\nAlthough SLSNet has only 2.35 million parameters, the experimental results\ndemonstrate that it achieves segmentation results on a par with the\nstate-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation methods with an accuracy of 97.61%,\nand Dice and Jaccard similarity coefficients of 90.63% and 81.98%,\nrespectively. SLSNet can run at more than 110 frames per second (FPS) in a\nsingle GTX1080Ti GPU, which is faster than well-known deep learning-based image\nsegmentation models, such as FCN. Therefore, SLSNet can be used for practical\ndermoscopic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 15:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 19:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

Recently, the power consumption has become an\nimportant performance metric in telecommunication due to the associated\nenvironmental issues. In the recent bonding model, customer sites have been\nequipped with two/four copper pairs, which may be exploited for designing\ngrouped spatial modulation (SM) aiming for reducing the power consumption and\nmitigating the stubborn crosstalk in DSL communications. Explicitly, we view\nthe two pair copper pairs equipped for each user as a group and propose an\nenergy efficient transmission scheme based on grouped SM strategy for the\nupstream DSL systems, which is capable of reducing the power consumption of the\nupstream transmitters by activating a single copper line of each user. More\nespecially, in order to compensate for the potential bit-rate reduction imposed\nby reducing the number of activated lines, the proposed scheme implicitly\ndelivers ``virtual bits\" via activating/deactivating the lines in addition to\nthe classic modulation scheme. This is particularly beneficial in the DSL\ncontext, because the cross-talk imposed by activating several lines may swamp\nthe desired signal. Furthermore, a pair of near-optimal soft turbo detection\nschemes are proposed for exploiting the unique properties of the DSL channel in\norder to eliminate the error propagation problem of SM detection routinely\nencountered in wireless channels. Both the attainable energy-efficiency and the\nachievable Bit Error Ratio (BER) are investigated.

We consider a goal-based\nmulti-task RL framework and mechanisms by which previously solved tasks can\nreduce sample complexity and regret when the agent is faced with a new task.\nSpecifically, we introduce two metrics on the state space that encode notions\nof traversibility of the state space for an agent. Using these metrics a\ntopological covering is constructed by way of a set of landmark states in a\nfully self-supervised manner. We show that these landmark coverings confer\ntheoretical advantages for transfer learning within the goal-based multi-task\nRL setting. Specifically, we demonstrate three mechanisms by which landmark\ncoverings can be used for successful transfer learning. First, we extend the\nLandmark Options Via Reflection (LOVR) framework to this new topological\ncovering; second, we use the landmark-centric value functions themselves as\nfeatures and define a greedy zombie policy that achieves near oracle\nperformance on a sequence of zero-shot transfer tasks; finally, motivated by\nthe second transfer mechanism, we introduce a learned reward function that\nprovides a more dense reward signal for goal-based RL. Our novel topological\nlandmark covering confers beneficial theoretical results, bounding the Q values\nat each state-action pair. In doing so, we introduce a mechanism that performs\naction-pruning at infeasible actions which cannot possibly be part of an\noptimal policy for the current goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 15:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

We formalize it as finding an organized latent audio space\nthat represents the capabilities of a synthesizer, while constructing an\ninvertible mapping to the space of its parameters.

The auxiliary variable based on energy\nbounded above does not limited to the hypothetical conditions adopted in\nprevious approaches. We proved the unconditional energy stability for all the\nsemi-discrete schemes carefully and rigorously. The novelty of the proposed\nschemes is that the computed values for the functional in square root are\nguaranteed to be positive. This method, termed novel auxiliary energy variable\n(NAEV) method does not consider any bounded below restrictions any longer.\nHowever, these restrictions are necessary in invariant energy quadratization\n(IEQ) and scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches which are very popular\nmethods recently. This property of guaranteed positivity is not available in\nprevious approaches. A comparative study of classical SAV and NAEV approaches\nis considered to show the accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we present various\n2D numerical simulations to demonstrate the stability and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 09:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 01:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

Intelligence might be an\nunintended consequence of curiosity left to roam free, best exemplified by a\nfrolicking infant. This suggests that our attempts at AI could have been\nmisguided. What we actually need to strive for can be termed artificial\ncuriosity, AC, and intelligence happens as a consequence of those efforts. For\nthis unintentional yet welcome aftereffect to set in a foundational list of\nguiding principles needs to be present. We start with the intuition for this\nline of reasoning and formalize it with a series of definitions, assumptions,\ningredients, models and iterative improvements that will be necessary to make\nthe incubation of intelligence a reality. Our discussion provides conceptual\nmodifications to the Turing Test and to Searle's Chinese room argument.

Typically, this is done via\nhypothesis testing: the statistical properties of the empirical time series are\ntested against those expected under a suitable null hypothesis. This is a very\nchallenging task in complex interacting systems, where statistical stability is\noften poor due to lack of stationarity and ergodicity. Here, we describe an\nunsupervised, data-driven framework to perform hypothesis testing in such\nsituations. This consists of a statistical mechanical approach - analogous to\nthe configuration model for networked systems - for ensembles of time series\ndesigned to preserve, on average, some of the statistical properties observed\non an empirical set of time series. We showcase its possible applications with\na case study on financial portfolio selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 13:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 11:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Using atomic force microscopy, the lift\nforce is probed as a function of the gap size, for various driving velocities,\nviscosities, and stiffnesses. The force increases as the gap is reduced and\nshows a saturation at small gap. The results are in excellent agreement with\nscaling arguments and a quantitative model developed from the soft lubrication\ntheory, in linear elasticity, and for small compliances.
