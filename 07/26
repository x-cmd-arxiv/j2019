In this paper, a\nstatistical approach is proposed, which advantageously utilizes a set of\nprototypical lane change trajectories to realize both early maneuver detection\nand uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction for traffic participants.\nGeneration of prototype trajectories from real traffic data is accomplished by\nAgglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

The future trajectory is predicted\ncombining typical lane change realizations in a mixture model.

Two research branches of the deep\nlearning models, the Generative Networks (GANs, VAE) and the Semantic\nSegmentation, rely highly on the upsampling operations, especially the\ntransposed convolution and the dilated convolution. However, these two types of\nconvolutions are intrinsically different from standard convolution regarding\nthe insertion of zeros in input feature maps or in kernels respectively. This\ndistinct nature severely degrades the performance of the existing deep learning\nengine or frameworks, such as Darknet, Tensorflow, and PyTorch, which are\nmainly developed for the standard convolution.

However, at very small angular\nseparation, their performance in contrast is limited by several factors:\ndiffraction by the complex telescope pupil not perfectly canceled by the\ncoronagraph, residual dynamic wavefront errors, chromatic wavefront errors, and\nwavefront errors resulting from noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs). In a\nprevious work, we demonstrated the use of a Zernike wavefront sensor called\nZELDA for sensing NCPAs in VLT/SPHERE and their compensation. In the present\nwork, we move to the next step with the on-sky validation of NCPA compensation\nwith ZELDA. We start by reproducing previous results on the internal source and\nshow that the amount of aberration integrated between 1 and 15 cycles/pupil is\ndecreased by a factor of five, which translates into a gain in raw contrast of\nbetween 2 and 3 below 300 mas. On sky, we demonstrate that NCPA compensation\nworks in closed loop, leading to an attenuation of the amount of aberration by\na factor of approximately two. However, we identify a loss of sensitivity for\nthe sensor that is only partly explained by the difference in Strehl ratio\nbetween the internal and on-sky measurements. Coronagraphic imaging on sky is\nimproved in raw contrast by a factor of 2.5 at most in the ExAO-corrected\nregion. We use coronagraphic image reconstruction based on a detailed model of\nthe instrument to demonstrate that both internal and on-sky raw contrasts can\nbe precisely explained, and we establish that the observed performance after\nNCPA compensation is no longer limited by an improper compensation for\naberration but by the current apodized-pupil Lyot coronagraph design.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

We developed a method\nthat estimates empirically the star formation quenching times-scales of green\nvalley galaxies, assuming an exponential decay model of the SFH and through a\ncombination of narrow and broad bands from J-PLUS and GALEX. We correlate these\nquenching time-scales with the presence of bars.

While the\nsignificance of its optical periodicity has been debated due to the stochastic\nvariability of quasars, its multi-wavelength variability in the ultraviolet\n(UV) and optical bands is consistent with relativistic Doppler boost caused by\nthe orbital motion in a binary. However, this conclusion was based previously\non sparse UV data which were not taken simultaneously with the optical data.\nHere we report simultaneous follow-up observations of PG1302-102 with the\nUltraviolet Optical Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in six\noptical + UV bands. The additional nine Swift observations produce light curves\nroughly consistent with the trend under the Doppler boost hypothesis, which\npredicts that UV variability should track the optical, but with a ~2.2 times\nhigher amplitude. We perform a statistical analysis to quantitatively test this\nhypothesis. We find that the data are consistent with the Doppler boost\nhypothesis when we compare the the amplitudes in optical B-band and UV light\ncurves. However, the ratio of UV to V-band variability is larger than expected\nand is consistent with the Doppler model, only if either the UV/optical\nspectral slopes vary, the stochastic variability makes a large contribution in\nthe UV, or the sparse new optical data underestimate the true optical\nvariability. We have evidence for the latter from comparison with the optical\nlight curve from ASAS-SN. Additionally, the simultaneous analysis of all four\nbands strongly disfavors the Doppler boost model whenever Swift V-band is\ninvolved.

We identify a set of observables that are sensitive to whether jets\nare quenched as if they are single energetic colored objects or whether the\nmedium that quenches them has the ability to resolve the internal structure of\nthe jet. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find that although the\nungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose (because it is more\nsensitive to effects coming from particles reconstructed as a part of a jet\nthat originate from the wake that the jet leaves in the plasma), groomed\nobservables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings $n_{\\rm SD}$, the\nmomentum sharing fraction $z_g$, or the groomed jet mass are particularly\nwell-suited to discriminate the degree to which the QGP medium resolves\nsubstructure within a jet.

Using a crude estimate\nof this coupling, we perform ab initio calculations of the matrix elements for\nneutrinoless double-beta decay for $^6$He and $^{12}$Be. We speculate on the\nphenomenological impact of the leading short-range operator on the basis of\nthese results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 18:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

A $\\chi^{2}$-method was used to\ndetermine maximum likelihood surfaces for 14 different comets that formed at a\ngiven time (up to 8 Myr) and place (out to beyond the CO iceline) in the\npre-solar nebula midplane. This was done using observed volatile abundances for\nthe 14 comets and the evolution of volatile abundances from chemical modelling\nof disk midplanes. Considering all parent species (ten molecules) in a scenario\nthat assumed reset initial chemistry, the $\\chi^{2}$ likelihood surfaces show a\ncharacteristic trail in the parameter space with high likelihood of formation\naround 30 AU at early times and 12 AU at later times for ten comets. This trail\nroughly traces the vicinity of the CO iceline in time. The formation histories\nfor all comets were thereby constrained to the vicinity of the CO iceline,\nassuming that the chemistry was partially reset early in the pre-solar nebula.\nThis is found, both when considering carbon-, oxygen-, and sulphur-bearing\nmolecules (ten in total), and when only considering carbon- and oxygen-bearing\nmolecules (seven in total). Since these 14 comets did not previously fall into\nthe same taxonomical categories together, this chemical constraint may be\nproposed as an alternative taxonomy for comets. Based on the most likely time\nfor each of these comets to have formed during the disk chemical evolution, a\nformation time classification for the 14 comets is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 18:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Given a manifold $M$, we\nseek the minimum dimension $TN(M)$ such that there exists a totally nonparallel\nimmersion $M \\to \\mathbb{R}^{TN(M)}$. In analogy with the totally skew\nembeddings studied by Ghomi and Tabachnikov, we find that totally nonparallel\nimmersions are related to the generalized vector field problem, the immersion\nproblem for real projective spaces, and nonsingular symmetric bilinear maps.\n  Our study of totally nonparallel immersions follows a recent trend of\nstudying conditions which manifest on the configuration space $F_k(M)$ of\nk-tuples of distinct points of $M$; for example, k-regular embeddings, k-skew\nembeddings, k-neighborly embeddings, etc. Typically, a map satisfying one of\nthese configuration space conditions induces some $S_k$-equivariant map on the\nconfiguration space $F_k(M)$ (or on a bundle thereof) and obstructions can be\ncomputed using Stiefel-Whitney classes. However, the existence problem for such\nconditions is relatively unstudied.\n  Our main result is a Whitney-type theorem: every $n$-manifold $M$ admits a\ntotally nonparallel immersion into $\\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$, one dimension less than\ngiven by genericity. We begin by studying the local problem, which requires a\nthorough understanding of the space of nonsingular symmetric bilinear maps,\nafter which the main theorem is established using the removal-of-singularities\nh-principle technique due to Gromov and Eliashberg.

Gaussian Process\n(GP) surrogate modeling replaces the expensive function with a\ncheap-to-evaluate data-driven probabilistic model. While the GP does not assume\na functional form of the problem, it is defined by a set of parameters, called\nhyperparameters. The hyperparameters define the characteristics of the\nobjective function, such as smoothness, magnitude, periodicity, etc. Accurately\nestimating these hyperparameters is a key ingredient in developing a reliable\nand generalizable surrogate model. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a\nubiquitously used Bayesian method to estimate these hyperparameters.

It also uses a new objective function\nin training model that uses a correlation distance measure in penalty terms by\nmeasuring dependency of the latent target features and the model (latent\nfeatures and enhanced features obtained from the DAE). Performance of the\nproposed method was compared against a conventional model and a state of the\nart model under both seen and unseen noisy environments of 7 different types of\nbackground noise with different SNR levels (0, 5, 10 and 20 dB). The proposed\nmethod also is tested using linear and non-linear penalty terms as well, where,\nthey both show an improvement on the overall average WER under noisy conditions\nboth seen and unseen in comparison to the state-of-the-art model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 02:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

The\nstrongest adversary in quantum sensing is decoherence due to the coupling\nbetween the sensor and the environment. The dissipation will destroy the\nquantum coherence and reduce the performance of quantum sensing. Here we show\nthat quantum sensing can be realized by engineering the steady-state of the\nquantum sensor under dissipation. We demonstrate this protocol with a\nmagnetometer based on ensemble Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, while\nneither high-quality initialization/readout of the sensor nor sophisticated\ndynamical decoupling sequences is required. Thus our method provides a concise\nand decoherence-resistant fashion of quantum sensing. The frequency resolution\nand precision of our magnetometer are far beyond the coherence time of the\nsensor. Furthermore, we show that the dissipation can be engineered to improve\nthe performance of our quantum sensing. By increasing the laser pumping,\nmagnetic signal in a broad audio-frequency band from DC up to 140 kHz can be\ntackled by our method.

SIRI covers the energy range from 0.04-8 MeV\nand was launched into 600 km sun-synchronous orbit on Dec 3, 2018 onboard\nSTPSat5 with a one-year mission to investigate the detector's response to\non-orbit background radiation. The detector has an active volume of 11.6 cm3\nand a photo fraction efficiency of 50% at 662 keV for gamma-rays parallel to\nthe long axis of the crystal. Its spectroscopic resolution of 4.3% was measured\nby the FWHM of the characteristic Cs-137 gamma-ray line at 662 keV. Measured\nbackground rates external to the trapped particle regions are 40-50 counts per\nsecond for energies greater than 40 keV and are largely the result of short-\nand long-term activation products generated by transits of the SAA and the\ncontinual cosmic-ray bombardment. Rate maps determined from energy cuts of the\ncollected spectral data show the expected contributions from the various\ntrapped particle regions. Early spectra acquired by the instrument show the\npresence of at least 10 characteristic gamma-ray lines and a beta continuum\ngenerated by activation products within the detector and surrounding materials.\nAs of April 2019, the instrument has acquired over 1000 hours of data and is\nexpected to continue operations until the space vehicle is decommissioned in\nDec. 2019. Results indicate SrI2:Eu provides a feasible alternative to\ntraditional sodium iodide and cesium iodide scintillators, especially for\nmissions where a factor-of-two improvement in energy resolution would represent\na significant difference in scientific return. To the best of our knowledge,\nSIRI is the first on-orbit use of SrI2:Eu scintillator with SiPM readouts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 02:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

However, compared with ECG-synchronized cardiac\nCT, chest CT is more prevalent and economical in clinical practice. To address\nthis, we propose an automatic method based on Dense U-Net to segment coronary\ncalcium pixels on both types of CT scans. Our contribution is two-fold. First,\nwe propose a novel network called DenseRAUnet, which takes advantage of Dense\nU-net, ResNet and atrous convolutions. We prove the robustness and\ngeneralizability of our model by training it exclusively on chest CT while test\non both types of CT scans. Second, we design a loss function combining\nbootstrap with IoU function to balance foreground and background classes.\nDenseRAUnet is trained in a 2.5D fashion and tested on a private dataset\nconsisting of 144 scans. Results show an F1-score of 0.75, with 0.83 accuracy\nof predicting cardiovascular disease risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 06:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

However, there is still a long way for SS to be put\ninto practice as there are two essential challenges that need to be addressed:\nefficiency and evaluation criterions for practical application. For specific\napplication scenarios, different criterions need to be adopted. Recall rate is\nan important criterion for many tasks like autonomous vehicles. For autonomous\nvehicles, we need to focus on the detection of the traffic objects like cars,\nbuses, and pedestrians, which should be detected with high recall rates. In\nother words, it is preferable to detect it wrongly than miss it, because the\nother traffic objects will be dangerous if the algorithm miss them and segment\nthem as safe roadways. In this paper, our main goal is to explore possible\nmethods to attain high recall rate. Firstly, we propose a real-time SS network\nnamed Swift Factorized Network (SFN). The proposed network is adapted from\nSwiftNet, whose structure is a typical U-shape structure with lateral\nconnections. Inspired by ERFNet and Global convolution Networks (GCNet), we\npropose two different blocks to enlarge valid receptive field.

Such low summertime oxygen contents especially affect benthic\nlife. The seasonal coastal hypoxia is commonly related to biological increased\nrespiration and to physical limited vertical turbulent exchange that is\nassociated with increased vertical stable density stratification. However, the\nsame stratification can support internal waves that may break and locally\ngenerate turbulence. Here, we investigate the physics of internal wave motions\nin saltwater Lake Grevelingen (SW-Netherlands) during warming in mid-spring.\nGrevelingen is refreshed by weak tidal motions through an open sluice in its\ndam to the North Sea. The outer North Sea has a surface tidal range of about 3\nm, but the lake surface tidal range is negligible (<0.1 m). To quantify\nvertical turbulent exchange, high-resolution temperature sensors were moored in\nconjunction with a current meter in 36 m water depth for three days. The site\nis known for anoxic conditions near the bottom in summer. While a 3-day, 30-m\nmean eddy diffusivity of <[Kz]> = 4+/-2x10-5 m2 s-1 is found, the overall mean\nturbulence dissipation rate (turbulent flux) is <[epsilon]> = 1.1+/-0.6x10-7 m2\ns-3. Turbulent mixing occurs episodically, via near-surface cooling during\nnight and increased winds, via sparse shear-driven breaking of internal waves\nat the main pycnocline, and via sheared near-bottom currents. Shear-driven\nturbulence is not commonly found in fresh-water lakes. Just below the main\npycnocline around mid-depth a layer of weak turbulence is observed, as in\nfresh-water lakes. The observed turbulent exchange is sufficient to warm the\nnear-bottom waters over the course of summer, but insufficient to prevent the\nbiology from over-consuming oxygen contents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 07:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

To simply\ndemonstrate how the spin-orbit-coupling effect modifies the two-body\nshort-range behavior, we solve the two-body problem in the sub-Hilbert space of\nzero center-of-mass momentum and zero total angular momentum, and\nperturbatively take the spin-orbit-coupling effect into account at short\ndistance, since the strength of the spin-orbit coupling should be much smaller\nthan the corresponding scale of the finite range of interatomic interactions.\nThe universal asymptotic forms of the two-body wave function at short distance\nare then derived, which do not depend on the short-range details of interatomic\npotentials. We find that new scattering parameters need to be introduced\nbecause of spin-orbit coupling, besides the traditional $s$- and $p$-wave\nscattering length (volume) and effective ranges. This is a general and unique\nfeature for spin-orbit-coupled systems.

Because thermal\ncameras visualize thermal radiation, they are not subject to the same\nlimitations as RGB cameras. However, because RGB and thermal imaging differ\nsignificantly in appearance, common, state-of-the-art feature descriptors are\nunsuitable for intermodal feature matching between these imaging modalities. As\na consequence, visual maps created with an RGB camera can currently not be used\nfor localization using a thermal camera. In this paper, we introduce the\nSemantic Deep Intermodal Feature Transfer (Se-DIFT), an approach for\ntransferring image feature descriptors from the visual to the thermal spectrum\nand vice versa. For this purpose, we predict potential feature appearance in\nvarying imaging modalities using a deep convolutional encoder-decoder\narchitecture in combination with a global feature vector. Since the\nrepresentation of a thermal image is not only affected by features which can be\nextracted from an RGB image, we introduce the global feature vector which\naugments the auto encoder's coding. The global feature vector contains\nadditional information about the thermal history of a scene which is\nautomatically extracted from external data sources. By augmenting the encoder's\ncoding, we decrease the L1 error of the prediction by more than 7% compared to\nthe prediction of a traditional U-Net architecture. To evaluate our approach,\nwe match image feature descriptors detected in RGB and thermal images using\nSe-DIFT. Subsequently, we make a competitive comparison on the intermodal\ntransferability of SIFT, SURF, and ORB features using our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 08:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

The observed gamma-ray emission from\nthese sources at GeV-TeV energies is described by unusual hard spectral\nindices. The observed spectral and temporal characteristics of these sources\nchallenge the standard leptonic models for the broad-band emissions from\nblazars. Therefore, such sources provide astrophysical sites to investigate\ndirectly the particle acceleration, cooling of relativistic particles and\nindirectly probe the cosmological quantities like extragalactic background\nlight (EBL) and intergalactic magnetic field (IMF) in the Universe. In this\nstudy, we investigate the spectral properties of the gamma-ray emission from\nEHSP blazars using observations from the Fermi-LAT catalogues (3FGL and 3FHL)\nalong with the TeV observations using ground based telescopes. The observed TeV\ngamma-ray spectra are corrected for the EBL absorption using the most recent\nand updated EBL models to determine the intrinsic spectrum at the source. The\nintrinsic TeV spectra are combined with the MeV-GeV observations from the\nFermi-LAT to study the gamma-ray emission from EHSP blazars in the broad energy\nband. The intrinsic gamma-ray spectra are then used to estimate the position of\nhigh energy peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also present the\nqualitative description for the observed spectral properties of EHSP blazars\nusing different physical scenarios and discuss their importance for the\nupcoming CTA observatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 09:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

The main contribution of this work is to consider the challenging\ncase where the nonsmooth function corresponds to a sum of non-convex functions,\nresulting from composition between a strictly increasing, concave,\ndifferentiable function and a convex nonsmooth function. The proposed variable\nmetric Composite Function Forward-Backward algorithm (C2FB) circumvents the\nexplicit, and often challenging, computation of the proximity operator of the\ncomposite functions through a majorize-minimize approach. Precisely, each\ncomposite function is majorized using a linear approximation of the\ndifferentiable function, which allows one to apply the proximity step only to\nthe sum of the nonsmooth functions. We prove the convergence of the algorithm\niterates to a critical point of the objective function leveraging the\nKurdyka-\\L ojasiewicz inequality. The convergence is guaranteed even if the\nproximity operators are computed inexactly, considering relative errors. We\nshow that the proposed approach is a generalization of reweighting methods,\nwith convergence guarantees.

Several earlier studies have shown\nthat the shrinkage of model coefficients can reduce overfitting of the\nprediction model and subsequently result in better predictive performance on\naverage. In this simulation study, we aimed to investigate the variability of\nregression shrinkage on predictive performance for a binary outcome, with focus\non the calibration slope. The slope indicates whether risk predictions are too\nextreme (slope < 1) or not extreme enough (slope > 1). We investigated the\nfollowing shrinkage methods in comparison to standard maximum likelihood\nestimation: uniform shrinkage (likelihood-based and bootstrap-based), ridge\nregression, penalized maximum likelihood, LASSO regression, adaptive LASSO,\nnon-negative garrote, and Firth's correction. There were three main findings.\nFirst, shrinkage improved calibration slopes on average. Second, the\nbetween-sample variability of calibration slopes was often increased relative\nto maximum likelihood. Among the shrinkage methods, the bootstrap-based uniform\nshrinkage worked well overall. In contrast to other shrinkage approaches,\nFirth's correction had only a small shrinkage effect but did so with low\nvariability. Third, the correlation between the estimated shrinkage and the\noptimal shrinkage to remove overfitting was typically negative. Hence, although\nshrinkage improved predictions on average, it often worked poorly in individual\ndatasets, in particular when shrinkage was most needed. The observed\nvariability of shrinkage methods implies that these methods do not solve\nproblems associated with small sample size or low number of events per\nvariable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 11:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

In experiments\nthe prepared state generally deviates from the target state due to some noise.\nNormally the white noise model is applied to quantifying such derivation and in\nthe same time reveals the robustness of the witness. However, there may exist\nother kind of noise, in which the coherent noise can dramatically \"rotate\" the\nprepared state. In this way, the coherent noise is likely to lead to a failure\nof the detection, even though the underlying state is actually entangled. In\nthis work, we propose an efficient entanglement detection protocol for\n$N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. The protocol can\neliminate the effect of the coherent noise and in the same time feedback the\ncorresponding noise parameters, which are beneficial to further improvements on\nthe experiment system. In particular, we consider two experiment-relevant\ncoherent noise models, one is from the unconscious phase accumulation on $N$\nqubits, the other is from the rotation on the control qubit. The protocol\neffectively realizes a family of entanglement witnesses by postprocessing the\nmeasurement results from $N+2$ local measurement settings, which only adds one\nmore setting than the original witness specialized for the GHZ state. Moreover,\nby considering the trade-off between the detection efficiency and the\nwhite-noise robustness, we further reduce the number of local measurements to 3\nwithout altering the performance on the coherent noise. Our protocol can\nenhance the entanglement detection under coherent noises and act as a benchmark\nfor the state-of-the-art quantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 11:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 12:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In\nthe event of noisy, expensive, or stochastic simulators, evaluating gradients\nvia finite differencing may be infeasible. In such cases, often a surrogate\nmodel is employed, on which finite differencing is performed. When the\nsurrogate model is a Gaussian process, we show that the ASM estimator is\navailable in closed form, rendering the finite-difference approximation\nunnecessary. We use our closed-form solution to develop acquisition functions\nfocused on sequential learning tailored to sensitivity analysis on top of ASMs.\nWe also show that the traditional ASM estimator may be viewed as a method of\nmoments estimator for a certain class of Gaussian processes. We demonstrate how\nuncertainty on Gaussian process hyperparameters may be propagated to\nuncertainty on the sensitivity analysis, allowing model-based confidence\nintervals on the active subspace. Our methodological developments are\nillustrated on several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 13:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 16:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Specifically, we study (possibly\nnon-invertible) maps with a time-varying parameter subject to a parameter\nshift. We show that each stable path has a unique associated solution (a local\npullback attractor) which stays near the path for all negative time. When the\nparameter changes slowly, this local pullback attractor stays near the path for\nall time, but if the parameter changes quickly, the local pullback attractor\nmay move away from the path in positive time; this is the phenomenon of\nR-tipping. We demonstrate that forward basin stability is an insufficient\ncondition to prevent R-tipping in maps of any dimension but that forward\ninflowing stability is sufficient. Furthermore, we show that R-tipping will\nhappen when there is a certain kind of forward basin instability, and we prove\nprecisely what happens to the local pullback attractor as the rate of the\nparameter change approaches infinity.

To explore this\nidea, we incorporate a parameter $\\sigma$ that represents the fraction of\nneighbors of an updating node that share its opinion state. In an update, with\nprobability $\\sigma^q$ (for some nonlinearity parameter $q$), the updating node\nrewires; with complementary probability $1-\\sigma^q$, the updating node adopts\na new opinion state. We study this mechanism using three rewiring schemes:\nafter an updating node deletes a discordant edge, it then either (1)\n\"rewires-to-random\" by choosing a new neighbor in a random process; (2)\n\"rewires-to-same\" by choosing a new neighbor in a random process from nodes\nthat share its state; or (3) \"rewires-to-none\" by not rewiring at all (akin to\n\"unfriending\" on social media). We compare our nonlinear coevolving model to\nseveral existing linear models, and we find in our model that initial network\ntopology plays a larger role in the dynamics and the choice of rewiring\nmechanism plays a smaller role. A particularly interesting feature of our model\nis that, under certain conditions, the opinion state that is held initially by\na minority of the nodes can effectively spread to almost every node in a\nnetwork if the minority nodes view themselves as the majority. In light of this\nobservation, we relate our results to recent work on the majority illusion in\nsocial networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 14:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 03:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

We thereby consider\ntwo models for the operation of such a network. The first is a continuous\nmodel, in which entanglement between a subset of the nodes is produced\ncontinuously in the background. This can in principle allows the rapid creation\nof entanglement between more distant nodes using the already pre-generated\nentanglement pairs in the network. The second is an on-demand model, where\nentanglement production does not commence before a request is made. Our\nobjective is to find protocols, that minimise the latency of the network to\nserve a request to create entanglement between two distant nodes in the\nnetwork. We propose three routing algorithms and analytically show that as\nexpected when there is only a single request in the network, then employing\nthem on the continuous model yields a lower latency than on the on-demand one.\nWe study the performance of the routing algorithms in a ring, grid, and\nrecursively generated network topologies. We also give an analytical upper\nbound on the number of entanglement swap operations the nodes need to perform\nfor routing entangled links between a source and a destination yielding a lower\nbound on the end to end fidelity of the shared entangled state. We proceed to\nstudy the case of multiple concurrent requests and show that in some of the\nscenarios the on-demand model can outperform the continuous one. Using\nnumerical simulations on ring and grid networks we also study the behaviour of\nthe latency of all the routing algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nself-supervised learning assisted pulmonary nodule detection framework based on\na 3D Feature Pyramid Network (3DFPN) to improve the sensitivity of nodule\ndetection by employing multi-scale features to increase the resolution of\nnodules, as well as a parallel top-down path to transit the high-level semantic\nfeatures to complement low-level general features. Furthermore, a High\nSensitivity and Specificity (HS2) network is introduced to eliminate the false\npositive nodule candidates by tracking the appearance changes in continuous CT\nslices of each nodule candidate on Location History Images (LHI). In addition,\nin order to improve the performance consistency of the proposed framework\nacross data captured by different CT scanners without using additional\nannotations, an effective self-supervised learning schema is applied to learn\nspatiotemporal features of CT scans from large-scale unlabeled data. The\nperformance and robustness of our method are evaluated on several publicly\navailable datasets with significant performance improvements. The proposed\nframework is able to accurately detect pulmonary nodules with high sensitivity\nand specificity and achieves 90.6% sensitivity with 1/8 false positive per scan\nwhich outperforms the state-of-the-art results 15.8% on LUNA16 dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 21:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

The online setting,\nhowever, poses a subtly different question: \"Given the natural sequence of\nuser-item interactions up to time t, can we get the user to interact with a\nrecommended item at time t+1?\". From a causal perspective, the system performs\nan intervention, and we want to measure its effect. Next-item prediction is\noften used as a fall-back objective when information about interventions and\ntheir effects (shown recommendations and whether they received a click) is\nunavailable. When this type of data is available, however, it can provide great\nvalue for reliably estimating online recommender system performance.

In contrast to conventional instance\nsegmentation scenarios in computer vision, the problems that we consider are\ncharacterized by a small number of training images and non-local patterns that\nlead to the diagnosis. In this paper, we explore the use of multiple instance\nlearning (MIL) to design an instance label generator under this weakly\nsupervised setting. Motivated by the observation that an MIL model can handle\nbags of varying sizes, we propose to repurpose an MIL model originally trained\nfor bag-level classification to produce reliable predictions for single\ninstances, i.e., bags of size $1$. To this end, we introduce a novel\nregularization strategy based on virtual adversarial training for improving MIL\ntraining, and subsequently develop a knowledge distillation technique for\nrepurposing the trained MIL model. Using empirical studies on colon cancer and\nbreast cancer detection from histopathological images, we show that the\nproposed approach produces high-quality instance-level prediction and\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the MIL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 04:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Work in the literature either provides approaches to\nwhole-body segmentation and tracking, which, however, has poor clinical value,\nor retrieve a posteriori limb pose from limb segmentation, increasing\ncomputational costs and introducing inaccuracy sources. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of limb-pose estimation under a different point of view. We\nproposed a 2D fully-convolutional neural network for roughly detecting limb\njoints and joint connections, followed by a regression convolutional neural\nnetwork for accurate joint and joint-connection position estimation. Joints\nfrom the same limb are then connected with a maximum bipartite matching\napproach. Our analysis does not require any prior modeling of infants' body\nstructure, neither any manual interventions.

Conventional methods heavily depend on feature engineering or syntactic\nparsing, they are inefficient or error-cascading. Recently, leveraging\nsupervised deep learning structures to address the ORE task is an\nextraordinarily promising way. However, there are two main challenges: (1) The\nlack of enough labeled corpus to support supervised training; (2) The\nexploration of specific neural architecture that adapts to the characteristics\nof open relation extracting. In this paper, to overcome these difficulties, we\nbuild a large-scale, high-quality training corpus in a fully automated way, and\ndesign a tagging scheme to assist in transforming the ORE task into a sequence\ntagging processing. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid neural network model\n(HNN4ORT) for open relation tagging. The model employs the Ordered Neurons LSTM\nto encode potential syntactic information for capturing the associations among\nthe arguments and relations.

Nonetheless, from our\nanalysis, the idea of combining genetic algorithm with a batch of base learners\nstill has its shortcomings. The effectiveness of genetic algorithm can hardly\nbe guaranteed if the unit models converge to close or the same solutions.
