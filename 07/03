In\nan LED array microscope, the light source of a conventional widefield\nmicroscope is replaced with a 2-dimensional LED matrix. A stack of images is\nacquired from the LED array microscope by sequentially illuminating each LED\nand capturing an image. Previous work has shown that we can achieve digital\nrefocusing by post-processing this LED image stack.

This process is vital for creating\nspace in which the cancer cells can progress and it is driven by the activities\nof specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

We propose a general\nquantitative framework of polymer bending that includes both the weak and\nstrong bending regimes on the same footing, based on a single general physical\nprinciple. As the bending deformation increases beyond a certain\n(polymer-specific) point, the change in the convexity properties of the\neffective bending energy of the polymer makes the harmonic deformation\nenergetically unfavorable: in this strong bending regime the energy of the\npolymer varies linearly with the average bending angle as the system follows\nthe convex hull of the deformation energy function. For double-stranded DNA,\nthe effective bending deformation energy becomes non-convex for bends greater\nthan about 2 degrees per base-pair, equivalent to the curvature of a closed\ncircular loop of about 160 base pairs. A simple equation is derived for the\npolymer loop energy that covers both the weak and strong bending regimes.

The first rule generates only periodic\ntilings, while the second generates tilings for which any associated Delone set\nis non-equivalent to any lattice in space. As an extension of this result, we\nintroduce arbitrarily many distinct substitution rules associated with a single\nmatrix, with the property that Delone sets generated by distinct rules are\nnon-equivalent. We then turn to the study of mixed substitution tilings, and\npresent a mixed substitution system that generates representatives of\ncontinuously many distinct BD equivalence classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 19:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 07:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Several tools such as TravisCI,\nCircleCI, and Hudson, that implement CI practices, are commonly adopted by\nsoftware engineers. However, the way that software engineers use these tools\ncould lead to what we call \"Continuous Integration Theater\", a situation in\nwhich software engineers do not employ these tools effectively, leading to\nunhealthy CI practices. Aims: The goal of this paper is to make sense of how\ncommonplace are these unhealthy continuous integration practices being employed\nin practice. Method: By inspecting 1,270 open-source projects that use\nTravisCI, the most used CI service, we quantitatively studied how common is to\nuse CI (1) with infrequent commits, (2) in a software project with poor test\ncoverage, (3) with builds that stay broken for long periods, and (4) with\nbuilds that take too long to run. Results: We observed that 748 ($sim$60%)\nprojects face infrequent commits, which essentially makes the merging process\nharder. Moreover, we were able to find code coverage information for 51\nprojects. The average code coverage was 78%, although Ruby projects have a\nhigher code coverage than Java projects (86% and 63%, respectively). However,\nsome projects with very small coverage ($sim$4%) were found. Still, we observed\nthat 85% of the studied projects have at least one broken build that take more\nthan four days to be fixed. Interestingly, very small projects (up to 1,000\nlines of code) are the ones that take the longest to fix broken builds.\nFinally, we noted that, for the majority of the studied projects, the build is\nexecuted under the 10 minutes rule of thumb. Conclusions: Our results are\nimportant to an increasing community of software engineers that employ CI\npractices on daily basis but may not be aware of bad practices that are\neventually employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 19:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

A graph $G$ is called $F$-saturated if $G$ does\nnot contain a subgraph isomorphic to $F$, but the addition of any edge creates\na copy of $F$. We first resolve a fundamental question of minimizing the number\nof cliques of size $r$ in a $K_s$-saturated graph for all sufficiently large\nnumbers of vertices, confirming a conjecture of Kritschgau, Methuku, Tait, and\nTimmons. We also go further and prove a corresponding stability result. Next we\nminimize the number of cycles of length $r$ in a $K_s$-saturated graph for all\nsufficiently large numbers of vertices, and classify the extremal graphs for\nmost values of $r$, answering another question of Kritschgau, Methuku, Tait,\nand Timmons for most $r$.

Pikhurko made progress in the negative direction by considering families\nof graphs instead of a single graph, and proved that there exists a graph\nfamily $\\mathcal{F}$ of size $4$ for which $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\n\\frac{\\sat(n, \\mathcal{F})}{n}$ does not exist (for a family of graphs\n$\\mathcal{F}$, a graph $G$ is called $\\mathcal{F}$-saturated if $G$ does not\ncontain a copy of any graph in $\\mathcal{F}$, but the addition of any edge\ncreates a copy of a graph in $\\mathcal{F}$, and $\\sat(n, \\mathcal{F})$ is\ndefined similarly).

However,\nthese methods do not explore the relationship between the bars, and the\nconnected song as a whole has no musical form structure and sense of musical\ndirection. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-model Multi-task\nHierarchical Conditional VAE-GAN (Variational Autoencoder-Generative\nadversarial networks) networks, named MIDI-Sandwich, which combines musical\nknowledge, such as musical form, tonic, and melodic motion. The MIDI-Sandwich\nhas two submodels: Hierarchical Conditional Variational Autoencoder (HCVAE) and\nHierarchical Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (HCGAN). The HCVAE uses\nhierarchical structure. The underlying layer of HCVAE uses Local Conditional\nVariational Autoencoder (L-CVAE) to generate a music bar which is pre-specified\nby the First and Last Notes (FLN). The upper layer of HCVAE uses Global\nVariational Autoencoder(G-VAE) to analyze the latent vector sequence generated\nby the L-CVAE encoder, to explore the musical relationship between the bars,\nand to produce the song pieced together by multiple music bars generated by the\nL-CVAE decoder, which makes the song both have musical structure and sense of\ndirection. At the same time, the HCVAE shares a part of itself with the HCGAN\nto further improve the performance of the generated music. The MIDI-Sandwich is\nvalidated on the Nottingham dataset and is able to generate a single-track\nmelody sequence (17x8 beats), which is superior to the length of most of the\ngenerated models (8 to 32 beats). Meanwhile, by referring to the experimental\nmethods of many classical kinds of literature, the quality evaluation of the\ngenerated music is performed.

In continuation of Goodrich et al.'s early\nefforts, explicitly espousing the goal of putting the MapReduce framework on\nfooting equal to that of long-established models such as the PRAM, we\ninvestigate the obvious complexity question of how the computational power of\nMapReduce algorithms compares to that of combinational Boolean circuits\ncommonly used for parallel computations. Relying on the standard MapReduce\nmodel introduced by Karloff et al. a decade ago, we develop an intricate\nsimulation technique to show that any problem in NC (i.e., a problem solved by\na logspace-uniform family of Boolean circuits of polynomial size and a depth\npolylogarithmic in the input size) can be solved by a MapReduce computation in\nO(T(n)/ log n) rounds, where n is the input size and T(n) is the depth of the\nwitnessing circuit family. Thus, we are able to closely relate the standard,\nuniform NC hierarchy modeling parallel computations to the deterministic\nMapReduce hierarchy DMRC by proving that NC^(i+1) is contained in DMRC^i for\nall natural i, including 0. Besides the theoretical significance, this result\nthat has important applied aspects as well.

The analogous diagnostic in quantum\nmany-body systems is an exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlation\nfunctions (OTOCs). These quantities can be computed for various models, but\ntheir experimental study requires the ability to evolve quantum states backward\nin time, similar to the canonical Loschmidt echo measurement. In some simple\nsystems, backward time evolution can be achieved by reversing the sign of the\nHamiltonian; however in most interacting many-body systems, this is not a\nviable option. Here we propose a new family of protocols for OTOC measurement\nthat do not require backward time evolution. Instead, they rely on ordinary\ntime-ordered measurements performed in the thermofield double (TFD) state, an\nentangled state formed between two identical copies of the system. We show\nthat, remarkably, in this situation the Lyapunov chaos exponent $\\lambda_L$ can\nbe extracted from the measurement of an ordinary two-point correlation\nfunction. As an unexpected bonus, we find that our proposed method yields the\nso-called \"regularized\" OTOC -- a quantity that is believed to most directly\nindicate quantum chaos. According to recent theoretical work, the TFD state can\nbe prepared as the ground state of two weakly coupled identical systems and is\ntherefore amenable to experimental study.

Background: Current technology\n(electromyography, dynamometry, shear wave imaging) provides no general,\nnon-invasive method for online estimation of skeletal intramuscular states.\nUltrasound (US) allows non-invasive imaging of muscle, yet current\ncomputational approaches have never achieved simultaneous extraction nor\ngeneralisation of independently varying, active and passive states. We use deep\nlearning to investigate the generalizable content of 2D US muscle images.\nMethod: US data synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles, with\nmeasures of joint moment/angle were recorded from 32 healthy participants (7\nfemale, ages: 27.5, 19-65). We extracted a region of interest of medial\ngastrocnemius and soleus using our prior developed accurate segmentation\nalgorithm. From the segmented images, a deep convolutional neural network was\ntrained to predict three absolute, drift-free, components of the\nneurobiomechanical state (activity, joint angle, joint moment) during\nexperimentally designed, simultaneous, independent variation of passive (joint\nangle) and active (electromyography) inputs. Results: For all 32 held-out\nparticipants (16-fold cross-validation) the ankle joint angle,\nelectromyography, and joint moment were estimated to accuracy 55+-8%, 57+-11%,\nand 46+-9% respectively. Significance: With 2D US imaging, deep neural networks\ncan encode in generalizable form, the activity-length-tension state\nrelationship of muscle. Observation only, low power, 2D US imaging can provide\na new category of technology for non-invasive estimation of neural output,\nlength and tension in skeletal muscle.

Determining the homotopy type of the space of such closed curves\nor, more generally, of spaces of such curves with prescribed initial and final\njets appears to be a hard problem, which has been solved for $n=2$ but\notherwise remains open.

In that case, the\nworldsheet theory itself becomes non-relativistic and the dilaton coupling\nvanishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 22:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 14:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

Feedback control strategies for minimizing this transient energy growth\ncan be formulated as convex optimization problems based on linear matrix\ninequalities. Unfortunately, solving the requisite linear matrix inequality\nproblem can be computationally prohibitive within the context of\nhigh-dimensional fluid flows. In this work, we investigate the utility of\ncontrol-oriented reduced-order models to facilitate the design of feedback flow\ncontrol strategies that minimize the maximum transient energy growth. An output\nprojection onto proper orthogonal decomposition modes is used to faithfully\ncapture the system energy. Subsequently, a balanced truncation is performed to\nreduce the state dimension, while preserving the system's input-output\nproperties. The model reduction and control approaches are studied within the\ncontext of a linearized channel flow with blowing and suction actuation at the\nwalls. Controller synthesis for this linearized channel flow system becomes\ntractable through the use of the proposed control-oriented reduced-order\nmodels. Further, the resulting controllers are found to reduce the maximum\ntransient energy growth compared with more conventional linear quadratic\noptimal control strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 22:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

Firstly, there is substantial\nnoise in the dialogue state annotations and dialogue utterances which\nnegatively impact the performance of state-tracking models. Secondly, follow-up\nwork (Lee et al., 2019) has augmented the original dataset with user dialogue\nacts. This leads to multiple co-existent versions of the same dataset with\nminor modifications. In this work we tackle the aforementioned issues by\nintroducing MultiWOZ 2.1. To fix the noisy state annotations, we use\ncrowdsourced workers to re-annotate state and utterances based on the original\nutterances in the dataset. This correction process results in changes to over\n32% of state annotations across 40% of the dialogue turns. In addition, we fix\n146 dialogue utterances by canonicalizing slot values in the utterances to the\nvalues in the dataset ontology. To address the second problem, we combined the\ncontributions of the follow-up works into MultiWOZ 2.1.

The three-dimensional (3D)\nturbulent Mach number, $\\mathcal{M}$, allows us to predict the rate of star\nformation.

In this work, we propose a method for serial\nquantization of sparse time sequences (SQuaTS) inspired by group testing\ntheory, which is designed to reliably and accurately quantize sparse signals\nacquired in a sequential manner using serial scalar ADCs. Unlike previously\nproposed approaches which combine quantization and compressed sensing (CS), our\nSQuaTS scheme updates its representation on each incoming analog sample and\ndoes not require the complete signal to be observed and stored in analog prior\nto quantization. We characterize the asymptotic tradeoff between accuracy and\nquantization rate of SQuaTS as well as its computational burden. We also\npropose a variation of SQuaTS, which trades rate for computational efficiency.\nNext, we show how SQuaTS can be naturally extended to distributed quantization\nscenarios, where a set of jointly sparse time sequences are acquired\nindividually and processed jointly. Our numerical results demonstrate that\nSQuaTS is capable of achieving substantially improved representation accuracy\nover previous CS-based schemes without requiring the complete set of analog\nsignal samples to be observed prior to its quantization, making it an\nattractive approach for acquiring sparse time sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 00:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 14:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 20:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

For X0=1/2, in the\nnon-cryptographic setting, Blum's majority protocol is $\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}$\ninsecure. For computationally bounded adversaries and any X0 in [0,1], the\nprotocol of Moran,Naor,Segev (2009) is only O(1/n) insecure. In this paper, we\nstudy discrete-time martingales (X0,X1,..,Xn) such that Xi in [0,1], for all i\nin {0,..,n}, and Xn in {0,1}. In particular, for any X0 in [0,1], we construct\nmartingales that yield $\\frac12\\sqrt{\\frac{X_0(1-X_0)}{n}}$ insecure\ncoin-tossing protocols with n-bit communication; irrespective of the number of\nbits required to represent the output distribution. Note that for sufficiently\nsmall X0, we achieve higher security than Moran et al's protocol even against\ncomputationally unbounded adversaries. For X0=1/2, our protocol requires only\n40% of the processors to obtain the same security as the majority protocol. We\nintroduce a new inductive technique that uses geometric transformations to\nestimate the large gaps in these martingales.

The attention routing is a\nrouting between capsules through an attention module. The attention routing is\na fast forward-pass while keeping spatial information. On the other hand, the\nintuitive interpretation of the dynamic routing is finding a centroid of the\nprediction capsules. Thus, the squash activation function and its variant focus\non preserving a vector orientation. However, the capsule activation focuses on\nperforming a capsule-scale activation function.\n  We evaluate our proposed model on the MNIST, affNIST, and CIFAR-10\nclassification tasks.

It undergoes a\nlong-range AF order at TN = 24 K accompanied with a cusp-like anomaly in the\nmetallic resistivity. Here, we studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure on\nits electrical transport properties up to 12.5 GPa by using a cubic anvil cell\napparatus. We find that TN determined from the resistivity anomaly first\nincreases slightly with pressure and then decreases until vanished completely\nat ~7 GPa. Intriguingly, its resistivity rho(T) is enhanced gradually by\npressure, and evolves from metallic to activated behavior as the AF order is\nsuppressed. From the Hall resistivity measurements, we confirm that the n-type\ncarriers dominate the transport properties and the carrier density is raised by\npressure. In addition, the critical magnetic field Hc1 ~3.3 T at 0 GPa for the\nspin-flop transition to the canted AF state is found to increase to ~ 5 T and\n7.5 T at 1 and 3 GPa. High-pressure XRD evidenced no structural transition up\nto 12.8 GPa. Based on the Hall resistivity results and first-principles\ncalculations, we proposed that the intralayer direct AF interactions are\nstrengthened by pressure and the competition between AF and FM interactions not\nonly prevents long-range magnetic order but also promotes charge carrier\nlocalizations through enhance magnetic fluctuations at high pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 06:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

An exact algorithm that runs in polynomial time in the number\nof agents and goods was given by Orlin.\n  In the case of chores, the competitive rule does not solve any convex\noptimization problem; instead, competitive allocations correspond to local\nminima, local maxima, and saddle points of the Nash Social Welfare on the\nPareto frontier of the set of feasible utilities.

Given the low horizontal confinement of the\ninterferometer, the atoms can be made to spread out thus yielding a 2D sheet,\nwhich could be used in a direct imaging interferometer. This interferometer can\nbe sensitive to spatially varying electric or magnetic fields, which could be\nDC, AC, RF fields or microwaves, or even local variations in gravity. We\ndemonstrate that the trap-matching afforded by the independent control of the\nshell traps allows long coherence times which will result in highly sensitive\nimaging matterwave interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 07:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

This\npaper investigates the effectiveness of the use of Binary Decision Diagrams\n(BDDs) for constraint handling. BDDs are a data structure used to represent and\nmanipulate Boolean functions. The core role of a constraint handler is to\nperform a check to determine if a partial test case with unspecified parameter\nvalues satisfies the constraints. In the course of generating a test suite,\nthis check is executed a number of times; thus the efficiency of the check\nsignificantly affects the overall time required for test case generation. In\nthe paper, we study two different approaches. The first approach performs this\ncheck by computing the logical AND of Boolean functions that represent all\nconstraint-satisfying full test cases and a given partial test case. The second\napproach uses a new technique to construct a BDD that represents all\nconstraint-satisfying partial test cases. With this BDD, the check can be\nperformed by simply traversing the BDD from the root to a sink. We developed a\nprogram that incorporates both approaches into IPOG, a well-known test case\ngeneration algorithm. Using this program, we empirically evaluate the\nperformance of these BDD-based constraint handling approaches using a total of\n62 problem instances. In the evaluation, the two approaches are compared with\nthree different constraint handling approaches, namely, those based on Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT) solving, Minimum Forbidden Tuples (MFTs), and Constraint\nSatisfiction Problem (CSP) solving. The results of the evaluation show that the\ntwo BDD-based approaches usually outperform the other constraint handling\ntechniques and that the BDD-based approach using the new technique exhibits\nbest performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 07:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

In the fields of biology\nand chemistry, this is particularly important because some of the essential\nmolecules in life such as amino acids and DNA have chirality. It is a\nlong-standing mystery how one of the enantiomers was chosen at the beginning\nstage of life. The understanding of the emergence of homochirality under some\nconditions is indispensable for the study of the origin of life as well as\npharmaceutical science. The chirality is also emergent in magnetic structures.\nThe longitudinal helical magnetic structure is the chiral object composed of\nmagnetic moments, in which the ordered direction of the magnetic moment\nspatially rotates in the plane perpendicular to the propagation vector (Fig.\n1a). Since the sense of rotation, which is denoted as helicity, is reversed by\nany mirror operation, it is corresponding to the chirality. Here we show that\nthe chirality of a longitudinal helical structure can be controlled by the\nmagnetic field and electric current owing to the spin-transfer torque\nirrelevant to the spin-orbit interaction and probed by electrical magnetochiral\neffect, which is sensitive to the chiral symmetry breaking, in an itinerant\nhelimagnet MnP. This phenomenon is distinct from the multiferroicity in\ntransverse-type insulating helical magnets, in which the helical plane is\nparallel to the propagation vector, because the magnetic structure has polar\nsymmetry not chiral one. While the combination of the magnetic field and\nelectric current satisfies the symmetrical rule of external stimulus for the\nchirality control, the control with them was not reported for any chiral object\npreviously. The present result may pave a new route to the control of\nchiralities originating from magnetic and atomical arrangements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 08:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

We demonstrate that this is\ncrucial for improving the confidence of models' ranking. Incorporating the\none-shot supernet trained under the proposed fairness constraints with a\nmulti-objective evolutionary search algorithm, we obtain various\nstate-of-the-art models, e.g., FairNAS-A attains 77.5% top-1 validation\naccuracy on ImageNet.

An individualized assessment of its shape\nis essential for clinical applications related to tonotopy and cochlear\nimplantation. To unambiguously reference morphological parameters, reliable\nrecognition of the cochlear modiolar axis in computed tomography (CT) images is\nrequired. The conventional method introduces measurement uncertainties, as it\nis based on manually selected and difficult to identify landmarks. Herein, we\npresent an algorithm for robust modiolar axis detection in clinical CT images.\nWe define the modiolar axis as the rotation component of the kinematic spiral\nmotion inherent in the cochlear shape. For surface fitting, we use a compact\nshape representation in a 7-dimensional kinematic parameter space based on\nextended Pl\\\"ucker coordinates. It is the first time such a kinematic\nrepresentation is used for shape analysis in medical images. Robust surface\nfitting is achieved with an adapted approximate maximum likelihood method\nassuming a Student-t distribution, enabling axis detection even in partially\navailable surface data. We verify the algorithm performance on a synthetic data\nset with cochlear surface subsets. In addition, we perform an experimental\nstudy with four experts in 23 human cochlea CT data sets to compare the\nautomated detection with the manually found axes. Axes found from co-registered\nhigh resolution micro-CT scans are used for reference. Our experiments show\nthat the algorithm reduces the alignment error providing more reliable modiolar\naxis detection for clinical and research applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 12:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

To that end, this paper aims to study the pros and cons of\ndifferent data management methods regarding the performance of distributed\nGBDT. We first introduce a quadrant categorization of data management policies\nbased on data partitioning and data storage.

Firstly, as an informal hierarchy where leaders and followers are\nimplicitly defined by their personal characteristics, and secondly, as an\ninstitutional hierarchy where leaders and followers are explicitly appointed by\ngroup decision. Although both forms can reduce the time spent in organising\ncollective tasks, institutional hierarchy imposes additional costs. It is\ntherefore natural to question why it emerges at all. The key difference lies in\nthe fact that institutions can create hierarchy with only a single leader,\nwhich is unlikely to occur in unregulated informal hierarchy. To investigate if\nthis difference can affect group decision-making and explain the evolution of\ninstitutional hierarchy, we first build an opinion-formation model that\nsimulates group decision making. We show that in comparison to informal\nhierarchy, a single-leader hierarchy reduces (i) the time a group spends to\nreach consensus, (ii) the variation in consensus time, and (iii) the rate of\nincrease in consensus time as group size increases. We then use this model to\nsimulate the cost of organising a collective action which produces resources,\nand integrate this into an evolutionary model where individuals can choose\nbetween informal or institutional hierarchy. Our results demonstrate that\ngroups evolve preferences towards institutional hierarchy, despite the cost of\ncreating an institution, as it provides a greater organisational advantage\nwhich is less affected by group size and inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 13:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

One common way to tackle\nthis complexity during development is to encapsulate features into a shared\nlibrary. This allows developers to reuse already implemented features instead\nof reimplementing them over and over again. However, not all features provided\nby a shared library are actually used by an application. As a result, an\napplication using shared libraries loads unused code into memory, which an\nattacker can use to perform code-reuse and similar types of attacks. The same\nholds for applications written in a scripting language such as PHP or Ruby: The\ninterpreter typically offers much more functionality than is actually required\nby the application and hence provides a larger overall attack surface.\n  In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose a first step towards\nautomated application-specific software stacks.

Our evaluation against\na diverse set of real-world applications, among others Nginx, Lighttpd, and the\nPHP interpreter, removes on average 71.3% of the code in musl-libc, a popular\nlibc implementation. The evaluation on web applications show that a tailored\nPHP interpreter can mitigate entire vulnerability classes, as is the case for\nOpenConf. We demonstrate the applicability of our debloating approach by\ncreating an application-specific software stack for a Wordpress web\napplication: we tailor the libc library to the Nginx web server and PHP\ninterpreter, whereas the PHP interpreter is tailored to the Wordpress web\napplication. In this real-world scenario, the code of the libc is decreased by\n65.1% in total, thereby reducing the available code for code-reuse attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 13:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 08:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 07:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

Most IV analyses use naturally occurring\ninstruments, such as distance to a hospital. In these analyses, investigators\nmust assume the instrument is as-if randomly assigned. This assumption cannot\nbe tested directly, but it can be falsified. Most falsification tests in the\nliterature compare relative prevalence or bias in observed covariates between\nthe instrument and the exposure. These tests require investigators to make a\ncovariate-by-covariate judgment about the validity of the IV design. Often,\nonly some of the covariates are well-balanced, making it unclear if as-if\nrandomization can be assumed for the instrument across all covariates. We\npropose an alternative falsification test that compares IV balance or bias to\nthe balance or bias that would have been produced under randomization. A key\nadvantage of our test is that it allows for global balance measures as well as\neasily interpretable graphical comparisons. Furthermore, our test does not rely\non any parametric assumptions and can be used to validly assess if the\ninstrument is significantly closer to being as-if randomized than the exposure.\nWe demonstrate our approach on a recent IV application that uses bed\navailability in the intensive care unit (ICU) as an instrument for admission to\nthe ICU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 13:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

We aim to investigate and characterise the photoionised X-ray emission\nline regions within NGC 7469. Methods. We apply the photoionisation model,\nPION, within the spectral fitting code SPEX to analyse the 640 ks RGS spectrum\nof NGC 7469 gathered during an XMM-Newton observing campaign in 2015. Results.\nWe find the emission line region in NGC 7469 to be multiphased, consisting of\ntwo narrow components with ionisation parameters of $\\log \\xi = 0.4$ and 1.6. A\nthird, broad emission component, with a broadening velocity of $v_b \\sim 1400$\nkm s\\textsuperscript{-1} and an outflow velocity of $v_{out} \\sim -4500$ km\ns\\textsuperscript{-1}, is required to fit the residuals in the O VII triplet,\nat around 22 \\AA.

When one forces a more-than-two-block structure by\nvariable-splitting, the convergence speed slows down greatly as observed in\npractice. Recently, a randomly assembled cyclic multi-block ADMM (RAC-MBADMM)\nwas developed by the authors for solving general convex and nonconvex quadratic\noptimization problems where the number of blocks can go greater than two so\nthat each sub-problem has a smaller size and can be solved much more\nefficiently. In this paper, we apply this method to solving few selected\nmachine learning problems related to convex quadratic optimization, such as\nLinear Regression, LASSO, Elastic-Net, and SVM.

In this paper,\nwe present an exploration of the origin of multi-band activities for a\nhigh-redshift (z =1.8385) FSRQ PKS 1502+106. Utilizing multi-band data from\nradio to $\\gamma$-ray and optical polarization observations, we investigate two\ndramatic activities in detail: a $\\gamma$-ray dominated outburst in 2015 and an\noptical dominated outburst in 2017. Our main results are as follows. (I) A fast\n$\\gamma$-ray flare with a flux-doubling time-scale as short as 1-hr in 2015 is\ndiscovered. Based on the variability time-scale, the physical parameters of the\nflaring region (e.g, minimum Doppler factor, emission region size, etc.) are\nconstrained. At the peak of the flare, the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum hardens to\n$\\Gamma_{\\gamma} = 1.82\\pm0.04$ and exhibits an obvious curvature/break\ncharacteristic that is caused by the typical \"cooling break\". Modelings of\nmulti-band SEDs reveal a very hard electronic energy spectrum with the\nelectronic spectral index of $1.07\\pm0.53$. This result suggests that this fast\n$\\gamma$-ray flare may be triggered by magnetic reconnection. (II) During the\noutburst in 2017, the optical polarization degree and optical fluxes show a\nvery tight correlation. By analyzing Stokes parameters of polarization\nobservations, our results show that this outburst could be triggered by a\ntransverse shock with a compression ratio of $\\eta> 2.2$, and the magnetic\nfield intensity of the shock emission region is about $0.032$ G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 15:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

This work presents two\ndifferent methods: (1) a game theoretical approach based on Shapley value which\ncomputes the marginal contribution of each filter; and (2) a probabilistic\napproach based on what-we-call, the Importance switch using variational\ninference. Strikingly, these two vastly different methods produce similar\nexperimental results, confirming the general theory that some of the filters\nare inherently more important that the others. The learned ranks can be readily\nuseable for network compression and interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 15:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 21:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

However, so far the\nexistence of PBHs is still not confirmed, and currently running GW detectors\nare still not able to distinguish them from the normal astrophysical BHs. In\nthis article, we propose that the GWs (of PBH binary mergers) could interact\nwith the very widespread background galactic magnetic fields in the Milky way,\nto produce the perturbed electromagnetic waves (EMWs) with unique\ncharacteristics of frequencies, waveforms, spectra and polarizations. In order\nto be distinguished from astrophysical black holes, only the PBHs with masses\nless than the solarmass are considered here, and their binary mergers will\nradiate GWs in frequencies much higher above the plasma frequency of\ninterstellar medium (ISM), so corresponding perturbed EMWs (in the same\nfrequencies to such GWs) can propagate through the ISM until the Earth. Our\nestimations show that, for the sub-solar mass PBH binary mergers within the\nMilky way (disk or halo), the strengths of the perturbed EMWs turn into\nconstant levels around 10^{-12} Tesla (for magnetic components) and around\n10^{-10}Watt m^{-2} (for energy flux densities) at the Earth, generally for all\ncases of different PBH masses (and not dependent on the distance of sources),\nand the same mass ratio of the PBH binary gives the same strength (at the\nEarth) of perturbed EMWs despite different PBH masses (GW frequencies) or\nbinary distances. Differently, for the PBH binary mergers outside the Milky\nway, the perturbed EMWs at Earth have lower strengths (and depend on the\ndistance of sources), but for some part of distance range, they would also be\ndetectable.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern\nindicates that nanotubes are graphitic in nature and there is no trace of\ncarbide phases in both the cases. Low frequency Raman analysis of the\nbamboo-like and filled CNTs confirms the presence of radial breathing modes\n(RBM). The degree of graphitization of CNTs synthesized from Fe catalyst is\nhigher than that from Ni catalyst as demonstrated by the high frequency Raman\nanalysis.

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring, aims to separate\nthe energy consumption of individual appliances from the readings of a mains\npower meter measuring the total energy consumption of, e.g. a whole house.\nEnergy consumption of individual appliances can be useful in many applications,\ne.g., providing appliance-level feedback to the end users to help them\nunderstand their energy consumption and ultimately save energy. Recently, with\nthe availability of large-scale energy consumption datasets, various neural\nnetwork models such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural\nnetworks have been investigated to solve the energy disaggregation problem.\nNeural network models can learn complex patterns from large amounts of data and\nhave been shown to outperform the traditional machine learning methods such as\nvariants of hidden Markov models. However, current neural network methods for\nenergy disaggregation are either computational expensive or are not capable of\nhandling long-term dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the application\nof the recently developed WaveNet models for the task of energy disaggregation.\nBased on a real-world energy dataset collected from 20 households over two\nyears, we show that WaveNet models outperforms the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning methods proposed in the literature for energy disaggregation in terms\nof both error measures and computational cost. On the basis of energy\ndisaggregation, we then investigate the performance of two deep-learning based\nframeworks for the task of on/off detection which aims at estimating whether an\nappliance is in operation or not. Based on the same dataset, we show that for\nthe task of on/off detection the second framework, i.e., directly training a\nbinary classifier, achieves better performance in terms of F1 score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 02:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 09:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

The $CTS$ compound was\nprepared in a one-step process using a novel chemical procedure consisting of\nsimultaneous precipitation of $Cu_2S$ and $SnS_2$ performed by diffusion\nmembranes assisted $CBD$ (chemical bath deposition) technique. Diffusion\nmembranes were used to optimize the kinetic growth through a moderate control\nof release of metal ions into the work solution. As the conditions for the\nformation in one step of the $Cu_2SnS_3$ compound have not yet been reported in\nliterature, special emphasis was put on finding the parameters that allow\ngrowing the $Cu_2SnS_3$ thin films by simultaneous precipitation of $Cu_2S$ and\n$SnS_2$. For that, we propose a methodology that includes numerical solution of\nthe equilibrium equations that were established through a study of the chemical\nequilibrium of the system $SnCl_2$, $Na_3C_6H_5O_7\\cdot 2H2O$, $CuCl_2$ and\n$Na_2S_2O_3\\cdot5H_2O$. The formation of thin films of $CTS$ and $CZTS$ free of\nsecondary phases grown with a stoichiometry close to that corresponding to the\n$Cu_2SnS_3$ and $Cu_2ZnSnS_4$ phases, was verified through measurements of\nX-ray diffraction $(XRD)$ and Raman spectroscopy.
