The\ncomputational problem of finding such a partition lies in the complexity class\n$\\mathrm{PPAD} \\cap \\mathrm{PLS}$, but no hardness results are known.\nTverberg's theorem also has a colorful variant: the points in $P$ have colors,\nand under certain conditions, $P$ can be partitioned into colorful sets, i.e.,\nsets in which each color appears exactly once such that the convex hulls of the\nsets intersect.\n  Recently, Adiprasito, Barany, and Mustafa [SODA 2019] proved a no-dimensional\nversion of Tverberg's theorem, in which the convex hulls of the sets in the\npartition may intersect in an approximate fashion, relaxing the requirement on\nthe cardinality of $P$.

The established field of survival analysis\nprovides a convenient statistical framework for time-to-event (i.e.\ntime-to-disruption) studies. This paper demonstrates the integration of an\nexisting disruption prediction machine learning algorithm with the Kaplan-Meier\nestimator of survival probability. Specifically discussed are the implied\nwarning times from binary classification of disruption databases and the\ninterpretation of output signals from Random Forest algorithms trained and\ntested on these databases. This survival analysis approach is applied to both\nsmooth and noisy test data to highlight important features of the survival and\nhazard functions.

In one case, both techniques successfully predict the disruption;\nalthough, in another, neither warns of the impending disruption with enough\ntime to mitigate. For the final discharge, the survival analysis approach could\navoid the false alarm triggered by the threshold method.

One potential solution to such problem, is to provide the UAV with\npower supply through a tether that connects the UAV to the ground. In this\npaper, we study the optimal placement of tethered UAVs (TUAVs) to minimize the\naverage path-loss between the TUAV and a receiver located on the ground. Given\nthat the tether has a maximum length, and the launching point of the TUAV (the\nstarting point of the tether) is placed on a rooftop, the TUAV is only allowed\nto hover within a specific hovering region. Beside the maximum tether length,\nthis hovering region also depends on the heights of the buildings surrounding\nthe rooftop, which requires the inclination angle of the tether not to be below\na given minimum value, in order to avoid tangling and ensure safety. We first\nformulate the optimization problem for such setup and provide some useful\ninsights on its solution. Next, we derive upper and lower bounds for the\noptimal values of the tether length and inclination angle. We also propose a\nsuboptimal closed-form solution for the tether length and its inclination angle\nthat is based on maximizing the line-of-sight probability. Finally, we derive\nthe probability distribution of the minimum inclination angle of the tether\nlength. We show that its mean value varies depending on the environment from 10\ndegrees in suburban environments to 31 degrees in high rise urban environments.\nOur numerical results show that the derived upper and lower bounds on the\noptimal values of the tether length and inclination angle lead to tight\nsuboptimal values of the average path-loss that are only 0-3 dBs above the\nminimum value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 17:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

After circularization, the BH's orbit decays on a longer timescale\nthan if the host cluster was not rotating. Hence BHs in rotating clusters will\nhave longer orbital decay times.

To understand UV bursts, we study how motions of\nmagnetic elements at the surface can drive the self-consistent formation of a\ncurrent sheet resulting in plasmoid-mediated reconnection. In particular, we\nwant to study the role of the height of the reconnection in the atmosphere. We\nconducted numerical experiments solving the 2D MHD equations from the solar\nsurface to the upper atmosphere. Motivated by observations, we drove a small\nmagnetic patch embedded in a larger system of magnetic field of opposite\npolarity. This configuration creates an X-type neutral point in the initial\npotential field. The models are characterized by the plasma-beta at the height\nof this X point. The driving at the surface stretches the X-point into a\ncurrent sheet, where plasmoids appear, and a bi-directional jet forms.

The properties of the\nCGM, which are dependent on a variety of internal and environmental factors,\nare often inferred from absorption line surveys which rely on a limited number\nof single lines-of-sight. In this work we present an analysis of 28 galaxy\nhaloes selected from the Auriga project, a cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical\nzoom-in simulation suite of isolated Milky Way-mass galaxies, to understand the\nimpact of CGM diversity on observational studies. Although the Auriga haloes\nare selected to populate a narrow range in halo mass, our work demonstrates\nthat the CGM of L* galaxies is extremely diverse: column densities of commonly\nobserved species span ~3-4 dex and their covering fractions range from ~5 to 90\nper cent. Despite this diversity, we identify the following correlations: 1)\nthe covering fractions (CF) of hydrogen and metals of the Auriga haloes\npositively correlate with stellar mass, 2) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II\nanticorrelate with active galactic nucleus luminosity due to ionization\neffects, and 3) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II positively correlate with galaxy\ndisc fraction due to outflows populating the CGM with cool and dense gas. The\nAuriga sample demonstrates striking diversity within the CGM of L* galaxies,\nwhich poses a challenge for observations reconstructing CGM characteristics\nfrom limited samples, and also indicates that long-term merger assembly history\nand recent star formation are not the dominant sculptors of the CGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

Our results suggest that\nthe local SF at all radii is established by some universal mechanism partially\nmodulated by morphology. Morphology seems to be connected to the slow aging and\nsharp decline of the SF process, and on its own it may depend on other\nproperties as the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 19:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

It is known that\ncomputing the exact Hamming distance between a pattern and a streaming text\nrequires $\\Omega(n)$ space (folklore). Therefore, to develop sublinear-space\nsolutions, one must relax their requirements. One possibility to do so is to\ncompute only the distances bounded by a threshold $k$, see~[SODA'19, Clifford,\nKociumaka, Porat] and references therein. The motivation for this variant of\nthis problem is that we are interested in subwords of the text that are similar\nto the pattern, i.e. in subwords such that the distance between them and the\npattern is relatively small. On the other hand, the main application of the\nstreaming setting is processing large-scale data, such as biological data.\nRecent advances in hardware technology allow generating such data at a very\nhigh speed, but unfortunately, the produced data may contain about 10\\% of\nnoise~[Biol. Direct.'07, Klebanov and Yakovlev]. To analyse such data, it is\nnot sufficient to consider small distances only. A possible workaround for this\nissue is the $(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$-approximation. This line of research was\ninitiated in [ICALP'16, Clifford and Starikovskaya] who gave a\n$(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with\nspace~$\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-5}\\sqrt{n})$. In this work, we show a suite of\nnew streaming algorithms for computing the Hamming, $L_1$, $L_2$ and general\n$L_p$ ($0 < p < 2$) distances between the pattern and the text. Our results\nsignificantly extend over the previous result in this setting. In particular,\nfor the Hamming distance and for the $L_p$ distance when $0 < p \\le 1$ we show\na streaming algorithm that uses $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\sqrt{n})$ space for\npolynomial-size alphabets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 20:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 12:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 12:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

More recently, some of these lines\nof research have started to converge in complementary ways. One success story\nis the combination of SAT solvers and CASs (SAT+CAS) aimed at resolving\nmathematical conjectures.\n  Many conjectures in pure and applied mathematics are not amenable to\ntraditional proof methods. Instead, they are best addressed via computational\nmethods that involve very large combinatorial search spaces. SAT solvers are\npowerful methods to search through such large combinatorial\nspaces---consequently, many problems from a variety of mathematical domains\nhave been reduced to SAT in an attempt to resolve them. However, solvers\ntraditionally lack deep repositories of mathematical domain knowledge that can\nbe crucial to pruning such large search spaces. By contrast, CASs are deep\nrepositories of mathematical knowledge but lack efficient general search\ncapabilities. By combining the search power of SAT with the deep mathematical\nknowledge in CASs we can solve many problems in mathematics that no other known\nmethods seem capable of solving.\n  We demonstrate the success of the SAT+CAS paradigm by highlighting many\nconjectures that have been disproven, verified, or partially verified using our\ntool MathCheck. These successes indicate that the paradigm is positioned to\nbecome a standard method for solving problems requiring both a significant\namount of search and deep mathematical reasoning.

In PSC the input consists of an integer $k$ and a set system\n$(U,S)$ where $U$ is a finite set, and $S \\subseteq 2^U$ is a collection of\nsubsets of $U$. The goal is to find a subcollection $S' \\subseteq S$ of\nsmallest cardinality such that sets in $S'$ cover at least $k$ elements of $U$;\nthat is $|\\cup_{A \\in S'} A| \\ge k$. SC is a special case of PSC when $k =\n|U|$. In the weighted version each set $X \\in S$ has a non-negative weight\n$w(X)$ and the goal is to find a minimum weight subcollection to cover $k$\nelements. Approximation algorithms for SC have been adapted to obtain\ncomparable algorithms for PSC in various interesting cases. In recent work\nInamdar and Varadarajan, motivated by geometric set systems, obtained a simple\nand elegant approach to reduce PSC to SC via the natural LP relaxation.

The conventional approach to circumvent this\nlimitation has been to search for new materials with more favorable dielectric\nproperties (e.g., reduced loss), or to incorporate gain media to overcome the\ninherent loss. In this study, however, we turn our attention to the source and\nshow that, by imposing temporal decay on the excitation, SPP modes with\nsimultaneous complex frequencies and complex wave vectors can be excited with\nenhanced resolution and propagation length. Therefore, to understand the\nunderlying physics of these phenomena and, in turn, to be able to tune them for\nspecific applications, we propose a framework of pseudo-monochromatic modes\nthat are generated by introducing exponential decays into otherwise\nmonochromatic sources. Within this framework, the dispersion relation of\ncomplex SPPs is re-evaluated and cast to be a surface rather than a curve,\ndepicting all possible $\\omega-k$ pairs (both complex in general) that are\nsupported by the given geometry. Since the improvement in resolution and\npropagation length due to the introduction of temporal decay to the excitation\nis rather counter-intuitive (i.e., adding temporal loss improves the\npropagation length), the dispersion-based theoretical predictions have been\nvalidated via the FDTD simulations of Maxwell's equations in the same geometry\nwithout any a priori assumptions on the frequency or the wave vector. Moreover,\nimprovement in resolution with the temporal decay has been demonstrated in a\nplasmonic superlens structure to further validate the predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 21:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

Modern space telescopes are currently providing high-precision light\ncurves for a large fraction of the sky, such that many new variable stars are\nbeing discovered. However, some stars have periodic variability with periods of\norder minutes and require high-cadence photometry to probe the physical\nmechanisms responsible. A cadence of less than a minute is often required to\nremove Nyquist ambiguities and confirm rapid variability which forces observers\nto obtain high-cadence ground-based photometry. Aims. We aim to provide a\nmodern software package to reduce ground-based photometric time series data and\ndeliver optimised (differential) light curves. To produce high-quality light\ncurves, which maximise the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of short-period\nvariability in a Fourier spectrum, we require adaptive elliptical aperture\nphotometry as this represents a significant advantage compared to aperture\nphotometry using circular apertures of fixed radii.

In this work,\nwe consider the off-grid problem for mmWave communications, which has a\nsignificant impact on basic network functionalities involving beam steering and\ntracking.

The participants do not need to send their encoded states to\nothers, and the protocol is therefore congenitally free from Trojan horse\nattacks. In addition, our protocol can be made secure against loss errors,\nbecause the entanglement distribution occurs only once at the beginning of our\nprotocol. We show that our protocol is secure against attacks by the\nparticipants as well as the outsiders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 22:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

These\nexperiments confirm the significant slowdown observed in past literature of\nsettling and rising particles and droplets in stratification, and are the first\nexperiments to study single liquid droplets as opposed to solid particles. By\ntracking the motion of the droplets as they rise through a stratified fluid, we\nidentify two timescales which quantitatively describe this slowdown: an\nentrainment timescale, and a retention timescale. The entrainment timescale is\na measure of the time that a droplet spends below its upper-layer terminal\nvelocity and relates to the length of time over which the droplet's rise is\naffected by entrained dense fluid. The retention time is a measure of the time\nthat the droplet is delayed from reaching an upper threshold far from the\ndensity transition. Both timescales are found to depend on the Froude and\nReynolds numbers of the system, Fr $=U_u/(Nd)$ and Re $=\\rho_u U_u d/\\nu$. We\nfind that both timescales are only significantly large for Fr $\\lesssim1$,\nindicating that trapping dynamics in a relatively sharp stratification arise\nfrom a balance between drop inertia and buoyancy. Finally, we present a\ntheoretical formulation for the drag enhancement $\\Gamma$, the ratio between\nthe maximum stratification force and the corresponding drag force on the\ndroplet, based on a simple force balance at the point of the velocity minimum.\nUsing our experimental data, we find that our formulation compares well with\nrecent theoretical and computational work by Zhang et al.

Among typical\nuse-cases of URLLC services are tele-operation, immersive virtual reality,\ncooperative automated driving, and so on. In such URLLC services, new kinds of\ntraffic such as haptic information including kinesthetic information and\ntactile information need to be delivered in addition to high-quality video and\naudio traffic in traditional multimedia services. Further, such a variety of\ntraffic has various characteristics in terms of packet sizes and data rates\nwith a variety of requirements of latency and reliability. Furthermore, some\ntraffic may occur in a sporadic manner but require reliable delivery of packets\nof medium to large sizes within a low latency, which is not supported by\ncurrent state-of-the-art wireless communication systems and is very challenging\nfor future wireless communication systems. Thus, to meet such a variety of\ntight traffic requirements in a wireless communication system, novel\ntechnologies from the physical layer to the network layer need to be devised.\nIn this paper, some novel physical layer technologies such as waveform\nmultiplexing, multiple access scheme, channel code design, synchronization, and\nfull-duplex transmission for spectrally-efficient URLLC are introduced. In\naddition, a novel performance evaluation approach, which combines a ray-tracing\ntool and system-level simulation, is suggested for evaluating the performance\nof the proposed schemes. Simulation results show the feasibility of the\nproposed schemes providing realistic URLLC services in realistic geographical\nenvironments, which encourages further efforts to substantiate the proposed\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 01:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

Existing researches generally\nfocus on coarse-grained cross-media retrieval. When users submit an image of\n\"Slaty-backed Gull\" as a query, coarse-grained cross-media retrieval treats it\nas \"Bird\", so that users can only get the results of \"Bird\", which may include\nother bird species with similar appearance (image and video), descriptions\n(text) or sounds (audio), such as \"Herring Gull\". Such coarse-grained\ncross-media retrieval is not consistent with human lifestyle, where we\ngenerally have the fine-grained requirement of returning the exactly relevant\nresults of \"Slaty-backed Gull\" instead of \"Herring Gull\". However, few\nresearches focus on fine-grained cross-media retrieval, which is a highly\nchallenging and practical task. Therefore, in this paper, we first construct a\nnew benchmark for fine-grained cross-media retrieval, which consists of 200\nfine-grained subcategories of the \"Bird\", and contains 4 media types, including\nimage, text, video and audio. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first\nbenchmark with 4 media types for fine-grained cross-media retrieval. Then, we\npropose a uniform deep model, namely FGCrossNet, which simultaneously learns 4\ntypes of media without discriminative treatments. We jointly consider three\nconstraints for better common representation learning: classification\nconstraint ensures the learning of discriminative features, center constraint\nensures the compactness characteristic of the features of the same subcategory,\nand ranking constraint ensures the sparsity characteristic of the features of\ndifferent subcategories. Extensive experiments verify the usefulness of the new\nbenchmark and the effectiveness of our FGCrossNet.

Using that model for multivariate oscillations, we construct a\nvariational optimization problem that aims to extract an ensemble of\nband-limited modes containing inherent multivariate modulated oscillations\npresent in multivariate input signal. The cost function to be minimized is the\nsum of bandwidths of all signal modes across all input data channels, which is\na generic extension of the cost function used in standard VMD to multivariate\ndata. Minimization of the resulting variational model is achieved through the\nalternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach.

We train the networks of the proposed model to\nproduce a future trajectory, which is the closest to the true trajectory, while\nmaximizing a reward from a reward function. The reward function is also trained\nat the same time to maximize the margin between the rewards from the\nground-truth trajectory and its estimate. The reward function plays the role of\na regularizer for the proposed model so the trained networks are able to better\nutilize the scene context information for the prediction task. We evaluated the\nproposed model on several public datasets. Experimental results show that the\nprediction performance of the proposed model is much improved by the\nregularization, which outperforms the-state-of-the-arts in terms of accuracy.\nThe implementation codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/d1024choi/traj-pred-irl/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 06:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Such\ntechnology becomes especially pivotal under situations with limited\ninfrastructures and computational resources, such as voice command recognition\nin vehicles and robot interaction. At present, the mainstream methods in\nautomatic speech keyword recognition are based on long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks with attention mechanism. However, due to inevitable information\nlosses for the LSTM layer caused during feature extraction, the calculated\nattention weights are biased. In this paper, a novel approach, namely\nMulti-layer Attention Mechanism, is proposed to handle the inaccurate attention\nweights problem. The key idea is that, in addition to the conventional\nattention mechanism, information of layers prior to feature extraction and LSTM\nare introduced into attention weights calculations. Therefore, the attention\nweights are more accurate because the overall model can have more precise and\nfocused areas. We conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis on the\nkeyword spotting performances on convolution neural network, bi-directional\nLSTM cyclic neural network, and cyclic neural network with the proposed\nattention mechanism on Google Speech Command datasets V2 datasets.

However, constructing optimal\n$n$-qubit codeword stabilized codes is made difficult by two main factors. The\nfirst of these is the exponential growth with $n$ of the number of graphs on\nwhich a code can be based. The second is the NP-hardness of the maximum clique\nsearch required to construct a code from a given graph. We address the second\nof these issues through the use of a heuristic clique finding algorithm. This\napproach has allowed us to find $((9,97\\leq K\\leq100,2))$ and $((11,387\\leq\nK\\leq416,2))$ codes, which are larger than any previously known codes. To\naddress the exponential growth of the search space, we demonstrate that graphs\nthat give large codes typically yield clique graphs with a large number of\nnodes.

Our model takes into account\nradiative forcings from the main hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, acetylene),\nammonia, collision-induced absorption, four cloud and haze layers (including a\nUV-absorbing \"polar\" stratospheric haze) and an internal heat flux. We detail\nsensitivity studies of the equilibrium temperature profile to several\nparameters. We discuss the expected seasonal, vertical and meridional thermal\nstructure and compare it to that derived from Cassini and ground-based thermal\ninfrared observations. We find that the equilibrium temperature in the 5-30\nmbar pressure range is very sensitive to the chosen stratospheric haze optical\nproperties, sizes and number of monomers. The polar haze can significantly warm\nthe lower stratosphere (10-30 mbar) by up to 20K at latitudes 45-60{\\deg}. At\npressures lower than 3 mbar, our modeled temperatures systematically\nunderestimate the observed ones by 5K. This might suggest that other processes,\nsuch as dynamical heating by wave breaking or by eddies, or a coupling with\nthermospheric circulation, play an important role. In the troposphere, we can\nonly match the observed lack of meridional gradient of temperature by varying\nthe internal heat flux with latitude. We then exploit knowledge of heating and\ncooling rates to diagnose the residual-mean circulation in Jupiter's\nstratosphere, under the assumption that the eddy heat flux convergence term is\nnegligible. In the lower stratosphere (5-30 mbar), the residual-mean\ncirculation strongly depends on the assumed properties of the stratospheric\nhaze.

The\nproperties of primary products in multinucleon transfer process, such as\ntransfer probabilities and primary cross sections, are extracted from TDHF\ndynamics by using the particle-number projection method.

The key insight in our analysis is that the\norder of learning different types of patterns is crucial: because the small\nlearning rate model first memorizes easy-to-generalize, hard-to-fit patterns,\nit generalizes worse on hard-to-generalize, easier-to-fit patterns than its\nlarge learning rate counterpart.

The goal\nof this problem is to distribute $m$ goods to $n$ agents in a \"fair\" manner,\nwhere every agent has a valuation for each subset of goods. We assume general\nvaluations.\n  Envy-freeness is the most extensively studied notion of fairness. However,\nenvy-free allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible. The\nnotion of fairness we consider here is \"envy-freeness up to any good\" (EFX)\nwhere no agent envies another agent after the removal of any single good from\nthe other agent's bundle.

Over the past\ndecades a significant amount of effort has been made by the researchers to\nunderstand the limits of secrecy constraints in communication networks. In this\nwork, we focus on how to remove the secrecy constraints in communication\nnetworks, i.e., how to remove the GDoF penalty due to secrecy constraints. We\nbegin with three basic settings: a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference\nchannel with confidential messages, a symmetric Gaussian wiretap channel with a\nhelper, and a two-user symmetric Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel.\nInterestingly, in this work we show that adding common randomness at the\ntransmitters can totally remove the penalty in GDoF or GDoF region of the three\nsettings considered here. The results reveal that adding common randomness at\nthe transmitters is a powerful way to remove the secrecy constraints in\ncommunication networks in terms of GDoF performance. Common randomness can be\ngenerated offline. The role of the common randomness is to jam the information\nsignal at the eavesdroppers, without causing too much interference at the\nlegitimate receivers. To accomplish this role, a new method of Markov\nchain-based interference neutralization is proposed in the achievability\nschemes utilizing common randomness. From the practical point of view, we hope\nto use less common randomness to remove secrecy constraints in terms of GDoF\nperformance. With this motivation, for most of the cases we characterize the\nminimal GDoF of common randomness to remove secrecy constraints, based on our\nderived converses and achievability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 10:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

The electron skyrmion is also always\nof infinite size. In the F phase it is always fully polarized while in the AF\nphase it undergoes continuous magnetization under increasing Zeeman energy. In\nthe case of $\\nu=0$ the skyrmion is always maximally localized in space both in\nF and AF phase. In the F phase it is fully polarized while in the AF it has\nalso progressive magnetization with Zeeman energy. The magnetization process is\nunrelated to the spatial profile of the skyrmions contrary to the SU(2) case.\nIn all cases the skyrmion physics is dominated by the competition between\nanisotropies and Zeeman effect but not directly by the Coulomb interactions,\nbreaking universal scaling with the ratio Zeeman to Coulomb energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 10:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 08:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Birth-death models of evolution are an important family of\nphylogenetic models of the diversification processes that lead to evolutionary\ntrees. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) give phylogeneticists a new\nand exciting tool: their models can be implemented as probabilistic programs\nwith just a basic knowledge of programming. The general inference methods in\nPPLs reduce the need for external experts, allow quick prototyping and testing,\nand accelerate the development and deployment of new models. We show how these\nbirth-death models can be implemented as simple programs in existing PPLs, and\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the proposed inference method for such models.\nFor the popular BiSSE model the method yields an increase of the effective\nsample size and the conditional acceptance rate by a factor of 30 in comparison\nwith a standard bootstrap particle filter. Although concentrating on\nphylogenetics, the extended APF is a general inference method that shows its\nstrength in situations where particles are often assigned zero weight.

Specifically, a spatio-temporal network is developed in a\ndifferentiable space modeled by a directed acyclic graph, thus a gradient-based\nstrategy can be performed to search an optimal architecture. Nonetheless, it is\ncomputationally expensive, since the computational burden to evaluate each\narchitecture candidate is still heavy. To alleviate this issue, we, for the\nvideo input, introduce a temporal segment approach to reduce the computational\ncost without losing global video information. For the architecture, we explore\nin an efficient search space by introducing pseudo 3D operators.

In contrast with carbon and nitrogen, oxygen does not show any\nsignificant systematic anomalies in their abundances log E(O). There is no\nmarked difference from the initial oxygen abundance within errors of the log\nE(O) determination across the Teff interval from 4500 to 8500 K and the log g\ninterval from 1.2 to 2.9 dex. This result agrees well with theoretical\npredictions for stellar models with rotation. With our new data for oxygen and\nour earlier non-LTE determinations of the N and C abundances for stars from the\nsame sample, we constructed the [N/C] vs [N/O] relation for 17 stars. This\nrelation is known to be a sensitive indicator of stellar evolution. A\npronounced correlation between [N/C] vs [N/O] is found; the observed [N/C]\nincrease from 0 to 1.6 dex is accompanied by the [N/O] increase from 0 to 0.9\ndex. When comparing the observed [N/C] vs [N/O] relation with the theoretical\none, we show that this relation reflects a strong dependence of the\nevolutionary changes in CNO abundances on the initial rotation velocities of\nstars. Given that the initial rotational velocities of these stars are expected\nto satisfy V0<150 km/s, it is found that they are mostly the post first\ndredge-up (post-FDU) objects. It is important that just such initial velocities\nV0 are typical for about 80% of stars in question (i.e. for stars with masses\n4-19 M_sun). A constancy of the total C+N+O abundance during stellar evolution\nis confirmed.

We numerically simulate the theoretical results with\napplications to a few-mode fiber and a multimode fiber, and calculate\nbend-induced modal crosstalk with implications for mode-multiplexed systems.\nThe presented perturbation technique is general enough to be applicable to\nother perturbations like ellipticity and easily extendable to other fibers with\nstep-index-like profile as in the ring fiber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 16:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

Most of this research has focused on\nallowing respondents to express their (intra) uncertainty using intervals.\nHere, depending on the technique used and types of uncertainties being modelled\ndifferent types of FSs can be obtained (e.g., Type-1, Interval Type-2, General\nType-2). Arguably, one of the most flexible techniques is the Interval\nAgreement Approach (IAA) as it allows to model the perception of all\nrespondents without making assumptions such as outlier removal or predefined\nmembership function types (e.g. Gaussian). A key aspect in the analysis of\ninterval-valued data and indeed, IAA based agreement models of said data, is to\ndetermine the position and strengths of agreement across all the\nsources/participants. While previously, the Agreement Ratio was proposed to\nmeasure the strength of agreement in fuzzy set based models of interval data,\nsaid measure has only been applicable to type-1 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we\nextend the Agreement Ratio to capture the degree of inter-group agreement\nmodelled by a General Type-2 Fuzzy Set when using the IAA.

Thermal atoms on the\nother hand, provide us with a dense emitter ensemble and in comparison to the\ncold systems are more compatible with integration, hence enabling large-scale\nquantum systems. However, their thermal motion and large transit time\nbroadening is a major challenge that has to be circumvented. A promising remedy\ncould benefit from the highly controllable and tunable electromagnetic fields\nof a nano-photonic cavity with strong local electric-field enhancements.\nUtilizing this feature, here we calculate the interaction between fast moving,\nthermal atoms and a nano-beam photonic crystal cavity (PCC) with large quality\nfactor and small mode volume.

In\nour prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting\ntechnique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In\ncontrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual\nproperties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method\nrequires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a\nconsiderable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this\npaper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations,\nbecause such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the\nbox. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we\ncannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this\nmotivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR,\nincluding configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an\nimportant robustness challenge.

In particular, train units are commonly maintained and cleaned at\ndedicated shunting yards. The planning problem that results from such\nsituations is referred to as the Train Unit Shunting Problem (TUSP). This\nproblem involves matching arriving train units to service tasks and determining\nthe schedule for departing trains. The TUSP is an important problem as it is\nused to determine the capacity of shunting yards and arises as a sub-problem of\nmore general scheduling and planning problems. In this paper, we consider the\ncase of the Dutch Railways (NS) TUSP. As the TUSP is complex, NS currently uses\na local search (LS) heuristic to determine if an instance of the TUSP has a\nfeasible solution. Given the number of shunting yards and the size of the\nplanning problems, improving the evaluation speed of the LS brings significant\ncomputational gain.

We use this model to\ndecide whether to continue or abort the search process. In this way, the\ncomputation time is used more efficiently as it is spent on instances that are\nmore likely to be feasible.

We present our results using two complementary\napproaches: in the lattice regularisation of the path integral, and in the\nfunctorial approach to area-dependent quantum field theories with defects via\nregularised Frobenius algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 11:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

The hypergraphs have a high probability of being peelable, i.e. to admit\nno sub-hypergraph of minimum degree $2$, even when the edge density (number of\nedges over vertices) is close to $1$. In our construction, the vertex set is\npartitioned into linearly arranged segments and each edge is incident to random\nvertices of $k$ consecutive segments. Quite surprisingly, the linear geometry\nallows our graphs to be peeled \"from the outside in\". The density thresholds\n$f_k$ for peelability of our hypergraphs ($f_3 \\approx 0.918$, $f_4 \\approx\n0.977$, $f_5 \\approx 0.992$, ...) are well beyond the corresponding thresholds\n($c_3 \\approx 0.818$, $c_4 \\approx 0.772$, $c_5 \\approx 0.702$, ...) of\nstandard $k$-uniform random hypergraphs.

A standard textbook solution [Thompson, CACM 1968]\nsolves this problem in $O(nm)$ time, where $n$ is the length of $Q$ and $m$ is\nthe number of characters in $R$. More recently, several results that improve\nthis bound by polylogarithmic factor have appeared. All of these solutions are\nessentially based on constructing and simulation a non-deterministic finite\nautomaton. On the other hand, assuming the strong exponential time hypotheses\nwe cannot solve regular expression $O((nm)^{1-\\epsilon})$ [Backurs and Indyk,\nFOCS 2016]. Hence, a natural question is if we can design algorithms that can\ntake advantage of other parameters of the problem to obtain more fine-grained\nbounds. We present the first algorithm for regular expression matching that can\ntake advantage of sparsity of the automaton simulation. More precisely, we\ndefine the \\emph{density}, $\\Delta$, of the instance to be the total number of\nstates in a simulation of a natural automaton for $R$. The density is always at\nmost $nm+1$ but may be significantly smaller for many typical scenarios, e.g.,\nwhen a string only matches a small part of the regular expression. Our main\nresult is a new algorithm that solves the problem in $$O\\left(\\Delta \\log \\log\n\\frac{nm}{\\Delta} + n + m\\right)$$ time. This result essentially replaces $nm$\nwith $\\Delta$ in the complexity of regular expression matching. Prior to this\nwork no non-trivial bound in terms of $\\Delta$ was known. The key technical\ncontribution is a new linear space representation of the classic position\nautomaton that supports fast state-set transition computation in near-linear\ntime in the size of the input and output state sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 06:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 07:41:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 08:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

A major methodological challenge is to find a\nsuitable parametrization for the GEV distribution when covariates or latent\nspatial effects are involved. Other challenges involve balancing model\ncomplexity and parsimony using an appropriate model selection procedure, and\nmaking inference using a reliable and computationally efficient approach. Our\napproach relies on a latent Gaussian modeling framework with a novel\nmultivariate link function designed to separate the interpretation of the\nparameters at the latent level and to avoid unreasonable estimates of the shape\nand time trend parameters. Structured additive regression models are proposed\nfor the four parameters at the latent level.

In previous work, we showed that cold gas\ncan accelerate to wind speeds and grow in mass if the radiative cooling time of\nmixed gas is shorter than the cloud destruction time. Here, we study this\nprocess in much more detail, and find remarkably robust cloud acceleration and\ngrowth in a wide variety of scenarios. Radiative cooling, rather than the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability, enables self-sustaining entrainment of hot gas\nonto the cloud via cooling-induced pressure gradients. Indeed, growth peaks\nwhen the cloud is almost co-moving. The entrainment velocity is of order the\ncold gas sound speed, and growth is accompanied by cloud pulsations. Growth is\nalso robust to the background wind and initial cloud geometry. In an adiabatic\nChevalier-Clegg type wind, for instance, the mass growth rate is constant.\nAlthough growth rates are similar with magnetic fields, cloud morphology\nchanges dramatically, with low density, magnetically supported filaments which\nhave a small mass fraction but dominate by volume. This could bias absorption\nline observations. Cloud growth from entraining and cooling hot gas can\npotentially account for the cold gas content of the CGM. It can also fuel star\nformation in the disk as cold gas recycled in a galactic fountain accretes and\ncools halo gas.

Secondly, the losses caused by\nthe trap are now greatly reduced, providing more flexibility in trap placement.\nThe latter point is of particular importance, since for efficient protection\nfrom quasiparticles, the traps ideally should be placed close to the active\nparts of the qubit device, where electric fields are typically high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

Refactoring is a critical task in software maintenance and is\ngenerally performed to enforce the best design and implementation practices or\nto cope with design defects. Several studies attempted to detect refactoring\nactivities through mining software repositories allowing to collect, analyze\nand get actionable data-driven insights about refactoring practices within\nsoftware projects. Aim. We aim at identifying, among the various quality models\npresented in the literature, the ones that are more in-line with the\ndeveloper's vision of quality optimization, when they explicitly mention that\nthey are refactoring to improve them. Method. We extract a large corpus of\ndesign-related refactoring activities that are applied and documented by\ndevelopers during their daily changes from 3,795 curated open source Java\nprojects. In particular, we extract a large-scale corpus of structural metrics\nand anti-pattern enhancement changes, from which we identify 1,245 quality\nimprovement commits with their corresponding refactoring operations, as\nperceived by software engineers. Thereafter, we empirically analyze the impact\nof these refactoring operations on a set of common state-of-the-art design\nquality metrics. Results. The statistical analysis of the obtained results\nshows that (i) a few state-of-the-art metrics are more popular than others; and\n(ii) some metrics are being more emphasized than others. Conclusions. We verify\nthat there are a variety of structural metrics that can represent the internal\nquality attributes with different degrees of improvement and degradation of\nsoftware quality. Most of the metrics that are mapped to the main quality\nattributes do capture developer intentions of quality improvement reported in\nthe commit messages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn\nan obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions,\nwhich is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during\nexecution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner,\nwhich predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of\nobstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local\nplanner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias\ntree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three\nkinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all\nthree robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art\nkinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish\ntime than a steering function free method.

The underlying mathematical structure is a new geometry\nendowed with intrinsic 2nd central moment (variance) or even higher moments of\nits coordinates, which generalizes the classical Riemannian geometry based on\nonly 1st moment (mean) of its coordinates. The 2nd central moment of the\ncoordinates directly modifies the quadratic form distance which is the\nfoundation of the Riemannian geometry. At semi-classical level, the 2nd central\nmoment introduces a flow which continuously deforms the Riemannian geometry\ndriven by its classical Ricci curvature, which is known as the Ricci flow. A\ngeneralized equivalence principle of quantum version is also proposed to\ninterpret the new geometry endowed with at least 2nd moment. As a consequence,\nthe spacetime is stabilized against quantum fluctuation, and the cosmological\nconstant problem is resolved within the framework.

This analogy is\ntrue for the policy making. Policy makers cannot establish a single policy to\nsolve all problems for all regions because each region has its own unique\nissue. In the other extreme, policy makers also cannot create a policy for each\nsmall village due to the resource limitation.

Because of the Bayesian approach, TCK can naturally deal with missing\nvalues without resorting to imputation and the ensemble strategy ensures\nrobustness to hyperparameters, making it particularly well suited for\nunsupervised learning.\n  However, TCK assumes missing at random and that the underlying missingness\nmechanism is ignorable, i.e. uninformative, an assumption that does not hold in\nmany real-world applications, such as e.g. medicine. To overcome this\nlimitation, we present a kernel capable of exploiting the potentially rich\ninformation in the missing values and patterns, as well as the information from\nthe observed data. In our approach, we create a representation of the missing\npattern, which is incorporated into mixed mode mixture models in such a way\nthat the information provided by the missing patterns is effectively exploited.\nMoreover, we also propose a semi-supervised kernel, capable of taking advantage\nof incomplete label information to learn more accurate similarities.\n  Experiments on benchmark data, as well as a real-world case study of patients\ndescribed by longitudinal electronic health record data who potentially suffer\nfrom hospital-acquired infections, demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 08:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

Yet, no\nsuch technosignatures have been found. Considering the vastness of space,\nfinding such technosignatures has been described as trying to find a needle in\na cosmic haystack. To help resolve this, two hypotheses are proposed to aid\nSETI researchers in narrowing the search for ET technosignatures, based on a\nnetwork analysis approach to locate where in space potential ET communication\nnetworks would most likely be. A potential ET communication network can use\nexoplanets as communication access points (e.g., placing a communication\nsatellite into planetary orbit, or an antenna on a planetary surface). The\napproach uses a topology where exoplanets are represented as nodes, and the\nlines of average distance (generalized communication paths) between adjacent\nexoplanets are represented as edges; the nodes and edges form local and wide\nplanetary networks. Using the approach and data visualization on exoplanet\ndatabases can highlight locations of potential ET communication networks in\nspace. The first hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely\nappear in a potentially habitable solar system containing a high concentration\nof planets, wherein the planets function as communication access points to\nfacilitate a potential ET communication network. The second hypothesis posits\nthat an ET technosignature would more likely appear in a highly concentrated\ncluster of potentially habitable solar systems.

At T_s=25oC, we observe\npinned-stage linear evaporation for pure droplets, but a binary droplet\nundergoes two distinct evaporation stages: an early pinned stage and a later\nreceding stage. In the binary droplet, the more volatile ethanol, evaporates\nfaster leading to a nonlinear trend in the evaporation process at the early\nstage. The phenomenon observed in the present study at T_s=25oC is similar to\nthat presented by previous researchers at room temperature. More interesting\ndynamics is observed in the evaporation process of a binary droplet at an\nelevated substrate temperature. We found that the lifetime of the droplet\nexhibits a non-monotonic trend with the increase in ethanol concentration in\nthe binary mixture, which {can be attributed to} the non-ideal behaviour of\nwater-ethanol binary mixtures. Increasing T_s decreases the lifetime of the\n(50\\% ethanol + 50 \\% water) binary droplet in a logarithmic scale.

This local asymmetry in the DM distribution would gravitationally\naffect the motions of Solar System planets, potentially allowing the DM wake to\nbe detected or ruled out. Hernandez (2019) recently calculated that the\nDM-induced perturbation to Saturn's position is 252 metres net of the effect on\nthe Sun. No such anomaly is seen in Saturn's motion despite very accurate\ntracking of the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn for >13 years. Here,\nwe revisit the calculation of how much Saturn would deviate from Keplerian\nmotion if we fix its position and velocity at some particular time. The DM wake\ninduces a nearly resonant perturbation whose amplitude grows almost linearly\nwith time.

Over a 100 year period, the perturbation to\nSaturn's orbit amounts to <1 cm, which is quite consistent with existing\nobservations.

Both spectral\nnudging and CDA describe better the small-scale features compared to grid\nnudging.

However, due to the different distribution of synthetic\nimages compared to real images, the desired performance cannot be achieved.\nReal images consist of multiple forms of light orientation, while synthetic\nimages consist of a uniform light orientation. These features are considered to\nbe characteristic of outdoor and indoor scenes, respectively. To solve this\nproblem, the previous method learned a model to improve the realism of the\nsynthetic image. Different from the previous methods, this paper try to purify\nreal image by extracting discriminative and robust features to convert outdoor\nreal images to indoor synthetic images. In this paper, we first introduce the\nsegmentation masks to construct RGB-mask pairs as inputs, then we design a\nattention-guided style transfer network to learn style features separately from\nthe attention and bkgd(background) region , learn content features from full\nand attention region. Moreover, we propose a novel region-level task-guided\nloss to restrain the features learnt from style and content. Experiments were\nperformed using mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) methods to\ndemonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions. We\nevaluate the proposed method on three public datasets, including LPW, COCO and\nMPIIGaze. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is\neffective and achieves the state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 04:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}
