However, these methods require repeatedly re-fitting the model with\ndifferent weighted versions of the original dataset, which can be prohibitively\ntime-consuming. For sufficiently regular optimization problems the optimum\ndepends smoothly on the data weights, and so the process of repeatedly\nre-fitting can be approximated with a Taylor series that can be often evaluated\nrelatively quickly. The first-order approximation is known as the\n\"infinitesimal jackknife\" in the statistics literature and has been the subject\nof recent interest in machine learning for approximate CV. In this work, we\nconsider high-order approximations, which we call the \"higher-order\ninfinitesimal jackknife\" (HOIJ).

Our approach leverages a careful\namortized analysis, which also allows us to derive output-sensitive bounds for\nthe running time of $O(\\min\\{m\\sqrt{m^+}, \\Delta m^+\\} \\log n)$, where $m^+$ is\nthe number of unique fill edges and original edges that the algorithm\nencounters and $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph.\n  Furthermore, we show there cannot exist an exact minimum degree algorithm\nthat runs in $O(nm^{1-\\varepsilon})$ time, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, assuming\nthe strong exponential time hypothesis. This fine-grained reduction goes\nthrough the orthogonal vectors problem and uses a new low-degree graph\nconstruction called $U$-fillers, which act as pathological inputs and cause any\nminimum degree algorithm to exhibit nearly worst-case performance. With these\ntwo results, we nearly characterize the time complexity of computing an exact\nminimum degree ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 17:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 20:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

This property requires us to carefully process\nall the pixels in an image in order to accurately localize all text instances.\nIn particular, for the more difficult task of localizing small text regions,\nmany methods use an enlarged image or even several rescaled ones as their\ninput. This significantly increases the processing time of the entire image and\nneedlessly enlarges background regions. If we were to have a prior telling us\nthe coarse location of text instances in the image and their approximate scale,\nwe could have adaptively chosen which regions to process and how to rescale\nthem, thus significantly reducing the processing time. To estimate this prior\nwe propose a segmentation-based network with an additional \"scale predictor\",\nan output channel that predicts the scale of each text segment. The network is\napplied on a scaled down image to efficiently approximate the desired prior,\nwithout processing all the pixels of the original image. The approximated prior\nis then used to create a compact image containing only text regions, resized to\na canonical scale, which is fed again to the segmentation network for\nfine-grained detection.

However, the tuning\nof the resonance frequency or impedance bandwidth results in the variation of\nthe current and field distributions. In this regard, this work adopts the\nconcept of characteristic modes to gain an initial understanding of the\nperturbation mechanism of the rectangular patch when loaded with a slot. The\nperformance of microstrip antennas with finite ground plane is then studied\nusing full-wave simulation. It has been found that the distribution of the\ninduced current density is highly dependent on the orientation of the slot The\nincorporation of a narrow slot suppresses the nearby orthogonal eigen mode and,\nas a consequence, the radiation behavior is affected. Specifically, in the\npresence of biological tissues in the near-field region, both antenna input\nimpedance properties and the realized gain are dependent on the slot\norientation.

In the\npresent digital and Big-data era, a huge volume of JPEG compressed document\nimages are being archived and communicated through consumer electronics on\ndaily basis. Though it is advantageous to have data in the compressed form on\none side, however, on the other side processing with off-the-shelf methods\nbecomes computationally expensive because it requires decompression and\nrecompression operations. Therefore, it would be novel and efficient, if the\ncompressed data are processed directly in their respective compressed domains\nof consumer electronics. In the present research paper, we propose to\ndemonstrate this idea taking the case study of printed text line segmentation.\nSince, JPEG achieves compression by dividing the image into non overlapping 8x8\nblocks in the pixel domain and using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); it is\nvery likely that the partitioned 8x8 DCT blocks overlap the contents of two\nadjacent text-lines without leaving any clue for the line separator, thus\nmaking text-line segmentation a challenging problem. Two approaches of\nsegmentation have been proposed here using the DC projection profile and AC\ncoefficients of each 8x8 DCT block.

To facilitate concurrent eavesdropping, our multi-antenna\nlegitimate monitor employs a proactive eavesdropping via jamming approach, by\nselectively jamming suspicious receivers to lower the transmission rates of the\ntarget links. In particular, we are interested in characterizing the achievable\neavesdropping rate region for the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver\ncase, by optimizing the legitimate monitor's jamming transmit covariance matrix\nsubject to its power budget. As the monitor cannot hear more than what\nsuspicious links transmit, the achievable eavesdropping rate region is\nessentially the intersection of the achievable rate region for the two\nsuspicious links and that for the two eavesdropping links. The former region\ncan be purposely altered by the monitor's jamming transmit covariance matrix,\nwhereas the latter region is fixed when the MMSE receiver is employed.\nTherefore, we first analytically characterize the achievable rate region for\nthe two suspicious links via optimizing the jamming transmit covariance matrix\nand then obtain the achievable eavesdropping rate region for the MMSE receiver\ncase.

In the case of cold atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover, only a contact\ninteraction remains, but the coupling strength $\\Delta/\\mu$ can take arbitrary\nvalues, and we study the branch at any wave number. At weak coupling, we\npredict three scales, that already mentioned $q\\approx 1/\\xi$, that\n$q\\approx(\\Delta/\\mu)^{-1/3}/\\xi$ where the real part of the dispersion\nrelation has a minimum and that $q\\approx (\\mu/\\Delta)/\\xi\\approx k_{\\rm F}$\n($k_{\\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave number) where the branch reaches the edge of its\nexistence domain.

If the digital\nprecoding is optimized by a locally optimal algorithm, we obtain a locally\noptimal alternating maximization algorithm. In contrast, if we use a weighted\nminimum mean square error (MMSE)-based iterative algorithm for digital\nprecoding, we obtain a suboptimal alternating maximization algorithm with\nreduced complexity in each iteration.

To bridge this gap, we rethink conditional methods of StarGAN-VC, which\nare key components for achieving non-parallel multi-domain VC in a single\nmodel, and propose an improved variant called StarGAN-VC2. Particularly, we\nrethink conditional methods in two aspects: training objectives and network\narchitectures.

With computer graphics, we can\ngenerate almost unlimited training data with precise annotation. However,a deep\nmodel trained with synthetic data usually cannot directly generalize well to\nrealistic images due to domain shift. It has been observed that highly\nconfident labels for the unlabeled real images may be predicted relying on the\nlabeled synthetic data. To tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation problem,\nwe explore the possibilities to generate high-quality labels as proxy labels to\nsupervise the training on target data. Specifically, we propose a novel\nproxy-based method using multi-adversarial training. We first train the model\nusing synthetic data (source domain). Multiple discriminators are used to align\nthe features be-tween the source and target domain (real images) at different\nlevels. Then we focus on obtaining and selecting high-quality proxy labels by\nincorporating both the confidence of the class predictor and that from the\nadversarial discriminators. Our discriminators not only work as a regularizer\nto encourage feature alignment but also provide an alternative confidence\nmeasure for generating proxy labels. Relying on the generated high-quality\nproxies, our model can be trained in a \"supervised manner\" on the target\ndo-main. On two major tasks, GTA5->Cityscapes and SYNTHIA->Cityscapes, our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the previous by a large\nmargin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 08:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

This\ninherently far-from-equilibrium process finds striking manifestations in the\nadaptive immune system, where highly variable antigens and a finite repertoire\nof immune receptors coevolve on comparable timescales. This unique challenge to\nthe immune system motivates general questions: How do ecological and\nevolutionary processes interplay to shape diversity? What determine the\nendurance and fate of coevolution? Here, we take the perspective of responsive\nenvironments and develop a phenotypic model of coevolution between receptors\nand antigens that both exhibit cross-reactivity (one-to-many responses). The\ntheory predicts that the extent of asymmetry in cross-reactivity is a key\ndeterminant of repertoire composition: small asymmetry supports persistent\nlarge diversity, whereas strong asymmetry yields long-lived transients of\nquasispecies in both populations. The latter represents a new type of Turing\nmechanism. More surprisingly, patterning in the trait space feeds back on\npopulation dynamics: spatial resonance between the Turing modes breaks the\ndynamic balance, leading to antigen extinction or unrestrained growth. Model\npredictions can be tested via combined genomic and phenotypic measurements. Our\nwork identifies cross-reactivity as an important regulator of diversity and\ncoevolutionary outcome, and reveals the remarkable effect of ecological\nfeedback in pattern-forming systems, which drives evolution toward non-steady\nstates different than the Red Queen persistent cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 09:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

We use the hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jet quenching that\ncombines perturbative shower evolution with an effective strongly coupled\ndescription of the energy and momentum transfer from the jet into the\nhydrodynamic quark-gluon plasma. Because of momentum conservation, the wake\ncreated by the jet enhances or depletes the amount of particles generated at\nthe freeze-out hypersurface depending on their orientation with respect to the\njet. Within such framework we find that jet suppression is surprisingly\nindependent of the anti-$k_T$ radius $R$, first slightly increasing as one\nincreases $R$, then at larger values of $R$ very slowly decreasing. This nearly\nindependence of jet suppression with increasing values of $R$ arises from two\ncompeting effects, namely the larger energy loss of the hard jet components,\nwhich tends to increase suppression, versus the partial recovery of the lost\nenergy due to medium response, reducing suppression. We also find that the\nboosted medium from the recoiling jet reduces the amount of plasma in the\ndirection opposite to it in the transverse plane, increasing the amount of jet\nsuppression due to an over-subtraction effect. We show that this characteristic\nsignature of the hydrodynamization of part of the jet energy can be quantified\nby selecting samples of dijet configurations with different relative\npseudorapidities between the leading and the subleading jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 09:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

The condition that the sliding velocity should be tangential to the bed\nis realized by imposing an impenetrability condition at the base. We study the,\nin glaciological literature used, numerical implementations of the\nimpenetrability condition for non-linear Stokes flow with Navier's slip on the\nboundary. Using the finite element method, we enforce impenetrability by: a\nlocal rotation of the coordinate system (strong method), a Lagrange multiplier\nmethod enforcing zero average flow across each facet (weak method) and an\napproximative method that uses the pressure variable as a Lagrange multiplier\nfor both incompressibility and impenetrability. An analysis of the latter shows\nthat it relaxes the incompressibility constraint, but enforces impenetrability\napproximately if the pressure is close to the normal component of the stress at\nthe bed. Comparing the methods numerically using a method of manufactured\nsolutions unexpectedly leads to similar convergence results.

In such a fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputer, noise-induced errors must be detected and corrected in real-time to\nprevent them from propagating between components. This requirement is\nespecially pertinent while applying quantum gates, when the interaction between\ncomponents can cause errors to quickly spread throughout the system. However,\nthe large overhead involved in most fault-tolerant architectures makes\nimplementing these systems a daunting task, which motivates the search for\nhardware-efficient alternatives. Here, we present a gate enacted by a\nmultilevel ancilla transmon on a cavity-encoded logical qubit that is\nfault-tolerant with respect to decoherence in both the ancilla and the encoded\nqubit. We maintain the purity of the encoded qubit in the presence of ancilla\nerrors by detecting those errors in real-time, and applying the appropriate\ncorrections. We show a reduction of the logical gate error by a factor of two\nin the presence of naturally occurring decoherence, and demonstrate resilience\nagainst ancilla bit-flips and phase-flips by observing a sixfold suppression of\nthe gate error with increased energy relaxation, and a fourfold suppression\nwith increased dephasing noise. The results demonstrate that bosonic logical\nqubits can be controlled by error-prone ancilla qubits without inheriting the\nancilla's inferior performance. As such, error-corrected ancilla-enabled gates\nare an important step towards fully fault-tolerant processing of bosonic\nqubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 10:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We use\njoinwidth to obtain polynomial-time algorithms (if a corresponding\ndecomposition is provided in the input) as well as fixed-parameter algorithms\n(if no such decomposition is provided) for solving the CSP.\n  Joinwidth is a hybrid parameter, as it takes both the graphical structure as\nwell as the constraint relations that appear in the instance into account. It\nhas, therefore, the potential to capture larger classes of tractable instances\nthan purely structural parameters like hypertree width and the more general\nfractional hypertree width (fhtw). Indeed, we show that any class of instances\nof bounded fhtw also has bounded joinwidth, and that there exist classes of\ninstances of bounded joinwidth and unbounded fhtw, so bounded joinwidth\nproperly generalizes bounded fhtw.\n  We further show that bounded joinwidth also properly generalizes several\nother known hybrid restrictions, such as fhtw with degree constraints and\nfunctional dependencies.

ScaleTrotter allows viewers to smoothly transition from the\nnucleus of a cell to the atomistic composition of the DNA, while bridging\nseveral orders of magnitude in scale. The challenges in creating an interactive\nvisualization of genome data are fundamentally different in several ways from\nthose in other domains like astronomy that require a multi-scale representation\nas well. First, genome data has intertwined scale levels---the DNA is an\nextremely long, connected molecule that manifests itself at all scale levels.\nSecond, elements of the DNA do not disappear as one zooms out---instead the\nscale levels at which they are observed group these elements differently.\nThird, we have detailed information and thus geometry for the entire dataset\nand for all scale levels, posing a challenge for interactive visual\nexploration. Finally, the conceptual scale levels for genome data are close in\nscale space, requiring us to find ways to visually embed a smaller scale into a\ncoarser one. We address these challenges by creating a new multi-scale\nvisualization concept. We use a scale-dependent camera model that controls the\nvisual embedding of the scales into their respective parents, the rendering of\na subset of the scale hierarchy, and the location, size, and scope of the view.\nIn traversing the scales, ScaleTrotter is roaming between 2D and 3D visual\nrepresentations that are depicted in integrated visuals. We discuss,\nspecifically, how this form of multi-scale visualization follows from the\nspecific characteristics of the genome data and describe its implementation.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of our work to the general illustrative\ndepiction of multi-scale data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 12:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

Since Ethereum charges resource\nusage, even small optimizations translate to cost savings. Airdrops, a popular\nmarketing tool used to boost coin uptake, present a relevant example for the\nvalue of optimizing bulk transfers. Therefore, we review technical solutions\nfor airdrops of Ethereum-based tokens, discuss features and prerequisites, and\ncompare the operational costs by simulating 35 scenarios.

Here we used the spatial distribution of\ngalaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution. The study is based on\nour CLASSIX galaxy cluster survey, which is highly complete and well\ncharacterised with galaxy clusters detected in X-rays. We find a local\nunderdensity in the cluster distribution of about 30 - 60% which extends ~85\nMpc to the north and ~170 Mpc to the south. For three regions for which the\ngalaxy density distribution has previously been studied, we find good agreement\nbetween the density distribution of clusters and galaxies. Correcting for the\nbias in the cluster distribution we infer an underdensity in the matter\ndistribution of about -0.3 +- 0.15 (-0.2 +- 0.1) in a region with a radius of\nabout 100 (~140) Mpc. Calculating the probability of finding such an\nunderdensity theoretically in a LambdaCDM universe with concordance\ncosmological parameters, we find a probability characterised by sigma-values of\n1.3-3.7. This indicates low probabilities, but with values of around 10% at the\nlower uncertainty limit, the existence of an underdensity cannot be ruled out.\nInside this underdensity, the observed Hubble parameter will be larger by about\n5.5 +2.1-2.8%, which explains part of the discrepancy between the locally\nmeasured value of H_0 compared to the value of H_0 inferred from the Planck\nobservations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. If distance\nindicators outside the local underdensity are included, as in many modern\nanalyses, this effect is diluted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 16:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

Thus, pixel-level features are\ndesired for scene parsing. However, classification networks are dominated by\nthe discriminative portion, so directly applying classification networks to\nscene parsing will result in inconsistent parsing predictions within one\ninstance and among instances of the same category. To address this problem, we\npropose two transform units to learn pixel-level consensus features. One is an\nInstance Consensus Transform (ICT) unit to learn the instance-level consensus\nfeatures by aggregating features within the same instance. The other is a\nCategory Consensus Transform (CCT) unit to pursue category-level consensus\nfeatures through keeping the consensus of features among instances of the same\ncategory in scene images.

A clear\nsignature of a long-range ordered magnetic ground state has been observed in\nthe heat capacity data, which exhibit two sharp anomalies at 39.5 and 36 K\nfound as well in the magnetic data. Further confirmation of long-range magnetic\nordering comes from a sharp drop in the muon initial asymmetry and a peak in\nthe relaxation rate at 40 K, along with a weak anomaly near 36 K.

The work concentrates on HR 10 (A2 IV/V), known for its\nconspicuous variability in the circumstellar narrow absorption features of Ca\nII K and other lines, so far interpreted as $\\beta$ Pic-like phenomena, within\nthe falling evaporating body scenario. The main goal of this paper is to carry\nout a thorough study of HR 10 to find the origin of the observed variability,\ndetermine the nature of the star, its absolute parameters, and evolutionary\nstatus. Interferometric near-infrared (NIR) observations, multi-epoch\nhigh-resolution optical spectra spanning a time baseline of more than 32 years,\nand optical and NIR photometry, together with theoretical modelling, were used\nto tackle the above objectives. Our results reveal that HR 10 is a binary. The\nnarrow circumstellar absorption features superimposed on the photospheric Ca II\nK lines -- and lines of other species -- can be decomposed into two or more\ncomponents, the two deep ones tracing the radial velocity of the individual\nstars, which implies that their origin cannot be ascribed to transient\nexocometary events, their variability being fully explained by the binarity of\nthe object. There does not appear to be transient events associated with\npotential exocomets. Each individual star holds its own circumstellar shell and\nthere are no traces of a circumbinary envelope. The combined use of the\ninterferometric and radial velocity data leads to a complete spectrometric and\norbital solution for the binary, the main parameters being: an orbital period\nof 747.6 days, eccentricities of the orbits around the centre of mass 0.25 (HR\n10-A), 0.21 (HR 10-B) and a mass ratio of q=M$_{\\rm B}$/M$_{\\rm A}$=0.72-0.84.\nThe stars are slightly off the main sequence, the binary being $\\sim530$ Myr\nold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 14:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

This\ntechnique, the Four-Dimensional Unsubtraction (FDU), is based on the Loop-Tree\nDuality (LTD) theorem, and aims at building pure four-dimensional\nrepresentations of scattering amplitudes at higher orders in perturbation\ntheory. This is done by locally renormalising the virtual contribution at high\nenergies, and then mapping the kinematics of the corresponding real\ncontribution so it matches the virtual one in the soft and collinear limits.\nThis makes the ultraviolet and infrared singularities vanish at the integrand\nlevel when taking the sum of both contributions, meaning that the\nfour-dimensional limit can be taken before integrating, thus allowing for a\nstraightforward numerical implementation.

The process starts with an\ninitial configuration, where all lattice sites are occupied and, obviously, the\nopposite sides of the lattice are connected by occupied sites. Then, the system\nis diluted by removing $k^{2}$-mers of occupied sites from the lattice\nfollowing a random sequential adsorption mechanism. The process finishes when\nthe jamming state is reached and no more objects can be removed due to the\nabsence of occupied sites clusters of appropriate size and shape. The central\nidea of this paper is based on finding the maximum concentration of occupied\nsites, $p_{c,k}$, for which the connectivity disappears. This particular value\nof the concentration is called \\textit{inverse percolation threshold}, and\ndetermines a well-defined geometrical phase transition in the system. The\nresults obtained for $p_{c,k}$ show that the inverse percolation threshold is a\ndecreasing function of $k$ in the range $1 \\leq k \\leq 4$. For $k \\geq 5$, all\njammed configurations are percolating states, and consequently, there is no\nnon-percolating phase. In other words, the lattice remains connected even when\nthe highest allowed concentration of removed sites is reached.

In addition, the accurate determination of the critical exponents\n$\\nu$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ reveals that the percolation phase transition\ninvolved in the system, which occurs for $k$ varying between 1 and 4, has the\nsame universality class as the standard percolation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 14:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

There is\nnot a mapping between the constraints obtained in this manner and alternative\ntheories that exhibit equivalence principle violations.

The first stage\noccurs at finite fragment of the chain and is characterized by power-law decay\nof the breather amplitude. The second stage is characterized by extremely small\nbreather amplitudes that decay hyper-exponentially with the site number. Thus,\npractically, one can speak about finite penetration depth of the breather. This\nphenomenon is referred to as breather arrest (BA). As particular example, we\nexplore the chain with Hertzian contacts. Dependencies of the breather\npenetration depth on the initial excitation and on the damping coefficient on\nthe breather penetration depth obey power laws.

However, most existing deep\ncross-modal hashing methods either cannot learn a unified hash code for the two\ncorrelated data-points of different modalities in a database instance or cannot\nguide the learning of unified hash codes by the feedback of hashing function\nlearning procedure, to enhance the retrieval accuracy.

HLS tools\noffer a plethora of techniques to optimize designs for both area and\nperformance, but resource usage and timing reports of HLS tools mostly deviate\nfrom the post-implementation results. In addition, to evaluate a hardware\ndesign performance, it is critical to determine the maximum achievable clock\nfrequency.

Moreover, a\nbinary search to find the maximum frequency is tedious, time-consuming, and\noften does not obtain the optimal result.

Minerva determines\nthe close-to-optimal settings of tools, using static timing analysis and a\nheuristic algorithm, and targets either optimal throughput or\nthroughput-to-area. Pyramid uses the database to train an ensemble machine\nlearning model to map the HLS-reported features to the results of Minerva. To\nthis end, Pyramid re-calibrates the results of HLS to bridge the accuracy gap\nand enable developers to estimate the throughput or throughput-to-area of\nhardware design with more than 95% accuracy and alleviates the need to perform\nactual implementation for estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 01:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

As the process for creating an intricate part for an expensive metal\nsuch as Titanium is prohibitive with respect to cost, computational models are\nused to simulate the behavior of AM processes before the experimental run.\nHowever, as the simulations are computationally costly and time-consuming for\npredicting multiscale multi-physics phenomena in AM, physics-informed\ndata-driven machine-learning systems for predicting the behavior of AM\nprocesses are immensely beneficial.

The aim of this work is to propose a\nmodified version of this model by analogy with the classical predator-prey\nmodels, in particular considering non-users as prey and users as predator.\nHence, our model includes a stabilizing effect of the growth rate of the prey,\nand a destabilizing effect of the predator saturation. Functional responses of\nVerhulst and of Holling type II have been used for modeling these effects. To\nforecast the marijuana consumption in the states of Colorado and Washington, we\nused data from Hanley (2013) and a genetic algorithm to calibrate the\nparameters in our model. Assuming that the population of non-users increases in\nproportion with the demography, and following the seminal works of Sir Robert\nMay (1976), we use the growth rate of non-users as the main bifurcation\nparameter. For the state of Colorado, the model first exhibits a limit cycle,\nwhich agrees quite accurately with the reported periodic data in Hanley (2013).\nBy further increasing the growth rate of non-users, the population then enters\ninto two chaotic regions, within which the evolution of the variables becomes\nunpredictable. For the state of Washington, the model also exhibits a periodic\nsolution, which is again in good agreement with observed data. A chaotic region\nfor Washington is likewise observed in the bifurcation diagram. Our research\nconfirms that mathematical models can be a useful tool for better understanding\nillicit drug consumption, and for guiding policy-makers towards more effective\npolicies to contain this epidemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 06:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

The expressive power of partially ordered automata\nis closely related to the expressivity of fragments of first-order logic on\nfinite words or, equivalently, to the language classes of the levels of the\nStraubing-Th\\'erien hierarchy. Several fragments (levels) have been intensively\ninvestigated under various names. For instance, the fragment of first-order\nformulae with a single existential block of quantifiers in prenex normal form\nis known as piecewise testable languages or $J$-trivial languages. These\nlanguages are characterized by confluent partially ordered DFAs or by complete,\nconfluent, and self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs (ptNFAs for\nshort). In this paper, we study the complexity of basic questions for several\ntypes of partially ordered automata on finite words; namely, the questions of\ninclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability. The lower-bound\ncomplexity boils down to the complexity of universality. The universality\nproblem asks whether a system recognizes all words over its alphabet. For\nptNFAs, the complexity of universality decreases if the alphabet is fixed, but\nit is open if the alphabet may grow with the number of states. We show that\ndeciding universality for general ptNFAs is as hard as for general NFAs. Our\nproof is a novel and nontrivial extension of our recent construction for\nself-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs, a model strictly more\nexpressive than ptNFAs.

However, in our world, getting from one place to another\nalways takes time and places that are further away take more time to be\nreached. We thus set off to extend the theory of stochastic resetting such that\nit would account for this inherent spatio-temporal coupling. We consider a\nparticle that starts at the origin and follows a certain law of stochastic\nmotion until it is interrupted at some random time. The particle then returns\nto the origin via a prescribed protocol. We study this model and surprisingly\ndiscover that the shape of the steady-state distribution which governs the\nstochastic motion phase does not depend on the return protocol. This shape\ninvariance then gives rise to a simple, and generic, recipe for the computation\nof the full steady-state distribution. Several case studies are analyzed and a\nclass of processes whose steady-state is completely invariant with respect to\nthe speed of return is highlighted. For processes in this class we recover the\nsame steady-state obtained for resetting with instantaneous\nreturns---irrespective of whether the actual return speed is high or low.

When these ODEs are subjected to unilateral constraints and\nvelocity jump conditions, one must use an event detection algorithm to\ncalculate the time of impact accurately. Event detection in the presence of\nmultiple simultaneous impacts is a computationally demanding task. Ivanov\nproposed a nonsmooth transformation for a vibro-impacting\nmulti-degree-of-freedom system subjected to a single unilateral constraint.\nThis transformation eliminates the unilateral constraints from the problem and,\ntherefore, no event detection is required during numerical integration.

However, the large soliton comb spacing hampers some applications. For\nexample, for spectroscopic applications, there are simply not enough comb lines\navailable to sufficiently cover almost any relevant absorption features. Here,\nwe overcome this limitation by scanning the comb mode spacing by employing PDH\nlocking and a microheater on the microresonator, showing continuous scanning of\nthe soliton comb modes across nearly the full FSR of the microresonator without\nlosing soliton operation, while spectral features with a bandwidth of as small\nof 5 MHz are resolved. Thus, comb mode scanning allows to cover the whole comb\nmode spectrum of tens of THz bandwidth with only one chip-scale comb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 04:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}
