Double core hole (DCH) X-ray emission is\na new form of X-ray nonlinear spectroscopy that can be studied with a XFEL.\nHere we computationally explore the metal K-edge valence-to-core (VtC) X-ray\nemission spectroscopy (XES) of metal/metal and metal/ligand double core hole\nstates in a series of transition metal complexes with time-dependent density\nfunctional theory. The simulated DCH VtC-XES signals are compared with\nconventional single core hole (SCH) XES signals. The energy shifts and\nintensity changes of the DCH emission lines with respect to the corresponding\nSCH-XES features are fingerprints of the coupling between the second core hole\nand the occupied orbitals around the DCHs that contain important chemical\nbonding information of the complex. The core hole localization effect on DCH\nVtC-XES is also briefly discussed. We theoretically demonstrate that DCH XES\nprovides subtle information on the local electronic structure around metal\ncenters in transition metal complexes beyond conventional linear XES. Our\npredicted changes from calculations between SCH-XES and DCH-XES features should\nbe detectable with modern XFEL sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 16:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 17:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this\nregard, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently gained ever-growing\nattention from both academia and industry. Compared to orthogonal multiple\naccess (OMA) techniques, NOMA is superior in terms of spectral efficiency and\nis thus appropriate for 5G and Beyond. In this article, we provide an overview\nof NOMA principles and applications. Specifically, the article discusses the\nfundamentals of power-domain NOMA with single and multiple antennas in both\nuplink and downlink settings. In addition, the basic principles of code-domain\nNOMA are elaborated. Further, the article explains various resource allocation\ntechniques such as user pairing and power allocation for NOMA systems;\ndiscusses the basic form of cooperative NOMA and its variants; and addresses\nseveral opportunities and challenges associated with the compatibility of NOMA\nwith other advanced communication paradigms such as heterogeneous networks and\nmillimeter wave communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 16:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

By extending the Large Deviations approach for a\ncontinuous time random walk we uncover a general universal behavior for the\ndecay of the density. It is found that fluctuations in the number of steps of\nthe random walker, performed at finite time, lead to exponential decay (with\nlogarithmic corrections) of $P(X,t)$.

Although there are many\ntypes of objects in the real-word, current semantic segmentation methods make a\nclosed world assumption and are trained only to segment a limited number of\nobject classes. Towards a more open world approach, we propose a novel method\nthat incrementally learns new classes for image segmentation. The proposed\nsystem first segments each RGBD frame using both color and geometric\ninformation, and then aggregates that information to build a single segmented\ndense 3D map of the environment. The segmented 3D map representation is a key\ncomponent of our approach as it is used to discover new object classes by\nidentifying coherent regions in the 3D map that have no semantic label. The use\nof coherent region in the 3D map as a primitive element, rather than\ntraditional elements such as surfels or voxels, also significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity and memory use of our method. It thus leads to\nsemi-real-time performance at {10.7}Hz when incrementally updating the dense 3D\nmap at every frame. Through experiments on the NYUDv2 dataset, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed method is able to correctly cluster objects of both known and\nunseen classes.

At\nmacroscales, the reestablishment of segregation within the affected hemisphere\nand interhemispheric integration has been extensively documented in the\nreconfiguration of brain networks. However, the local connection mechanisms\ngenerating such global network changes are still largely unknown as well as\ntheir potential to better predict the outcome of patients. To address this\nquestion, time must be considered as a formal variable of the problem and not\njust a simple repeated observation. Here, we hypothesize that the temporal\nformation of basic connection blocks such as intermodule edges and intramodule\ntriangles would be sufficient to determine the large-scale brain reorganization\nafter stroke. To test our hypothesis, we adopted a statistical approach based\non temporal exponential random graph models (tERGMs). First, we validated the\noverall performance on synthetic time-varying networks simulating the\nreconfiguration process after stroke. Then, using longitudinal functional\nconnectivity measurements of resting-state brain activity, we showed that both\nthe formation of triangles within the affected hemisphere and interhemispheric\nlinks are sufficient to reproduce the longitudinal brain network changes from 2\nweeks to 1 year after the stroke. Finally, we showed that these temporal\nconnection mechanisms are over-expressed in the subacute phase as compared to\nhealthy controls and predicted the chronic language and visual outcome\nrespectively in patients with subcortical and cortical lesions, whereas static\napproaches failed to do so. Our results indicate the importance of considering\ntime-varying connection properties when modeling dynamic complex systems and\nprovide fresh insights into the network mechanisms of stroke recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 17:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

This is also the reason why the organic/inorganic system can be\nengineered for several applications by fine-tuning the metallic work function.\nHere, we use density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with different level\nof functional approximations for a systematic study of thiophene interacting\nwith Copper surfaces. In particular, we considered adsorbed structures with the\nthiophene molecule seated on the top site, with the S atom of the molecule\nlocated on the top of a Cu atom. In this work, we find that the weak\nchemisorption hypothesis of thiophene binding on the copper surface is well\njustified by the two meta-GGAs-based approximations, SCAN and SCAN+rVV10.\nPBE-GGA and TM meta-GGA describe it as a physisorption phenomenon by\nsignificantly underestimating the adsorption energies. Calculated adsorption\nenergy curves reveal that non-local dispersion interaction between the molecule\nand metallic surface predominantly controls the bonding mechanism and thus,\nmodifies the copper's work function. Our results imply that semi-local\nfunctionals without any kind of van der Waals (vdW) correction can often\nmisinterpret this as physisorption, while, a fortuitous error cancellation can\ngive a right description of this adsorption picture for a wrong reason as in\nthe case of SCAN. The calculated density of states of the adsorbed molecule\nshows that the long-range vdW correction of SCAN+rVV10 causes more than enough\nhybridization between the \\textit{p} orbitals of S atom and the copper\n\\textit{d}-bands and therefore overestimates the adsorption energies by an\naverage of 16\\%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 17:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

We also find that the\nintrinsic morphologies of UDGs are relevant to their stellar\nmasses/luminosities, environments, and redshifts. First, for the low-redshift\nUDGs in the same environment, the more-luminous ones are always thicker than\nthe less-luminous counterparts, possibly due to the more voilent internal\nsupernovae feedback or external tidal interactions for the progenitors of the\nmore-luminous UDGs. The UDG thickness dependence on luminosity is distinct from\nthat of the typical quiescent dwarf ellipticals (dEs) and dwarf spheroidals\n(dSphs) in the local clusters and groups, but resembles that of massive\ngalaxies; in this sense, UDGs may not be simply treated as an extension of the\ndE/dSph class with similar evolutionary histories. Second, for the low-redshift\nUDGs within the same luminosity range, the ones with smaller cluster-centric\ndistances are more puffed-up, probably attributed to tidal interactions.\nFinally, the intermediate-redshift cluster UDGs are more flattened, which\nplausibly suggests a `disky' origin for high-redshift, initial UDGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 18:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 02:17:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 19:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 21:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 02:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

At the moment, ex-post\nnetwork tariffs are utilized in addition to congestion revenues to fully\nrecover network costs, which often leads to over/under fixed cost recovery,\nthus increasing the investment risk. Furthermore, in the case of agents with\nelastic market curves, ex-post tariffs can cause several inefficiencies, such\nas mistrustful bidding to exploit ex-post schemes, imperfect information in\napplied costs and cleared quantities, and negative surplus for marginal\ngenerators and consumers. These problems are exacerbated by the increasing\nprice-elasticity of demand, caused for example by the diffusion of demand\nresponse technologies. To address these issues, we design a dynamic ex-ante\ntariff scheme that explicitly accounts for the effect of tariffs in the\nlongterm network planning problem and in the underlying market clearing\nprocess. Using linearization techniques and a novel reformulation of the\ncongestion rent, the long-term network planning problem is reformulated as a\nsingle mixed-integer linear problem which returns the combined optimal values\nof network expansion and associated tariffs, while accounting for price-elastic\nagents and lumpy investments.

With the\nexception of cold torquing, also known as \"churning,\" processes that contribute\nto the radial migration of stars are necessarily associated with kinematic\nheating. Additionally, it is an open question whether or not an episode of cold\ntorquing is kinemically cold over long radial distances. This study uses a\nsuite of analytically based simulations to investigate the dynamical response\nwhen stars are subject to cold torquing and are also resonant with an\nultraharmonic. Model results demonstrate that these populations are\nkinematically heated and have RMS changes in orbital angular momentum around\ncorotation that can exceed those of populations that do not experience resonant\noverlap. Thus, kinematic heating can occur during episodes of cold torquing.

Most of the literature in this area has focused on\nestablishing worst-case bounds for specific classes of games, such as routing\ngames or more general congestion games. Recently, the price of anarchy in\nrouting games has been studied as a function of the traffic demand, providing\nasymptotic results in light and heavy traffic. The aim of this paper is to\nstudy the price of anarchy in nonatomic routing games in the intermediate\nregion of the demand. To achieve this goal, we begin by establishing some\nsmoothness properties of Wardrop equilibria and social optima for general\nsmooth costs. In the case of affine costs we show that the equilibrium is\npiecewise linear, with break points at the demand levels at which the set of\nactive paths changes. We prove that the number of such break points is finite,\nalthough it can be exponential in the size of the network. Exploiting a scaling\nlaw between the equilibrium and the social optimum, we derive a similar\nbehavior for the optimal flows. We then prove that in any interval between\nbreak points the price of anarchy is smooth and it is either monotone\n(decreasing or increasing) over the full interval, or it decreases up to a\ncertain minimum point in the interior of the interval and increases afterwards.\nWe deduce that for affine costs the maximum of the price of anarchy can only\noccur at the break points. For general costs we provide counterexamples showing\nthat the set of break points is not always finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 18:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 15:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Backpropagation neural networks\n(i.e., BP-NNs) based approaches have recently drawn attention because of their\ngood generalization capability. In a typical situation, BP-NN-based models are\niteratively optimized in server machines with input data gathered from edge\ndevices. However, (1) the iterative optimization often requires significant\nefforts to follow changes in the distribution of normal data (i.e., concept\ndrift), and (2) data transfers between edge and server impose additional\nlatency and energy consumption. To address these issues, we propose ONLAD and\nits IP core, named ONLAD Core. ONLAD is highly optimized to perform fast\nsequential learning to follow concept drift in less than one millisecond. ONLAD\nCore realizes on-device learning for edge devices at low power consumption,\nwhich realizes standalone execution where data transfers between edge and\nserver are not required. Experiments show that ONLAD has favorable anomaly\ndetection capability in an environment that simulates concept drift.\nEvaluations of ONLAD Core confirm that the training latency is 1.95x~6.58x\nfaster than the other software implementations.

Recently, many efforts have been\ndevoted to one-stage detectors for the simple yet effective architecture.\nDifferent from two-stage detectors, one-stage detectors aim to identify\nforeground objects from all candidates in a single stage. This architecture is\nefficient but can suffer from the imbalance issue with respect to two aspects:\nthe inter-class imbalance between the number of candidates from foreground and\nbackground classes and the intra-class imbalance in the hardness of background\ncandidates, where only a few candidates are hard to be identified.

Although static analysis\nremains the prevalent approach for detecting timing side channels, it is\ncomputationally challenging for real-world applications. In addition, the\ndetection techniques are usually restricted to 'yes' or 'no' answers. In\npractice, real-world applications may need to leak information about the\nsecret. Therefore, quantification techniques are necessary to evaluate the\nresulting threats of information leaks. Since both problems are very difficult\nor impossible for static analysis techniques, we propose a dynamic analysis\nmethod. Our novel approach is to split the problem into two tasks. First, we\nlearn a timing model of the program as a neural network. Second, we analyze the\nneural network to quantify information leaks. As demonstrated in our\nexperiments, both of these tasks are feasible in practice --- making the\napproach a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art side channel\ndetectors and quantifiers. Our key technical contributions are (a) a neural\nnetwork architecture that enables side channel discovery and (b) an MILP-based\nalgorithm to estimate the side-channel strength. On a set of micro-benchmarks\nand real-world applications, we show that neural network models learn timing\nbehaviors of programs with thousands of methods.

As 3D printing every frame\nof a computer animation is prohibitively slow and expensive, 3D printed\nstop-motion can only be viable if animations can be faithfully reproduced using\na compact library of 3D printed and efficiently assemblable parts. We thus\npresent the first system for processing computer animation sequences (typically\nfaces) to produce an optimal set of replacement parts for use in 3D printed\nstop-motion animation. Given an input animation sequence of topology invariant\ndeforming meshes, our problem is to output a library of replacement parts and\nper-animation-frame assignment of the parts, such that we maximally approximate\nthe input animation, while minimizing the amount of 3D printing and assembly.\nInspired by current stop-motion workflows, a user manually indicates which\nparts of the model are preferred for segmentation; then, we find curves with\nminimal deformation along which to segment the mesh. We then present a novel\nalgorithm to zero out deformations along the segment boundaries, so that\nreplacement sets for each part can be interchangeably and seamlessly assembled\ntogether. The part boundaries are designed to ease 3D printing and\ninstrumentation for assembly. Each part is then independently optimized using a\ngraph-cut technique to find a set of replacements, whose size can be user\ndefined, or automatically computed to adhere to a printing budget or allowed\ndeviation from the original animation. Our evaluation is threefold: we show\nresults on a variety of facial animations, both digital and 3D printed,\ncritiqued by a professional animator; we show the impact of various algorithmic\nparameters; and compare our results to naive solutions.

In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space,\nusually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a\nVAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with\nspeaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original\nspeaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due\nto the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be\ndirectly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC.\nIn this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based\nspectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the\nconverted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic\nreconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be\ncontinued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next\ncycle.

Dynamic and static correlation is\ntaken into account by performing CCSD and CASSCF calculations, respectively.\nBecause the strength of harmonic confinement cannot be translated into\npressure, we envisioned a \"calibration\" method to transform confinement into\npressure. We focused on the effect of confinement on: i) changes of electron\ndistribution and localization within the $K$ and $L$ atomic shells, ii)\nconfinement-induced ionization pressure, iii) level crossing of electronic\nstates, and iv) the electron correlation energy.

If such a\nbarrier is eliminated, however, evidence shows that responding to reviews\nenhances end-users satisfaction and contributes towards the success of\nproducts. In this paper, we present Appsent, a mobile analytics tool as an app,\nto facilitate the analysis of app reviews. This development was led by a\nliterature review on the problem and subsequent evaluation of current available\nsolutions to this challenge. Our investigation found that there was scope to\nextend currently available tools that analyze app reviews. These gaps thus\ninformed the design and development of Appsent. We subsequently performed an\nempirical evaluation to validate Appsent usability and the helpfulness of\nanalytics features from users perspective. Outcomes of this evaluation reveal\nthat Appsent provides user-friendly interfaces, helpful functionalities and\nmeaningful analytics. Appsent extracts and visualizes important perceptions\nfrom end-users feedback, identifying insights into end-users opinions about\nvarious aspects of software features. Although Appsent was developed as a\nprototype for analyzing app reviews, this tool may be of utility for analyzing\nproduct reviews more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 00:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

We have implemented and\nsystematically compared two convolutional neural networks, U-Net and\nDenseU-Net, under different conditions. Though both models can perform\nautomatic contour tracking with comparable accuracy, Dense U-Net architecture\nseems more generalizable across test datasets while U-Net has faster extraction\nspeed. Our comparison also shows that the choice of loss function and data\naugmentation have a greater effect on tracking performance in this task. This\npublic available segmentation tool shows considerable promise for the automated\ntongue contour annotation of ultrasound images in speech research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 02:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

The former aims to expand the applicable\nmachine learning models of FL. The latter focuses on who holds the secret key\nwhen applying HE to FL. For the naive HE scheme, the server is set to master\nthe secret key. Such a setting causes a serious problem that if the server does\nnot conduct aggregation before decryption, a chance is left for the server to\naccess the user's update. Inspired by the two challenges, we propose FedXGB, a\nfederated extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) scheme supporting forced\naggregation. FedXGB mainly achieves the following two breakthroughs. First,\nFedXGB involves a new HE based secure aggregation scheme for FL. By combining\nthe advantages of secret sharing and homomorphic encryption, the algorithm can\nsolve the second challenge mentioned above, and is robust to the user dropout.\nThen, FedXGB extends FL to a new machine learning model by applying the secure\naggregation scheme to the classification and regression tree building of\nXGBoost. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and\nextensive experiments to evaluate the security, effectiveness, and efficiency\nof FedXGB. The results indicate that FedXGB achieves less than 1% accuracy loss\ncompared with the original XGBoost, and can provide about 23.9% runtime and\n33.3% communication reduction for HE based model update aggregation of FL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 03:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 13:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

If cameras move fast or are far away from\nmarkers, matching is easy to generate errors and even RANSAC cannot remove\nincorrect matching. Then, the result by PnP cannot have good performance. To\nsolve this problem, we design circular markers and represent 6D camera pose\nanalytically and unifiedly as very concise forms from each of the marker by\nprojective invariance. Afterwards, the pose is further optimized by a proposed\nnonlinear cost function based on a polar-n-direction geometric distance.

Moreover, it does not always hold that the manually labeled data\nand the unlabeled data are sitting in the same distribution. In this paper, we\nalleviate these problems by proposing a discriminative consistent domain\ngeneration (DCDG) approach to achieve a semi-supervised learning. The\ndiscriminative consistent domain is achieved by a double-sided domain\nadaptation. The double-sided domain adaptation aims to make a fusion of the\nfeature spaces of labeled data and unlabeled data. In this way, we can fit the\ndifferences of various distributions between labeled data and unlabeled data.\nIn order to keep the discriminativeness of generated consistent domain for the\ntask learning, we apply an indirect learning for the double-sided domain\nadaptation. Based on the generated discriminative consistent domain, we can use\nthe unlabeled data to learn the task model along with the labeled data via a\nconsistent image generation.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the immune cells find\ntheir targets by chance, or if they approach them 'on purpose', using remote\nsensing mechanisms such as chemotaxis. In this work, we present methods to\ninfer the strength and range of long-range cell-cell interactions from\ntime-lapse recorded cell trajectories, using a maximum likelihood method to fit\nthe model parameters. First, we model the interactions as a distance-dependent\n'force' that attracts immune cells towards their nearest tumor cell.

The halo\nis very faint at higher frequencies and is barely detected by follow-up 1-2 GHz\nKarl G.~Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations, which enable us to\nconstrain the radio spectral index to be $\\alpha\\leq 1.5-1.6$, i.e.; with\nproperties between canonical and ultra-steep spectrum radio halos. Radio halos\nare currently explained as synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons\nthat are re-accelerated in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by turbulence driven\nby energetic mergers. We show that in such a framework radio halos are expected\nto be relatively common at $\\sim150$ MHz ($\\sim30-60\\%$) in clusters with mass\nand redshift similar to PSZ2 G099.86+58.45; however, at least 2/3 of these\nradio halos should have steep spectrum and thus be very faint above $\\sim 1$\nGHz frequencies. Furthermore, since the luminosity of radio halos at high\nredshift depends strongly on the magnetic field strength in the hosting\nclusters, future LOFAR observations will also provide vital information on the\norigin and amplification of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 08:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

If a unique solution does not exist, the observability\nanalysis defines observable islands and further defines an additional set of\nequations (measurements) needed to determine a unique solution. For the first\ntime, we utilise factor graphs and Gaussian belief propagation algorithm to\ndefine a novel observability analysis approach. The observable islands and\nplacement of measurements to restore observability are identified by following\nthe evolution of variances across the iterations of the Gaussian belief\npropagation algorithm over the factor graph. Due to sparsity of the underlying\npower network, the resulting method has the linear computational complexity\n(assuming a constant number of iterations) making it particularly suitable for\nsolving large-scale systems.

Because the liver is the only organ in the human body that is\nsupplied by two major vessels: the hepatic artery and the portal vein, various\ntypes of malignant tumors can spread from other organs to the liver. And due to\nthe liver masses' heterogeneous and diffusive shape, the tumor lesions are very\ndifficult to be recognized, thus automatic lesion detection is necessary for\nthe doctors with huge workloads. To assist doctors, this work uses the existing\nlarge-scale annotation medical image data to delve deep into liver lesion\ndetection from multiple directions. To solve technical difficulties, such as\nthe image-recognition task, traditional deep learning with convolution neural\nnetworks (CNNs) has been widely applied in recent years.

To be specific, we\nconsider a 2D square lattice tight-binding model with an obliquely introduced\nsuperlattice. It is demonstrated that quantized particle transport occurs in\nthis system, and that the transport is expressed as a solution of a Diophantine\nequation. This topological nature can be understood by mapping the Hamiltonian\nto a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice model with a homogeneous magnetic\nfield. We also propose a continuum model with obliquely introduced superlattice\nand obtain the amount of pumping by calculating the Berry curvature. For this\nmodel, the same Diophantine equation can be derived from the plane-wave\napproximation. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of a harmonic trap by\nsolving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. Under a harmonic trap\npotential, as often used in cold atom experiments, we show, by numerical\nsimulations, that nearly quantized pumping occurs when the phase of the\nsuperlattice potential is driven at a moderate speed. Also, we find that two\nregions appear, the Hofstadter region and the rectifying region, depending on\nthe modulation amplitude of the superlattice potential. In the rectifying\nregion with larger modulation amplitudes, we uncover that the pumping direction\nis restricted to exactly the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis direction. This\ndifference in these two regions causes a crossover behavior, characterizing the\neffect of the harmonic trap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 10:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 09:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 04:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Our experiments with different V/III ratios and substrate temperatures\nshow that obtaining shells with homogeneous thickness along the whole NW length\nis not straightforward. Analyzing in detail the shell morphology with and\nwithout substrate rotation, we find that the different azimuthal angles of the\nsources have a major impact on the Ga adatom kinetics and the final shell\nmorphology. On the basis of these experimental results, we develop a diffusion\nmodel which takes into account different NW facets and the substrate. The model\nallows to describe well the experimental shell profiles and predicts that\nhomogeneous shell growth can be achieved if the Ga and N source are arranged\nnext to each other or for very high rotation speeds.

Since the introduction of industrial control systems in the 1970's,\nindustrial networks have been the target of malicious actors. More recently,\nthe political and warfare-aspects of attacks on industrial and critical\ninfrastructure are becoming more relevant. In contrast to classic home and\noffice IT systems, industrial IT, so-called OT systems, have an effect on the\nphysical world. Furthermore, industrial devices have long operation times,\nsometimes several decades. Updates and fixes are tedious and often not\npossible. The threats on industry with the legacy requirements of industrial\nenvironments creates the need for efficient intrusion detection that can be\nintegrated into existing systems. In this work, the network data containing\nindustrial operation is analysed with machine learning- and time series- based\nanomaly detection algorithms in order to discover the attacks introduced to the\ndata. Two different data sets are used, one Modbus-based gas pipeline control\ntraffic and one OPC UA-based batch processing traffic. In order to detect\nattacks, two machine learning-based algorithms are used, namely \\textit{SVM}\nand Random Forest. Both perform well, with Random Forest slightly outperforming\nSVM.

It is very\noften the case that some roll-outs result in failure behaviors, causing\npremature experiment detention. In such cases, the designer is forced to decide\non heuristic cost penalties because the acquired data is often scarce, or not\ncomparable with that of the stable policies. To overcome this, we propose a\nBayesian model that captures exactly what we know about the cost of unstable\ncontrollers prior to data collection: Nothing, except that it should be a\nsomewhat large number. The resulting Bayesian model, approximated with a\nGaussian process, predicts high cost values in regions where failures are\nlikely to occur. In this way, the model guides the BO exploration toward\nregions of stability. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model in\nseveral illustrative and statistical synthetic benchmarks, and also in\nexperiments on a real robotic platform.

While this high flexibility allows to adapt a member of the\nparametric family to a wide range of data patterns, it also implies that\nparameter estimation is a more delicate operation with respect to less flexible\nparametric families, given that a small variation of the parameters can have a\nsubstantial effect on the selected distribution.

However, these methods that target PSNR\nmaximization usually produce blurred images at large upscaling factor. The\nintroduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) can mitigate this issue\nand show impressive results with synthetic high-frequency textures.\nNevertheless, these GAN-based approaches always have a tendency to add fake\ntextures and even artifacts to make the SR image of visually higher-resolution.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel perceptual image super-resolution method that\nprogressively generates visually high-quality results by constructing a\nstage-wise network.

Traditional Learning to Rank\n(LTR) algorithms require relevance judgments on products. In E-Com, getting\nsuch judgments poses an immense challenge. In the literature, it is proposed to\nemploy user feedback (such as clicks, add-to-basket (AtB) clicks and orders) to\ngenerate relevance judgments. It is done in two steps: first, query-product\npair data are aggregated from the logs and then order rate etc are calculated\nfor each pair in the logs. In this paper, we advocate counterfactual risk\nminimization (CRM) approach which circumvents the need of relevance judgements,\ndata aggregation and is better suited for learning from logged data, i.e.\ncontextual bandit feedback.

Pairwise constraints\nenforce the cluster labels of two instances to be the same (must-link\nconstraints) or different (cannot-link constraints). Cardinality constraints\nencourage cluster sizes to satisfy a user-specified distribution. Most existing\nconstrained clustering models can only utilize one category of constraints at a\ntime.

However, the optimization is difficult due to\nthe binary and quadratic constraints in the unified formulation. To solve this,\nwe utilize two techniques: equivalently replacing the binary constraints by the\nintersection of two continuous constraints; the other is transforming the\nquadratic constraints into bi-linear constraints by introducing extra\nvariables.

The frequent\nassociation of strange metals with unconventional superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetic QCPs has led to a belief that they are highly entangled\nquantum states. Ferromagnets, by contrast are regarded as an unlikely setting\nfor strange metals, for they are weakly entangled and their QCPs are often\ninterrupted by competing phases or first order phase transitions. Here, we\nprovide compelling evidence that the stoichiometric heavy fermion ferromagnet\nCeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ becomes a strange metal at a pressure-induced QCP: specific heat\nand resistivity measurements demonstrate that the FM transition is continuously\nsuppressed to zero temperature revealing a strange metal phase. We argue that\nstrong magnetic anisotropy plays a key role in this process,injecting\nentanglement, in the form of triplet resonating valence bonds (tRVBs) into the\nordered ferromagnet. We show that the singular transformation from tRVBs into\nKondo singlets that occurs at the QCP causes a jump in the Fermi surface\nvolume: a key driver of strange metallic behavior. Our results open up a new\ndirection for research into FM quantum criticality, while also establishing an\nimportant new setting for the strange metal problem. Most importantly, strange\nmetallic behavior at a FM quantum critical point suggests that it is quantum\nentanglement rather than the destruction of antiferromagnetism that is the\ncommon driver of the many varied examples of strange metallic behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 14:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 07:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

Local extremely metal-poor\ngalaxies (XMPs; defined as having an average gas-phase metallicity < 0.1 solar)\nare important objects for understanding galaxy evolution largely because they\nappear to be caught in the act of accreting gas from the cosmic web, and their\n3-D shape may reflect this. Here we report on the 3-D shape of XMPs as inferred\nfrom their observed projected minor-to-major axial ratios using a hierarchical\nBayesian inference model, which determines the likely shape and orientation of\neach galaxy while simultaneously inferring the average shape and dispersion. We\nselected a sample of 149 XMPs and divided it into three sub-samples according\nto physical size and found that (1) the stellar component of XMPs of all sizes\ntends to be triaxial, with an intermediate axis approx 0.7 times the longest\naxis and that (2) smaller XMPs tend to be relatively thicker, with the shortest\naxis going from approx 0.15 times the longest axis for the large galaxies to\napprox 0.4 for the small galaxies. We provide the inferred 3-D shape and\ninclination of the individual XMPs in electronic format. We show that our\nresults for the intermediate axis are not clouded by a selection effect against\nface-on XMPs. We discuss how an intermediate axis significantly smaller than\nthe longest axis may be produced by several mechanisms, including lopsided gas\naccretion, non-axisymmetric star formation, or coupling with an elongated dark\nmatter halo. Large relative thickness may reflect slow rotation, stellar\nfeedback, or recent gas accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 15:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

High error in estimation may necessarily not result in high prediction\nerror, but can lead to an unreliable prediction if test data lie in a slightly\ndifferent subspace than the training data. In addition, high estimation error\noften leads to unstable estimates, and consequently, the estimated effect of\npredictors on the response can not have a valid interpretation. Many research\nfields show more interest in the effect of predictor variables than actual\nprediction performance. This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and\nwell-established (PCR, PLS) estimation methods using simulated data with\nspecifically designed properties such as Multicollinearity in the predictor\nvariables, the correlation between multiple responses and the position of\nprincipal components corresponding to predictors that are relevant for the\nresponse. This study aims to give some insights into these methods and help the\nresearchers to understand and use them for further study. Here we have, not\nsurprisingly, found that no single method is superior to others, but each has\nits strength for some specific nature of data.

The age of the\ndinosaurs was abruptly ended by a 10-km-diameter asteroid. Currently, a nuclear\ndevice is the only means of deflecting large Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\n(PHAs) away from an Earth-impacting trajectory. The Enhanced Kinetic Impactor\n(EKI) concept is proposed to deflect large PHAs via maneuvering space rocks.\nFirst, an unmanned spacecraft is launched to rendezvous with an intermediate\nNear-Earth Asteroid (NEA). Then, more than one hundred tons of rocks are\ncollected from the NEA as the EKI. The NEA can also be captured as the EKI if\nthe NEA is very small. Finally, the EKI is maneuvered to impact the PHA at a\nhigh speed, resulting in a significant deflection of the PHA. For example, to\ndeflect Apophis, as much as 200 t of rocks could be collected from a NEA as the\nEKI based on existing engineering capabilities. The EKI can produce a velocity\nincrement (delta-v) of 39.81 mm/s in Apophis, thereby increasing the minimum\ngeocentric distance during the close encounter in 2029 by 1,866.93 km. This\nmission can be completed in 3.96 years with a propellant cost of 2.98 t.\nCompared with a classic kinetic impactor, the deflection distance can be\nincreased one order of magnitude. The EKI concept breaks through the limitation\nof the ground-based launch capability, which can significantly increase the\nmass of the impactor.

Because there are numerous steganography algorithms, and\nsince each one of them requires a different type of steganalysis, the\nsteganalysis process is extremely challenging. Thus, researchers aim to develop\none universal steganalysis to detect all known and unknown steganography\nalgorithms, ideally in real-time. Universal steganalysis extracts a large\nnumber of features to distinguish stego images from cover images. However, the\nincrease in features leads to the problem of the curse of dimensionality (CoD),\nwhich is considered to be an NP-hard problem. This COD problem additionally\nmakes real-time steganalysis hard. A large number of features generates large\ndatasets for which machine learning cannot generate an optimal model.\nGenerating a machine learning based model also takes a long time which makes\nreal-time processing appear impossible in any optimization for time-intensive\nfields such as visual computing. Possible solutions for CoD are deep learning\nand evolutionary algorithms that overcome the machine learning limitations. In\nthis study, we investigate previously developed evolutionary algorithms for\nboosting real-time image processing and argue that they provide the most\npromising solutions for the CoD problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 16:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 05:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 16:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}
