However, little is known about the information dissemination process\nin WhatsApp groups. Attention affects the dissemination of information in\nWhatsApp groups, determining what topics or subjects are more attractive to\nparticipants of a group. In this paper, we characterize and analyze how\nattention propagates among the participants of a WhatsApp group. An attention\ncascade begins when a user asserts a topic in a message to the group, which\ncould include written text, photos, or links to articles online. Others then\npropagate the information by responding to it. We analyzed attention cascades\nin more than 1.7 million messages posted in 120 groups over one year. Our\nanalysis focused on the structural and temporal evolution of attention cascades\nas well as on the behavior of users that participate in them. We found specific\ncharacteristics in cascades associated with groups that discuss political\nsubjects and false information. For instance, we observe that cascades with\nfalse information tend to be deeper, reach more users, and last longer in\npolitical groups than in non-political groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 16:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 00:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

We shall use two theoretical contexts, namely that of classical\ncosmology and that of loop quantum cosmology. In the classical case, we\ninvestigated the existence and stability of fixed points, and as we will show,\nno de Sitter fixed points occur, however matter and radiation domination fixed\npoints occur, which are hyperbolic and unstable. We also show that there exist\nlimited sets of initial conditions for which singular solutions occur in the\nphase space. With regard to the loop quantum cosmology case, we demonstrate\nthat stable de Sitter fixed points exist, for some values of the free\nparameters of the theory, and interestingly enough, for the same values,\nsingular solutions corresponding to general sets of initial conditions occur.\nTo our knowledge this feature does not occur so frequently in loop quantum\ncosmological frameworks. We also demonstrate that non-singular solutions\ncorresponding to a general set of initial conditions occur, however these occur\nwhen the dark matter superfluid has negative pressure, so it is a rather\nphysically unappealing situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 16:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

The proof relies, among other things, on a new stability\nestimate for the inverse map $C_\\Phi \\to \\Phi$.\n  Key applications of our results are discussed in the case $n=3$ to\npolarimetric neutron tomography, see [Desai et al., Nature Sc.Rep. 2018] and\n[Hilger et al., Nature Comm. 2018]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 17:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 23:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 05:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Without\na means to deposit this energy into the SM, these models are often excluded.\nScenarios of \"neutral naturalness\" especially, such as the Twin Higgs\nfrequently suffer from this.\n  However, the Portalino, a singlet fermion that marries gauge neutral fermion\noperators, can naturally help provide a portal for entropy to return to the SM\nand to lift fermionic degrees of freedom in the Twin Sector.

However, recent works have shown that\ndeep networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which raised a\nserious robustness issue of deep networks. Adversarial training, typically\nformulated as a robust optimization problem, is an effective way of improving\nthe robustness of deep networks. A major drawback of existing adversarial\ntraining algorithms is the computational overhead of the generation of\nadversarial examples, typically far greater than that of the network training.\nThis leads to the unbearable overall computational cost of adversarial\ntraining. In this paper, we show that adversarial training can be cast as a\ndiscrete time differential game. Through analyzing the Pontryagin's Maximal\nPrinciple (PMP) of the problem, we observe that the adversary update is only\ncoupled with the parameters of the first layer of the network. This inspires us\nto restrict most of the forward and back propagation within the first layer of\nthe network during adversary updates. This effectively reduces the total number\nof full forward and backward propagation to only one for each group of\nadversary updates. Therefore, we refer to this algorithm YOPO (You Only\nPropagate Once). Numerical experiments demonstrate that YOPO can achieve\ncomparable defense accuracy with approximately 1/5 ~ 1/4 GPU time of the\nprojected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm.

The quotient $D$ confirms the previous result that smaller\ndistances exist with higher probability between the photometric galaxies and\nfilaments. The trend of smaller distances between the objects grows stronger at\nhigher redshift.

The line has been discussed as a possible\ndecay signature of 7.1 keV sterile neutrinos, which have been proposed as a\ndark matter (DM) candidate. We aim to further constrain the line strength and\nits implied mixing angle under the assumption that all DM is made of sterile\nneutrinos. The X-ray observations of the Limiting Window (LW) towards the\nGalactic bulge (GB) offer a unique dataset for exploring DM lines. We\ncharacterize the systematic uncertainties of the observation and the fitted\nmodels with simulated X-ray spectra. In addition we discuss uncertainties of\nindirect DM column density constraints towards the GB to understand systematic\nuncertainties in the assumed DM mass in the field of view of the observation.\nWe found tight constraints on the allowed flux for an additional line at 3.55\nkeV with a positive ($\\mathrm{\\sim1.5\\sigma}$) best fit value\n$\\mathrm{F_X^{3.55keV}\\approx(4.5\\pm3.5)\\times10^{-7}~cts~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.\nThis would translate into a mixing angle of\n$\\mathrm{sin^{2}(2\\Theta)\\approx(2.3\\pm1.8)\\times10^{-11}}$ which, while\nconsistent with some recent results, is in tension with earlier detections.

In order to quantitatively measure relevant turbulent\nparameters of the ISM, a wide variety of statistical techniques and metrics\nhave been developed that are often tested using numerical simulations and\nanalytic formalism. These metrics are typically based on the Fourier power\nspectrum, which does not capture the Fourier phase information that carries the\nmorphological characteristics of images. In this work we use density slices of\nmagnetohydrodyanmic turbulence simulations to demonstrate that a modern tool,\nconvolutional neural networks, can capture significant information encoded in\nthe Fourier phases. We train the neural network to distinguish between two\nsimulations with different levels of magnetization.

A theoretical formulation is developed for\nthe probability distribution function (PDF) of the density at steady state,\nconnecting it to the conditional statistics of the velocity divergence. Two\nsets of numerical simulations are carried out, using either a Riemann solver to\nevolve the Euler equations or a finite-difference method to evolve the\nNavier-Stokes (N-S) equations. After confirming the validity of our theoretical\nformulation with the N-S simulations, we examine the effects of dynamical\nprocesses on the PDF, showing that the nonlinear term in the divergence\nequation amplifies the right tail of the PDF and reduces the left one, the\npressure term reduces both the right and left tails, and the viscosity term,\ncounter-intuitively, broadens the right tail of the PDF. Despite the inaccuracy\nof the velocity divergence from the Riemann runs, as found in our previous\nwork, we show that the density PDF from the Riemann runs is consistent with\nthat from the N-S runs. Taking advantage of their much higher effective\nresolution, we then use the Riemann runs to study the dependence of the PDF on\nthe Mach number, $\\mathcal{M}$, up to $\\mathcal{M}\\sim30$. The PDF width,\n$\\sigma_{s}$, follows the relation $\\sigma_{s}^2 = \\ln (1+b^2 {\\mathcal M}^2)$,\nwith $b\\approx0.38$. However, the PDF exhibits a negative skewness that\nincreases with increasing $\\mathcal{M}$, so much of the growth of $\\sigma_{s}$\nis accounted for by the growth of the left PDF tail, while the growth of the\nright tail tends to saturate. Thus, the usual prescription that combines a\nlognormal shape with the standard variance-Mach number relation greatly\noverestimates the right PDF tail at large $\\mathcal{M}$, which may have a\nsignificant impact on theoretical models of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 18:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

From an information theoretical\nperspective, the overall network can be viewed as a generalization of the FD\nrelay broadcast channel with a side message transmitted from the relay to the\ndestination. We begin with a simpler case that involves the uplink and downlink\ntransmissions of $(m_1,m_2)$ only, and propose an achievable rate region based\non a novel strategy that uses the BS as a FD relay to facilitate the\ninterference cancellation at the downlink user.

This paper further studies a general setup wherein\n$(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ are communicated simultaneously. To account for the D2D\nmessage, we incorporate Marton's broadcast coding into the previous scheme to\nobtain a larger achievable rate region than the existing ones in the\nliterature.

Moreover, although odd-frequency can be induced\nby both the quantum impurity and the perturbation of the gap, we find these\nodd-frequency amplitudes emerge from entirely different kinds of scattering\nprocesses. The quantum impurity generates odd-frequency pairs by allowing one\nof the quasiparticles belonging to an equal-time Cooper pair to tunnel onto the\nimpurity state and then back to the superconductor, giving rise to\nodd-frequency amplitudes with a temporal broadening inversely proportional to\nthe energy level of the impurity.

In this paper, we propose a\nsocial perception scheme which treats all road participants as distributed\nsensors in a sensor network. By observing the individual behaviors as well as\nthe group behaviors, uncertainties of the three types can be updated uniformly\nin a belief space. The updated beliefs from the social perception are then\nexplicitly incorporated into a probabilistic planning framework based on Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). The cost function of the MPC is learned via inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL). Such an integrated probabilistic planning module\nwith socially enhanced perception enables the autonomous vehicles to generate\nbehaviors which are defensive but not overly conservative, and socially\ncompatible. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified in\nsimulation on an representative scenario with sensor occlusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 22:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

The output of this approach is two-fold. From the attacker point of\nview, a deep learning-based spoofing mechanism is trained to potentially fool a\ndefense mechanism such as RF fingerprinting. From the defender point of view, a\ndeep learning-based defense mechanism is trained against potential spoofing\nattacks when an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver cooperates. The\nprobability that the spoofing signal is misclassified as the intended signal is\nmeasured for random signal, replay, and GAN-based spoofing attacks. Results\nshow that the GAN-based spoofing attack provides a major increase in the\nsuccess probability of wireless signal spoofing even when a deep learning\nclassifier is used as the defense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 02:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 18:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

Thus it\nbecomes important to generate contextual sets of arbitrary structure and\ncomplexity to enable a variety of implementations. In recent years, such\ngeneration has been done for contextual sets known as Kochen-Specker sets. Up\nto now, two approaches have been used for massive generation of non-isomorphic\nKochen-Specker sets: exhaustive generation up to a given size and downward\ngeneration from master sets and their associated coordinatizations. Master sets\nwere obtained earlier from serendipitous or intuitive connections with\npolytopes or Pauli operators, and more recently from arbitrary vector\ncomponents using an algorithm that generates orthogonal vector groupings from\nthem. However, both upward and downward generation face an inherent exponential\ncomplexity barrier. In contrast, in this paper we present methods and\nalgorithms that we apply to downward generation that can overcome the\nexponential barrier in many cases of interest. These involve tailoring and\nmanipulating Kochen-Specker master sets obtained from a small number of simple\nvector components, filtered by the features of the sets we aim to obtain.

It enables the rapid distribution of content across the network,\nalleviating strain on content producers and reducing content delivery\nlatencies. ICN has emerged as a promising candidate for use in the Internet of\nThings (IoT). However, IoT devices operate under severe constraints, most\nnotably limited memory. This means that nodes cannot indiscriminately cache all\ncontent; instead, there is a need for a caching strategy that decides what\ncontent to cache. Furthermore, many applications in the IoT space are\ntimesensitive; therefore, finding a caching strategy that minimises the latency\nbetween content request and delivery is desirable. In this paper, we evaluate a\nnumber of ICN caching strategies in regards to latency and hop count reduction\nusing IoT devices in a physical testbed.

However, the proliferation of the IoT devices has raised the\nconcerns about their security, especially when observing that many\nmanufacturers focus only on the core functionality of their products due to\nshort time to market and low-cost pressures, while neglecting security aspects.\nMoreover, it does not exist any established or standardized method for\nmeasuring and ensuring the security of IoT devices. Consequently,\nvulnerabilities are left untreated, allowing attackers to exploit IoT devices\nfor various purposes, such as compromising privacy, recruiting devices into a\nbotnet, or misusing devices to perform cryptocurrency mining.\n  In this paper, we present a practical Host-based Anomaly DEtection System for\nIoT (HADES-IoT) that represents the last line of defense.

To improve the transient performance,\ndesired trajectories are passed through a group of cooperative filters to\ngenerate smooth reference signals, namely the states of the virtual leaders.\nModel uncertainties due to aerodynamic couplings among UAVs are estimated and\ncompensated using uncertainty and disturbance observers. The entire design,\ntherefore, contains three major components: cooperative filters for motion\nplanning, baseline cooperative control, and uncertainty and disturbance\nobservation.

Third, we design a graph iteration algorithm to assign the weight to\neach comment based on the degrees of the clustered subgraphs, which can\ndifferentiate the meaningful comments from the noises. Finally, we gain the\nweight of each word by combining Semantic Weight (SW) and Inverse Document\nFrequency (IDF). In this way, the video tags are extracted automatically in an\nunsupervised way. Extensive experiments have shown that SW-IDF (dialogue-based\nalgorithm) achieves 0.4210 F1-score and 0.4932 MAP (Mean Average Precision) in\nhigh-density comments, 0.4267 F1-score and 0.3623 MAP in low-density comments;\nwhile SW-IDF (topic center-based algorithm) achieves 0.4444 F1-score and 0.5122\nMAP in high-density comments, 0.4207 F1-score and 0.3522 MAP in low-density\ncomments. It has a better performance than the state-of-the-art unsupervised\nalgorithms in both F1-score and MAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 07:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

One possibility to include temporal\ninformation is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few\napproaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far.

Procedures for FCR control exist in the\noffline setting, but none so far have been designed with the online setting in\nmind. In the online setting, there is an infinite sequence of fixed unknown\nparameters $\\theta_t$ ordered by time. At each step, we see independent data\nthat is informative about $\\theta_t$, and must immediately make a decision\nwhether to report a CI for $\\theta_t$ or not. If $\\theta_t$ is selected for\ncoverage, the task is to determine how to construct a CI for $\\theta_t$ such\nthat $\\text{FCR} \\leq \\alpha$ for any $T\\in \\mathbb{N}$. A straightforward\nsolution is to construct at each step a $(1-\\alpha)$ level conditional CI. In\nthis paper, we present a novel solution to the problem inspired by online false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) algorithms, which only requires the statistician to be\nable to construct a marginal CI at any given level. Apart from the fact that\nmarginal CIs are usually simpler to construct than conditional ones, the\nmarginal procedure has an important qualitative advantage over the conditional\nsolution, namely, it allows selection to be determined by the candidate CI\nitself. We take advantage of this to offer solutions to some online problems\nwhich have not been addressed before. For example, we show that our general CI\nprocedure can be used to devise online sign-classification procedures that\ncontrol the false sign rate (FSR). In terms of power and length of the\nconstructed CIs, we demonstrate that the two approaches have complementary\nstrengths and weaknesses using simulations.

This\nproposed route could be extended to other oxide heterostructures, providing a\nplatform for creating exotic phases and emergent phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 08:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 01:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

The prevalent\napproach is to map an input video to a variable-length output sentence in a\nsequence to sequence manner via Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Nevertheless,\nthe training of RNN still suffers to some degree from vanishing/exploding\ngradient problem, making the optimization difficult. Moreover, the inherently\nrecurrent dependency in RNN prevents parallelization within a sequence during\ntraining and therefore limits the computations. In this paper, we present a\nnovel design --- Temporal Deformable Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Networks\n(dubbed as TDConvED) that fully employ convolutions in both encoder and decoder\nnetworks for video captioning. Technically, we exploit convolutional block\nstructures that compute intermediate states of a fixed number of inputs and\nstack several blocks to capture long-term relationships. The structure in\nencoder is further equipped with temporal deformable convolution to enable\nfree-form deformation of temporal sampling. Our model also capitalizes on\ntemporal attention mechanism for sentence generation. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on both MSVD and MSR-VTT video captioning datasets, and superior\nresults are reported when comparing to conventional RNN-based encoder-decoder\ntechniques.

In\nthis work, we present an ab-initio study based on density functional theory of\nbias-induced atomic forces in gated graphene nanoconstrictions consisting of\njunctions between graphene electrodes and graphene nano-ribbons in the presence\nof current. We find that current-induced bond-forces and bond-charges are\ncorrelated, while bond-forces are not simply correlated to bond-currents. We\ndiscuss, in particular, how the forces are related to induced charges and the\nelectrostatic potential profile (voltage drop) across the junctions. For long\ncurrent-carrying junctions we may separate the junction into a part with a\nvoltage drop, and a part without voltage drop. The latter situation can be\ncompared to a nano-ribbon in the presence of current using an ideal ballistic\nvelocity-dependent occupation function. This shows how the combination of\nvoltage drop and current give rise to the strongest current-induced forces in\nnanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 10:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

To\naccomplish this goal it must learn to output the appropriate classification\nweight vectors for those two types of classes. To build our meta-model we make\nuse of two main innovations: we propose the use of a Denoising Autoencoder\nnetwork (DAE) that (during training) takes as input a set of classification\nweights corrupted with Gaussian noise and learns to reconstruct the\ntarget-discriminative classification weights. In this case, the injected noise\non the classification weights serves the role of regularizing the weight\ngenerating meta-model. Furthermore, in order to capture the co-dependencies\nbetween different classes in a given task instance of our meta-model, we\npropose to implement the DAE model as a Graph Neural Network (GNN).

Even in the point-particle limit, neutron halo nuclei have a finite\ncharge radius, because their center of mass does not coincide with their center\nof charge. This point-particle contribution decreases as $1/A_c$, where $A_c$\nis the mass number of the core, and diminishes in importance compared to other\neffects, e.g., the size of the core to which the neutrons are bound. Here we\npropose that for heavy cores the EFT expansion should account for the small\nfactors of $1/A_c$. As a specific example, we discuss the implications of this\norganizational scheme for the inclusion of finite-size effects in expressions\nfor the charge radii of halo nuclei. We show in particular that a short-range\noperator could be the dominant effect in the charge radius of one-neutron halos\nbound by a P-wave interaction. The point-particle contribution remains the\nleading piece of the charge radius for one-proton halos, and so Halo EFT has\nmore predictive power in that case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 10:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 22:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The generalized model\ndescribes spherocylindrical micelles, which are simultaneously multicomponent\nand polydisperse in size. Theory: The model is based on explicit analytical\nexpressions for the four components of the free energy of mixed nonionic\nmicelles: interfacial-tension, headgroup-steric, chain-conformation components\nand free energy of mixing. The radii of the cylindrical part and the spherical\nendcaps, as well as the chemical composition of the endcaps, are determined by\nminimization of the free energy. Findings: In the case of multicomponent\nmicelles, an additional term appears in the expression for the micelle growth\nparameter (scission free energy), which takes into account the fact that the\nmicelle endcaps and cylindrical part have different compositions. The model\naccurately predicts the mean mass aggregation number of wormlike micelles in\nmixed nonionic surfactant solutions without using any adjustable parameters.\nThe endcaps are enriched in the surfactant with smaller packing parameter that\nis better accommodated in regions of higher mean surface curvature. The model\ncan be further extended to mixed solutions of nonionic, ionic and zwitterionic\nsurfactants used in personal-care and house-hold detergency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 10:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Group emotion recognition is a\nchallenging problem due to obstructions like head and body pose variations,\nocclusions, variable lighting conditions, variance of actors, varied indoor and\noutdoor settings and image quality. The objective of this task is to classify a\ngroup's perceived emotion as Positive, Neutral or Negative. In this report, we\ndescribe our solution which is a hybrid machine learning system that\nincorporates deep neural networks and Bayesian classifiers. Deep Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) work from bottom to top, analysing facial expressions\nexpressed by individual faces extracted from the image.

It is of particular interest to develop an\nSOT-MRAM device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in order to\nleverage the greater density and thermal stability achievable with PMA as\nopposed to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. However, the orthogonality between SOT\nand PMA prevents deterministic directional switching without an additional\ndevice component that breaks the symmetry, such as an external magnetic field\nor complex physical structure; not only do these components complicate\nfabrication, they also are not robust to variations in fabrication and applied\nswitching current. This letter therefore proposes a simple SOT-MRAM structure\nwith PMA in which deterministic toggle switching is achieved without requiring\nadditional device components. Furthermore, this toggle PMA SOT-MRAM is shown to\nbe far more robust than previous approaches for directional PMA SOT-MRAM, with\ngreater than 50% tolerance to applied switching current magnitude. This letter\ndescribes the physical structure and toggle switching mechanism, provides\nmicromagnetic simulations demonstrating its feasibility, and evaluates the\nrobustness and tolerance to material parameters to guide the fabrication of\noptimized devices that will jumpstart the third generation of MRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 11:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

The system is in thermal equilibrium at the inverse\ntemperature $\\beta$, its thermodynamics depends only on the coupling constant\n$\\Gamma=\\beta e^2$. We put into an infinite (homogeneous and translationally\ninvariant) plasma a guest particle of charge $Ze$ with $Z>-2/\\Gamma$ in order\nto prevent from the collapse of the jellium charges onto it. The guest particle\ninduces a screening cloud (the excess charge density) in the plasma. The zeroth\nand second moments of this screening cloud were derived previously for any\nfluid value of $\\Gamma$. In this paper, we propose a formula for the fourth\nmoment of the screening cloud. The derivation is based on the assumption that\nthe fourth moment is, similarly as the second moment, analytic in $Z$ around\n$Z=0$. An exact treatment of the limit $Z\\to\\infty$ shows that it is a finite\n(cube) polynomial in $Z$. The $\\Gamma$-dependence of the polynomial\ncoefficients is determined uniquely by considering the limits $Z\\to 0$ and\n$Z\\to\\infty$, and the compressibility sum rule for $Z=1$.

Beginning with the\nconstruction of the generating functional of the theory, we describe in detail\nhow the theory needs to be adapted to reflect the expanding spatial background\nand the homogeneous and isotropic, correlated initial conditions for cosmic\nstructures. Based on the generating functional, we develop three main\napproaches to non-linear, late-time cosmic structures, which rest either on the\nTaylor expansion of an interaction operator, suitable averaging procedures for\nthe interaction term, or a resummation of perturbation terms. We show how an\nanalytic, parameter-free equation for the non-linear cosmic power spectrum can\nbe derived.\n  We explain how the theory can be used to derive the density profile of\ngravitationally bound structures and use it to derive power spectra of cosmic\nvelocity densities. We further clarify how KFT relates to the BBGKY hierarchy.\nWe then proceed to apply kinetic field theory to fluids, introduce a\nreformulation of KFT in terms of macroscopic quantities which leads to a\nresummation scheme, and use this to describe mixtures of gas and dark matter.\nWe discuss how KFT can be applied to study cosmic structure formation with\nmodified theories of gravity. As an example for an application to a\nnon-cosmological particle ensemble, we show results on the spatial correlation\nfunction of cold Rydberg atoms derived from KFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 13:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We\ndemonstrate the capability of the proposed methods via several numerical\nexamples: (1) A linear stochastic advection equation with deterministic initial\ncondition where the original DO/BO method would fail; (2) Long-time integration\nof the stochastic Burgers' equation with many eigenvalue crossings during the\nwhole time evolution where the original BO method fails.

Although\nMatlab is more convenient in developing and data presentation, OpenCV is much\nfaster in execution, where the speed ratio reaches more than 80 in some cases.\nThe best of two worlds can be achieved by exploring using Matlab or similar\nenvironments to select the most successful algorithm; then, implementing the\nselected algorithm using OpenCV or similar environments to gain a speed factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 14:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 14:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 12:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

We formulate the problem as an optimal control problem\nand incorporate the information on the sparsity of the unknown initial data\ninto the structure of the objective functional.

There have been\ntremendous strides in efficiency over the past ten years, yet 2P-SFE protocols\nremain impractical for most real-time, online computations, particularly on\nmodestly provisioned devices. Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides\nhardware-protected execution environments, called enclaves, that may be viewed\nas trusted computation oracles.

As an alternative to\ntobacco, the use of electronic cigarettes (ECig) has been increased\ndramatically over the last decade. ECig use is hypothesized to impact smoking\nbehavior through several pathways, not only as a means of quitting cigarettes\nand lowering risk of relapse, but also as both an alternative nicotine delivery\ndevice to cigarettes, as a visible use of nicotine that can lead to imitative\nbehavior in the form of smoking, and as a gateway nicotine delivery technology\nthat can build high levels of nicotine tolerance and pave the way for\ninitiation of smoking. Evidence regarding the effect of ECig use on smoking\nbehavior change remains inconclusive. To address these challenges, we built an\nagent-based model (ABM) of smoking and ECig use to examine the effects of ECig\nuse on smoking behavior change. The impact of social network (SN) on the\ninitiation of smoking and ECig use were also explored. Findings from the\nsimulation suggest that the use of ECig generates substantially lower\nprevalence of current smoker (PCS), which demonstrates the potential for\nreducing smoking and lowering the risk of relapse. The effects of\nproximity-based influences within SN increases the prevalence of current ECig\nuser (PCEU). The model also suggests the importance of improved understanding\nof drivers in cessation and relapse in ECig use, in light of findings that such\naspects of behavior change may notably influence smoking behavior change and\nburden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 01:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

The\nBohr model of the Hydrogen atom is thought of in terms of an indeterministic\nelectron position and a deterministic metric and the motivation for this paper\nis to try to change variables to have a deterministic position and momentum for\nthe electron and nucleus but with an indeterministic (quantum) metric that\nreproduces the physics of the Bohr model. This mapping is achieved by allowing\nthe metric in the Hamiltonian to be different to the metric in the space-time\ndistance element and then representing the two metrics with vierbeins and\nassuming they are canonically conjugate variables. Effectively, the usual\nSchr\\\"odinger space-time variables have been re-interpreted as four of the\npotentially sixteen parameters of the metric tensor vierbein in the distance\nelement while the metric tensor vierbein in the Hamiltonian is an operator\nexpressible as first-order derivatives in these variables or vice versa. I then\nargue that this reproduces observed quantum physics at the sub-atomic level by\ndemonstrating the energy spectrum of electron orbitals is exactly the same as\nthe usual relativistic Bohr model for the Hydrogen atom in a certain limit.\nNext, by introducing a single dimensionless running coupling that shows up in\nthe analogous place as, but in addition to, Planck's constant in the commutator\ndefinition I argue that this allows massive objects to couple to the physical\nspace-time geometry but not massless ones - no matter coupling value. This\nclaim is based on a fit to the Schwarzschild metric with a few simple\nassumptions and thus obtaining an effective theory of how the quantum\ngeometries at nearby space-time points couple to one another.
