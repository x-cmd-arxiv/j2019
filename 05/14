One way of overcoming limited\nconnectivity is to insert swaps in the circuit so that logical operations can\nbe performed on physically adjacent qubits, which we refer to as solving the\n`routing via matchings' problem. We address the routing problem for families of\nquantum circuits defined by a hypergraph wherein each hyperedge corresponds to\na potential gate. Our main result is that any unordered set of $k$-qubit gates\non distinct $k$-qubit subsets of $n$ logical qubits can be ordered and\nparallelized in $O(n^{k-1})$ depth using a linear arrangement of $n$ physical\nqubits; the construction is completely general and achieves optimal scaling in\nthe case where gates acting on all $\\binom{n}{k}$ sets of $k$ qubits are\ndesired. We highlight two classes of problems for which our method is\nparticularly useful. First, it applies to sets of mutually commuting gates, as\nin the (diagonal) phase separators of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz\n(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits. For example, a single\nlevel of a QAOA circuit for Maximum Cut can be implemented in linear depth, and\na single level for $3$-SAT in quadratic depth. Second, it applies to sets of\ngates that do not commute but for which compilation efficiency is the dominant\ncriterion in their ordering. In particular, it can be adapted to Trotterized\ntime-evolution of fermionic Hamiltonians under the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation, and also to non-standard mixers in QAOA. Using our method, a\nsingle Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in an arbitrary\nbasis of $n$ orbitals can be done in $O(n^3)$ depth while a Trotter step of the\nunitary coupled cluster singles and doubles method can be implemented in $O(n^2\n\\eta)$ depth, where $\\eta$ is the number of electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 16:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Many modern systems\nbeamform with antenna arrays for this purpose. However, a radio's ability to\ndirect its signal is fundamentally limited by its size. Unfortunately practical\nchallenges limit the size of modern radios, and consequently, their ability to\nbeamform. In many settings, radios on devices must be small and inexpensive;\ntoday, these settings are unable to benefit from high-precision beamforming.\n  To address this problem, we introduce RFocus, which moves beamforming\nfunctions from the radio endpoints to the environment. RFocus includes a\ntwo-dimensional surface with a rectangular array of simple elements, each of\nwhich functions as an RF switch. Each element either lets the signal through or\nreflects it. The surface does not emit any power of its own. The state of the\nelements is set by a software controller to maximize the signal strength at a\nreceiver, with a novel optimization algorithm that uses signal strength\nmeasurements from the receiver. The RFocus surface can be manufactured as an\ninexpensive thin wallpaper, requiring no wiring. This solution requires only a\nmethod to communicate received signal strengths periodically to the RFocus\ncontroller. Our prototype implementation improves the median signal strength by\n10.5x, and the median channel capacity by 2.1x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 16:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

In fact, poor decentralization\nappears not only in PoW-based coins but also in coins adopting other mechanisms\nsuch as proof-of-stake (PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). In this\npaper, we target this centralization issue.

However, to achieve this, the blockchain system should be\nable to assign a positive Sybil cost, where the Sybil cost is defined as the\ndifference between the cost for one participant running multiple nodes and the\ntotal cost for multiple participants each running one node. On the other hand,\nwe prove that when there is no Sybil cost, the probability of reaching (m,\n\\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization is upper bounded by a value close to 0,\nconsidering a large rich-poor gap.

The formalism for the calculation of the transverse momenta spectra in\nCGC/saturation approach is developed, in which two stages of the process are\nseen: creation of the colour glass condensate, and hadronization of the gluon\njets.

Due to the relatively large mass of the\ninflaton field, such a portal leads to an extremely feeble interaction between\nthe dark and the visible sectors suggesting that the dark sector cannot reach\nany thermal equilibrium with the visible sector. After the two sectors are\npopulated by the decay of the inflaton, a heavy dark-matter particle thermally\ndecouples within the dark sector. Later, a lighter dark particle, whose decay\nwidth is naturally suppressed by the inflaton propagator, decays into the\nvisible sector after it dominates the energy density of universe. This process\ndilutes the dark-matter relic density by injecting entropy in the visible\nsector. We show that an inflaton mass of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{13})$ GeV together\nwith couplings of order one are fully compatible with a dark-matter relic\nabundance $\\Omega h^2\\sim 0.1$. As a general feature of the model, the entropy\ndilution mechanism is accompanied by a period of early matter domination, which\nmodifies the amount of e-folds of inflation necessary to accommodate Planck\ndata. Moreover, the coupling of the inflaton to the dark and visible sectors\nbrings loop contributions to the inflationary potential which can destabilize\nthe inflation trajectory.

Motivated by the success of this model, we investigate in\ndetail the physical origins and evolution of these scaling relations. The ratio\nof the combined mass in GCs $M_{\\rm GC}$ to the host dark matter halo mass\n$M_h$ is nearly constant at all redshifts, but its normalization evolves by a\nfactor of $\\sim$10 from birth to $z=0$. The relation is steeper than linear at\nhalo masses $M_h \\lesssim 10^{11.5} M_{\\odot}$, primarily due to non-linearity\nin the stellar mass-halo mass relation. The near constancy of the ratio $M_{\\rm\nGC}/M_h$, combined with the shape of the stellar mass-halo mass relation, sets\nthe characteristic $U-$shape of the GC specific frequency as a function of host\ngalaxy mass. The contribution of accreted satellite galaxies to the buildup of\nGC systems is a strong function of the host galaxy mass, ranging from\n$\\approx$0% at $M_h \\approx 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ to 80% at $M_h \\approx 10^{15}\nM_{\\odot}$.

At the scale\n$\\zeta_2:=2\\,$GeV, the following momentum fractions are predicted: $\\langle\nx_{\\rm valence} \\rangle = 0.48(3)$, $\\langle x_{\\rm glue} \\rangle = 0.41(2)$,\n$\\langle x_{\\rm sea} \\rangle = 0.11(2)$. Evolving to $\\zeta=5.2\\,$GeV, the\nresult for ${q}^\\pi(x)$ agrees with that computed using lattice QCD. These\noutcomes should both spur improved analyses of existing experiments and\nstimulate efforts to obtain new data on the pion distribution functions using\navailable and envisioned facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 18:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 05:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

However, it is not clear\nhow star-forming (SF) bars fit into this picture and how the dynamical state of\nthe bar is related to other properties of the host galaxy. We used\nintegral-field spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE to investigate how star formation\nwithin bars is connected to structural properties of the bar and the host\ngalaxy. We derived spatially resolved H$\\alpha$ fluxes from MUSE observations\nfrom the CARS survey to estimate star formation rates in the bars of 16 nearby\n($0.01 < z < 0.06$) disc galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{10} M_\\odot$\nand $10^{11} M_\\odot$. We further performed a detailed multicomponent\nphotometric decomposition on images derived from the data cubes. We find that\nbars clearly divide into SF and non-star-forming (non-SF) types, of which eight\nare SF and eight are non-SF. Whatever the responsible quenching mechanism is,\nit is a quick process compared to the lifetime of the bar.

Their proofs proceed by manipulations of\ndeterminants underlying the characters. The purpose of the current paper is to\nprovide bijective proofs of such factorizations. The quantities involved have\nknown combinatorial interpretations in terms of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns of\nvarious types or half Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, which can in turn be\ntransformed into perfect matchings of weighted trapezoidal honeycomb graphs. An\nimportant ingredient is then Ciucu's theorem for graphs with reflective\nsymmetry.

This procedure\nis based on a \"randomized\" bijection, which can however also be turned into a\nclassical bijection.

The proposed model is based on the\nKindlmann and Dixon set of differential equations, focused on the prediction of\nthe aphids-ladybirds population densities, that share a prey-predator\nrelationship. The population of ants, in mutualistic relationship with aphids\nand in interspecific competition with ladybirds, is described according to the\nHolland and De Angelis mathematical model, in which the authors faced the\nproblem of mutualistic interactions in general terms. The set of differential\nequations proposed here is discretized by means the Nonstandard Finite\nDifference scheme, successfully applied by Gabbriellini to the mutualistic\nmodel. The constructed finite-difference scheme is positivity-preserving and\ncharacterized by four nonhyperbolic steady-states, as highlighted by the\nphase-space and time-series analyses. Particular attention is dedicated to the\nsteady-state most interesting from an ecological point of view, whose\nasymptotic stability is demonstrated via the Centre Manifold Theory. The model\nallows to numerically confirm that mutualistic relationship effectively\ninfluences the population dynamic, by increasing the peaks of the aphids and\nants population densities. Nonetheless, it is showed that the asymptotical\npopulations of aphids and ladybirds collapse for any initial condition, unlike\nthat of ants that, after the peak, settle on a constant asymptotic value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 19:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

We demonstrate here the all-optical generation of\ntrains of attosecond free-electron pulses. The concept is based on the periodic\nenergy modulation of a pulsed electron beam via an inelastic interaction with\nthe ponderomotive potential of an optical travelling wave generated by two\nfemtosecond laser pulses at different frequencies in vacuum. The subsequent\ndispersive propagation leads to a compression of the electrons and the\nformation of ultrashort pulses. The longitudinal phase space evolution of the\nelectrons after compression is mapped by a second phase-locked interaction.

MEC aims at bringing delay-sensitive applications closer to the\nradio access network to enable ultra-low latency for users and decrease the\nback-haul pressure on mobile service providers.

By applying the lubrication approximation,\nthin shell elastic model, as well as scaling analysis and regular and singular\nasymptotic schemes, the problem is examined for small and large deformation\nlimits (relative to the gap between the cylinder and the tube). At the limit of\nlarge deformations, forced insertion of the cylinder is shown to involve three\ndistinct regimes and time-scales: (i) initial shear dominant regime, (ii)\nintermediate regime of dominant fluidic pressure and a propagating\nviscous-peeling front, (iii) late-time quasi-steady flow regime of the fully\npeeled tube. A uniform solution for all regimes is presented for a suddenly\napplied constant force, showing initial deceleration and then acceleration of\nthe inserted cylinder. For the case of forced extraction of the cylinder from\nthe tube, the negative gauge pressure reduces the gap between the cylinder and\nthe tube, increasing viscous resistance or creating friction due to contact of\nthe tube and cylinder. Matched asymptotic schemes are used to calculate the\ndynamics of the near-contact and contact limits. We find that the cylinder\nexits the tube in a finite time for sufficiently small or large forces.\nHowever, for an intermediate range of forces the radial contact creates a\nsteady locking of the cylinder inside the tube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 20:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

However, the ocean acoustic\ncommunication channel exhibits strong amplitude and phase fluctuations and the\nphenomena of diffraction, refraction and reflection. Due to the complexity of\nthe environment, the motions of transducers, sea surface, etc., the underwater\nacoustic signals exhibit random temporal and spatial frequency fluctuations in\nboth amplitude and phase. Therefore, it is very important to model a so complex\nchannel. Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors:\nattenuation that increases with signal frequency, time-varying multipath\npropagation, and low speed of sound (1500 m/s).

The addition of a Bi\nflux during InAs deposition changes the InAs growth mode from two-dimensional\n(2D) Frank-van der Merwe to Stranski-Krastanov, resulting in the formation of\nthree-dimensional (3D) InAs islands on the surface. Furthermore, exposing\nstatic InAs 2D layers to Bi induces a rearrangement of the strained layer into\n3D islands. We explore the effect of varying the InAs thickness and Bi flux for\nthese two growth approaches, observing a critical thickness for 3D island\nformation in both cases. Characterization of (110) InAs quantum dots with\nhigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that larger islands\ngrown by the Stranski-Krastanov mode are plastically relaxed, while small\nislands grown by the on-demand approach are coherent. Strain relaxation along\nthe [1-10] direction is achieved by 90 degree pure-edge dislocations with\ndislocation lines running along [001].

For synthetic networks on a lattice, we predict the search time\ndependence on these global structural parameters by connecting with percolation\ntheory, providing a bridge from irregular real-world networks to a simpler\nphysical model. The dependence of search time on global network structural\nproperties suggests that network architecture can be designed for efficient\nsearch without controlling the precise arrangement of connections.\nSpecifically, increasing the number of loops substantially decreases search\ntimes, pointing to a potential physical mechanism for regulating reaction rates\nwithin organelle network structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 23:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 18:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

Therefore, recent observations of QOs in insulating\nSmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$, in particular the QOs of the resistivity $\\rho_{xx}$ in\nYbB$_{12}$, have been a big surprise, pointing to the formation of a novel\nstate of quantum matter. Despite the large charge gap inferred from the\ninsulating behaviour of $\\rho_{xx}$, these compounds seemingly host a Fermi\nsurface at high magnetic fields. However, the nature of the ground state in\nzero field has been little explored. Here we report the use of low-temperature\nheat-transport measurements to discover gapless, itinerant, charge-neutral\nexcitations in the ground state of YbB$_{12}$. At zero field, despite\n$\\rho_{xx}$ being far larger than that of conventional metals, a sizable linear\ntemperature dependent term in the thermal conductivity is clearly resolved in\nthe zero-temperature limit\n($\\kappa_{xx}/T(T\\rightarrow0)=\\kappa_{xx}^0/T\\neq0$).

These data indicate that YbB$_{12}$ is a charge\ninsulator but a thermal metal, suggesting the presence of itinerant neutral\nfermions. Remarkably, more insulating crystals with larger activation energies\nexhibit a larger amplitude of the resistive QOs as well as a larger\n$\\kappa_{xx}^0/T$, in stark contrast to conventional metals.

However, in Japanese historical\ndocuments, not only contains the mentioned problems, pre-modern Japanese\ncharacters were written in cursive and are connected. Therefore, character\nsegmentation based methods do not work well. This leads to the idea of creating\na new recognition system. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired document\nreading system to recognize multiple lines of premodern Japanese historical\ndocuments. During the reading, people employ eyes movement to determine the\nstart of a text line. Then, they move the eyes from the current character/word\nto the next character/word. They can also determine the end of a line or skip a\nfigure to move to the next line. The eyes movement integrates with visual\nprocessing to operate the reading process in the brain. We employ\nattention-based encoder-decoder to implement this recognition system. First,\nthe recognition system detects where to start a text line. Second, the system\nscans and recognize character by character until the text line is completed.\nThen, the system continues to detect the start of the next text line. This\nprocess is repeated until reading the whole document. We tested our\nhuman-inspired recognition system on the pre-modern Japanese historical\ndocument provide by the PRMU Kuzushiji competition.

There appears to be a fundamental tradeoff between the computational\ncomplexity of the switching algorithm and the resultants throughput and delay.\nParallel maximal matching algorithms (adapted for switching) appear to have\nstricken a sweet spot in this tradeoff, and prior work has shown the following\nperformance guarantees.

Existing\nmethods either prepend history turns to the current question or use complicated\nattention mechanisms to model the history. We propose a conceptually simple yet\nhighly effective approach referred to as history answer embedding. It enables\nseamless integration of conversation history into a conversational question\nanswering (ConvQA) model built on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers). We first explain our view that ConvQA is a simplified but\nconcrete setting of conversational search, and then we provide a general\nframework to solve ConvQA. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach under this framework. Finally, we analyze the impact of different\nnumbers of history turns under different settings to provide new insights into\nconversation history modeling in ConvQA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 06:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 14:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

The kinematic age of 1 x\n10^7 year of the jet activity is consistent with the expected NLS1 phase of\n~10^7 year in the AGN lifetime. The VLBA image reveals the jet structure at\ndistances ranging from r=0.82 milliarcsec to 3.5 milliarcsec, corresponding to\napproximately 100 pc, where superluminal motions were found. The jet width\nprofile ($\\propto r^{1.12}$) and flux-density profile ($\\propto r^{-1.44}$)\ndepending on the distance $r$ along the jet suggest that the jet kinetic energy\nis converted into internal energy in this region.

To mitigate cycle skipping, wavefield\nreconstruction inversion (WRI) extends the inversion search space by computing\nwavefields with a relaxation of the wave equation in order to fit the data from\nthe first iteration. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated by minimizing\nthe source residuals the relaxation generated. Capitalizing on the\nwave-equation bilinearity, performing wavefield reconstruction and parameter\nestimation in alternating mode decomposes WRI into two linear subproblems,\nwhich can solved efficiently with the alternating-direction method of\nmultiplier (ADMM), leading to the so-called IR-WRI. Moreover, ADMM provides a\nsuitable framework to implement bound constraints and different types of\nregularizations and their mixture in IR-WRI. Here, IR-WRI is extended to\nmultiparameter reconstruction for VTI acoustic media. To achieve this goal, we\nfirst propose different forms of bilinear VTI acoustic wave equation. We\ndevelop more specifically IR-WRI for the one that relies on a parametrisation\ninvolving vertical wavespeed and Thomsen's parameters delta and epsilon. With a\ntoy numerical example, we first show that the radiation patterns of the virtual\nsources generate similar wavenumber filtering and parameter cross-talks in\nclassical FWI and IR-WRI. Bound constraints and TV regularization in IR-WRI\nfully remove these undesired effects for an idealized piecewise constant\ntarget. We show with a more realistic long-offset case study representative of\nthe North Sea that anisotropic IR-WRI successfully reconstruct the vertical\nwavespeed starting from a laterally homogeneous model and update the\nlong-wavelengths of the starting epsilon model, while a smooth delta model is\nused as a passive background model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 08:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 12:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Finally, we measure the conductance\nmatrix as a function of magnetic field and identify correlated splittings in\nlow-energy features, demonstrating how conductance-matrix measurements can\ncomplement traditional tunneling-probe measurements in the search for Majorana\nzero modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 10:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

In FD-MIMO, with a large number of antennae at the base\nstation and the ability to perform beamforming, the capacity of the physical\ndownlink shared channel (PDSCH) has increased a lot. However, the current\nspecifications of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) does not allow\nthe base station to perform beamforming techniques for the physical downlink\ncontrol channel (PDCCH), and hence, PDCCH has neither the capacity nor the\ncoverage of PDSCH.

A configuration is a state and a value for each counter; a\ntransition changes the state and each counter is incremented, decremented, or\nleft unchanged. While qualitative properties such as state and configuration\nreachability have been studied for VASS, we consider the long-run average cost\nof infinite computations of VASS. The cost of a configuration is for each\nstate, a linear combination of the counter values. In the special case of\nuniform cost functions, the linear combination is the same for all states. The\n(regular) long-run emptiness problem is, given a VASS, a cost function, and a\nthreshold value, if there is a (lasso-shaped) computation such that the\nlong-run average value of the cost function does not exceed the threshold. For\nuniform cost functions, we show that the regular long-run emptiness problem is\n(a)~decidable in polynomial time for integer-valued VASS, and (b)~decidable but\nnonelementarily hard for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters). For\ngeneral cost functions, we show that the problem is (c)~NP-complete for\ninteger-valued VASS, and (d)~undecidable for natural-valued VASS. Our most\ninteresting result is for (c) integer-valued VASS with general cost functions,\nwhere we establish a connection between the regular long-run emptiness problem\nand quadratic Diophantine inequalities. The general (nonregular) long-run\nemptiness problem is equally hard as the regular problem in all cases except\n(c), where it remains open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 12:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

The magnetic field strength in\nthe source, $B\\approx 5\\times 10^{11}$ G, is known from the cyclotron\nabsorption feature discovered in the energy spectrum around 4.5 keV. Here, we\nexplore the flux variability of the source in context of interaction of its\nmagnetosphere with the radiation-pressure dominated accretion disk.\nParticularly, we present the results of the analysis of noise power density\nspectra (PDS) using the observations of the source in 1996-1997 by RXTE.\nAccreting compact objects commonly exhibit a broken power-law shape of the PDS\nwith a break corresponding to the Keplerian orbital frequency of matter at the\ninnermost disk radius. The observed frequency of the break can thus be used to\nestimate the size of the magnetosphere. We found, however, that the observed\nPDS of GRO J1744-28 differs dramatically from the canonical shape. Furthermore,\nthe observed break frequency appears to be significantly higher than what is\nexpected based on the magnetic field estimated from the cyclotron line energy.\nWe argue that these observational facts can be attributed to the existence of\nthe radiation-pressure dominated region in the accretion disk at luminosities\nabove $\\sim$2$\\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We discuss a qualitative model for\nthe PDS formation in such disks, and show that its predictions are consistent\nwith our observational findings.

Fractional damping is a particular instance of non-local\n(in time) damping, which is ubiquitous in mechanical engineering applications.\nThe restricted Hamilton's principle relies on including fractional derivatives\nto the state space, the doubling of curves (which implies an extra mirror\nsystem) and the restriction of the class of varied curves. We will obtain the\ncorrect dynamics, and will show rigorously that the extra mirror dynamics is\nnothing but the main one in reversed time; thus, the restricted Hamilton's\nprinciple is not adding extra physics to the original system. The price to pay,\non the other hand, is that the fractional damped dynamics is only a sufficient\ncondition for the extremals of the action. In addition, we proceed to\ndiscretise the new principle. This discretisation provides a set of numerical\nintegrators for the continuous dynamics that we denote Fractional Variational\nIntegrators (FVIs). The discrete dynamics is obtained upon the same\ningredients, say doubling of discrete curves and restriction of the discrete\nvariations. We display the performance of the FVIs, which have local truncation\norder 1, in two examples.

In the JPEG bitstream, not all the variable length codes (VLC) are\nused to encode image data. By constructing the mapping between the used and\nunused VLCs, the secret data can be embedded by replacing the used VLC with the\nunused VLC. Different from the previous schemes, our mapping strategy allows\nthe lengths of unused and used VLCs in a mapping set to be unequal. We present\nsome basic insights into the construction of the mapping relationship.\nExperimental results show that most of the JPEG images using the proposed\nscheme obtain smaller file size increments than previous RDH schemes.\nFurthermore, the proposed scheme can obtain high embedding capacity while\nkeeping the marked JPEG image with no distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 14:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 02:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

However,\nunlike real life in which advice is a recommendation that we can choose to\nfollow or to ignore based on trustworthiness, in the current advice model, the\nonline algorithm treats it as infallible. This means that if the advice is\ncorrupt or, worse, if it comes from a malicious source, the algorithm may\nperform poorly. In this work, we study online computation in a setting in which\nthe advice is provided by an untrusted source. Our objective is to quantify the\nimpact of untrusted advice so as to design and analyze online algorithms that\nare robust and perform well even when the advice is generated in a malicious,\nadversarial manner. To this end, we focus on well- studied online problems such\nas ski rental, online bidding, bin packing, and list update.

From these facts, it is naturally inferred that the weak scale is\ndetermined by some dynamics from the Planck scale. In order to answer this\nquestion, we rely on the multiple point criticality principle as a clue and\nconsider the classically conformal $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant\ntwo scalar model as a minimal model in which the weak scale is generated\ndynamically from the Planck scale.

Existing methods either lack\nin taking these BIPs into account - questionnaires - or are complex in their\napplication and evaluation - physiological and behavioral measures -. To\nprovide a practical approach, we propose a post-experience method in which the\nusers reflect on their experience by drawing a line, indicating their\nexperienced state of presence, in a paper-based drawing template. The amplitude\nof the drawn line represents the variation of their presence experience over\ntime.

The descriptive model enables us to objectively\nevaluate user drawings and represent the course of the drawings by a defined\nset of parameters. An exploratory user study (N=30) showed that the drawings\nare very consistent, the method can detect all BIPs and shows good indications\nfor representing the intensity of a BIP.

The service quality of a firm - from the perspective of a\ncustomer - depends on the congestion and the charged price. A firm can set a\nprice for the service offered and additionally decides on the service capacity\nin order to mitigate congestion. The total profit of a firm is derived from the\ngained revenue minus the capacity investment cost. Firms simultaneously set\ncapacities and prices in order to maximize their profit and customers\nsubsequently choose the services with lowest combined cost (congestion and\nprice). For this basic model, Johari et al. (2010) derived the first existence\nand uniqueness results of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) assuming mild conditions\non congestion functions. Their existence proof relies on Kakutani's fixed-point\ntheorem and a key assumption for the theorem to work is that demand for service\nis elastic (modeled by a smooth and strictly decreasing inverse demand\nfunction).\n  In this paper, we consider the case of perfectly inelastic demand, i.e. there\nis a fixed volume of customers requesting service. This scenario applies to\nrealistic cases where customers are not willing to drop out of the market, e.g.\nif prices are regulated by reasonable price caps. We investigate existence,\nuniqueness and quality of PNE for models with inelastic demand and price caps.\nWe show that for linear congestion cost functions, there exists a PNE.

Conflict-free\nReplicated Data Types (CRDTs) are important building blocks in this domain\nbecause they are designed to operate correctly under the myriad behaviors\npossible in a weakly-consistent distributed setting. Because of the possibility\nof concurrent updates to the same object at different replicas, and the absence\nof any ordering guarantees on these updates, convergence is an important\ncorrectness criterion for CRDTs. This property asserts that two replicas which\nreceive the same set of updates (in any order) must nonetheless converge to the\nsame state. One way to prove that operations on a CRDT converge is to show that\nthey commute since commutative actions by definition behave the same regardless\nof the order in which they execute. In this paper, we present a framework for\nautomatically verifying convergence of CRDTs under different weak-consistency\npolicies. Surprisingly, depending upon the consistency policy supported by the\nunderlying system, we show that not all operations of a CRDT need to commute to\nachieve convergence. We develop a proof rule parameterized by a consistency\nspecification based on the concepts of commutativity modulo consistency policy\nand non-interference to commutativity. We describe the design and\nimplementation of a verification engine equipped with this rule and show how it\ncan be used to provide the first automated convergence proofs for a number of\nchallenging CRDTs, including sets, lists, and graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 15:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and flexible\nmodels for modeling time-series data. However, the high time complexity of GPs\nlimits their applications in online anomaly detection. Attributed to some\ninternal or external changes, concept drift usually occurs in time-series data,\nwhere the characteristics of data and meanings of abnormal behaviors alter over\ntime. Online anomaly detection methods should have the ability to adapt to\nconcept drift. Motivated by the above facts, this paper proposes the method of\nsparse Gaussian processes with Q-function (SGP-Q). The SGP-Q employs sparse\nGaussian processes (SGPs) whose time complexity is lower than that of GPs, thus\nsignificantly speeding up online anomaly detection. By using Q-function\nproperly, the SGP-Q can adapt to concept drift well. Moreover, the SGP-Q makes\nuse of few abnormal data in the training data by its strategy of updating\ntraining data, resulting in more accurate sparse Gaussian process regression\nmodels and better anomaly detection results.

In this work we report on our investigation of\nthe quantum many-body dynamics of a large ensemble of bosonic magnetic chromium\natoms with spin S = 3 in a three-dimensional lattice as a function of lattice\ndepth. Using extensive theory and experimental comparisons we study the\ndynamics of the population of the different Zeeman levels and the total\nmagnetization of the gas across the superfluid to the Mott insulator\ntransition. We are able to identify two distinct regimes: At low lattice\ndepths, where atoms are in the superfluid regime, we observe that the spin\ndynamics is strongly determined by the competition between particle motion,\nonsite interactions and external magnetic field gradients. Contact spin\ndependent interactions help to stabilize the collective spin length, which sets\nthe total magnetization of the gas. On the contrary, at high lattice depths,\ntransport is largely frozen out. In this regime, while the spin populations are\nmainly driven by long range dipolar interactions, magnetic field gradients also\nplay a major role in the total spin demagnetization. We find that dynamics at\nlow lattice depth is qualitatively reproduced by mean-field calculations based\non the Gutzwiller ansatz; on the contrary, only a beyond mean-field theory can\naccount for the dynamics at large lattice depths.

The performance of the SpMV operation often\ndepends on exploiting regularity patterns in the matrix. Various\nrepresentations have been proposed to minimize the memory bandwidth bottleneck\narising from the irregular memory access pattern involved. Among recent\nrepresentation techniques, tensor decomposition is a popular one used for very\nlarge but sparse matrices. Post sparse-tensor decomposition, the new\nrepresentation involves indirect accesses, making it challenging to optimize\nfor multi-cores and GPUs.\n  Computational neuroscience algorithms often involve sparse datasets while\nstill performing long-running computations on them.

Therefore, reliable and\naccurate closure models for unresolved physics remains an important requirement\nfor many computational physics problems, e.g., turbulence simulation. Recently,\nseveral researchers have adopted generative adversarial networks (GANs), a\nnovel paradigm of training machine learning models, to generate solutions of\nPDEs-governed complex systems without having to numerically solve these PDEs.\nHowever, GANs are known to be difficult in training and likely to converge to\nlocal minima, where the generated samples do not capture the true statistics of\nthe training data. In this work, we present a statistical constrained\ngenerative adversarial network by enforcing constraints of covariance from the\ntraining data, which results in an improved machine-learning-based emulator to\ncapture the statistics of the training data generated by solving fully resolved\nPDEs. We show that such a statistical regularization leads to better\nperformance compared to standard GANs, measured by (1) the constrained model's\nability to more faithfully emulate certain physical properties of the system\nand (2) the significantly reduced (by up to 80%) training time to reach the\nsolution. We exemplify this approach on the Rayleigh-Benard convection, a\nturbulent flow system that is an idealized model of the Earth's atmosphere.\nWith the growth of high-fidelity simulation databases of physical systems, this\nwork suggests great potential for being an alternative to the explicit modeling\nof closures or parameterizations for unresolved physics, which are known to be\na major source of uncertainty in simulating multi-scale physical systems, e.g.,\nturbulence or Earth's climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 18:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

However, application of these methods to medical\nimaging requires further assessment and validation to assist pathologists to\nincrease the efficiency of their workflow in both routine tasks and critical\ncases of diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 07:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

Considering the\ntraining data is often limited in biomedical tasks, a tradeoff has to be made\nbetween model size and its representational power. To address this concern, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel 3D Dense Separated Convolution (3D-DSC) module\nto replace the original 3D convolutional kernels. The 3D-DSC module is\nconstructed by a series of densely connected 1D filters. The decomposition of\n3D kernel into 1D filters reduces the risk of over-fitting by removing the\nredundancy of 3D kernels in a topologically constrained manner, while providing\nthe infrastructure for deepening the network. By further introducing nonlinear\nlayers and dense connections between 1D filters, the network's representational\npower can be significantly improved while maintaining a compact architecture.\nWe demonstrate the superiority of 3D-DSC on volumetric image classification and\nsegmentation, which are two challenging tasks often encountered in biomedical\nimage computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 03:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Three representative SP acquisition methods\nbased on pseudo-disambiguation are evaluated with SP-10K. To demonstrate the\nimportance of our dataset, we investigate the relationship between SP-10K and\nthe commonsense knowledge in ConceptNet5 and show the potential of using SP to\nrepresent the commonsense knowledge. We also use the Winograd Schema Challenge\nto prove that the proposed new SP relations are essential for the hard pronoun\ncoreference resolution problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 08:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

Learning representations for\nthese spoken utterances is a complex research problem due to the presence of\nmultiple heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in multimodal\nlearning have followed the general trend of building more complex models that\nutilize various attention, memory and recurrent components. In this paper, we\npropose two simple but strong baselines to learn embeddings of multimodal\nutterances. The first baseline assumes a conditional factorization of the\nutterance into unimodal factors. Each unimodal factor is modeled using the\nsimple form of a likelihood function obtained via a linear transformation of\nthe embedding. We show that the optimal embedding can be derived in closed form\nby taking a weighted average of the unimodal features. In order to capture\nricher representations, our second baseline extends the first by factorizing\ninto unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal factors, while retaining simplicity and\nefficiency during learning and inference. From a set of experiments across two\ntasks, we show strong performance on both supervised and semi-supervised\nmultimodal prediction, as well as significant (10 times) speedups over neural\nmodels during inference. Overall, we believe that our strong baseline models\noffer new benchmarking options for future research in multimodal learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 13:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

We first define the Homotopic Convex (HC)\ntransformation of a TSP as a convex combination of a well-constructed simple\nTSP and the original TSP. The simple TSP, called the convex-hull TSP, is\nconstructed by transforming a known local or global optimum. We observe that\ncontrolled by the coefficient of the convex combination, with local or global\noptimum, (i) the landscape of the HC transformed TSP is smoothed in terms that\nits number of local optima is reduced compared to the original TSP; (ii) the\nfitness distance correlation of the HC transformed TSP is increased. Further,\nwe observe that the smoothing effect of the HC transformation depends highly on\nthe quality of the used optimum. A high-quality optimum leads to a better\nsmoothing effect than a low-quality optimum. We then propose an iterative\nalgorithmic framework in which the proposed HC transformation is combined\nwithin a heuristic TSP solver. It works as an escaping scheme from local optima\naiming to improve the global search ability of the combined heuristic. Case\nstudies using the 3-Opt and the Lin-Kernighan local search as the heuristic\nsolver show that the resultant algorithms significantly outperform their\ncounterparts and two other smoothing-based TSP heuristic solvers on most of the\ntest instances with up to 20,000 cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 12:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 03:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 10:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

A key feature of the\nnetwork is that it initially generates a distribution of devices that broadly\nsamples the design space, and then shifts and refines this distribution towards\nfavorable design space regions over the course of optimization. Training is\nperformed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of\noutputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for\nbackpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and\nangles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained\ngenerative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best\ndevices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less\ncomputational cost.
