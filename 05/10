The terminology best-scored stands for selecting one density tree\nwith the best estimation performance out of a certain number of purely random\ndensity tree candidates and we then name the selected one the best-scored\nrandom density tree. In this manner, the ensemble of these selected trees that\nis the best-scored random density forest can achieve even better estimation\nresults than simply integrating trees without selection. From the theoretical\nperspective, by decomposing the error term into two, we are able to carry out\nthe following analysis: First of all, we establish the consistency of the\nbest-scored random density trees under $L_1$-norm. Secondly, we provide the\nconvergence rates of them under $L_1$-norm concerning with three different tail\nassumptions, respectively.

Our aim is to shed light on the location and physics of the\nabsorbing clouds.

We used the capabilities of CRIRES\nspectrograph located at ESO Very Large Telescope in Chile to obtain absorption\nspectra of individual lines at a high spectral resolution of R=65000, that is,\n5 km/s.

The data provide direct evidence for a complex structure of the\ninterstellar medium along the line of sight and in the close environment of the\ncentral sources.

While\nBART is now routinely performed for prediction tasks, its theoretical\nproperties began to be understood only very recently. In this work, we continue\nthe theoretical investigation of BART initiated by Rockova and van der Pas\n(2017). In particular, we study the Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) phenomenon (i.e.\nasymptotic normality) for smooth linear functionals of the regression surface\nwithin the framework of non-parametric regression with fixed covariates. As\nwith other adaptive priors, the BvM phenomenon may fail when the regularities\nof the functional and the truth are not compatible. To overcome the curse of\nadaptivity under hierarchical priors, we induce a self-similarity assumption to\nensure convergence towards a single Gaussian distribution as opposed to a\nGaussian mixture. Similar qualitative restrictions on the functional parameter\nare known to be necessary for adaptive inference. Many machine learning methods\nlack coherent probabilistic mechanisms for gauging uncertainty. BART readily\nprovides such quantification via posterior credible sets. The BvM theorem\nimplies that the credible sets are also confidence regions with the same\nasymptotic coverage. This paper presents the first asymptotic normality result\nfor BART priors, providing another piece of evidence that BART is a valid tool\nfrom a frequentist point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 16:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

We investigate the possible\nconnection between the SNR, the PWN G29.4+0.1, and HESS J1844-030 to shed light\non the astrophysical origin of the TeV emission. METHODS: We performed an\nimaging and spectral study of the X-ray emission from the PWN G29.4+0.1 using\narchival observations obtained with the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes.\nPublic radio continuum and HI data were used to derive distance constraints for\nthe SNR that is linked to G29.37+0.1 and to investigate the interstellar medium\nwhere it is expanding. We applied a simple model of the evolution of a PWN\ninside an SNR to analyze the association between G29.4+0.1 and the radio\nemission from G29.37+0.1. We compared the spectral properties of the system\nwith the population of TeV PWNe to investigate if HESS J1844-030 is the very\nhigh energy counterpart of the X-ray PWN G29.4+0.1. RESULTS: We conclude that\nG29.4+0.1 is a PWN and that a point source embedded on it is the powering\npulsar. The HI data revealed that the SNR linked to G29.37+0.1 is a Galactic\nsource at 6.5 kpc and expanding in a nonuniform medium. From the analysis of\nthe pulsar motion and the pressure balance at the boundary of X-ray emission,\nwe conclude that G29.4+0.1 could be a PWN that is located inside its host\nremnant, forming a new composite SNR. Based on the magnetic field of the PWN\nobtained from the X-ray luminosity, we found that the population of electrons\nproducing synchrotron radiation in the keV band can also produce IC photons in\nthe TeV band. This suggests that HESS J1844-030 could be the very high energy\ncounterpart of G29.4+0.1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 16:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

In this theoretical study, we analyse the\nmechanism that triggers the propagation of kink and sausage modes in the solar\ncorona, following the collision of counter-propagating flows and how the\nproperties of the flows affect the properties of the generated waves. In order\nto study in detail such a mechanism we run a series of ideal 2D and 3D MHD\nsimulations where we vary the properties of the counter-propagating flows and\nby means of a simple technique to estimate the amplitudes of the kink and\nsausage modes, we investigate their role on the generation and propagation of\nthe MHD waves.

Moreover, the initial\nwavelength of the MHD waves is associated with the magnetic configuration\nresulting from the collision of the flows.

Representing users\nand items as binary vectors for Collaborative Filtering (CF) can achieve fast\nuser-item affinity computation in the Hamming space, in recent years, we have\nwitnessed an emerging research effort in exploiting binary hashing techniques\nfor CF methods. However, CF with binary codes naturally suffers from low\naccuracy due to limited representation capability in each bit, which impedes it\nfrom modeling complex structure of the data.\n  In this work, we attempt to improve the efficiency without hurting the model\nperformance by utilizing both the accuracy of real-valued vectors and the\nefficiency of binary codes to represent users/items. In particular, we propose\nthe Compositional Coding for Collaborative Filtering (CCCF) framework, which\nnot only gains better recommendation efficiency than the state-of-the-art\nbinarized CF approaches but also achieves even higher accuracy than the\nreal-valued CF method. Specifically, CCCF innovatively represents each\nuser/item with a set of binary vectors, which are associated with a sparse\nreal-value weight vector. Each value of the weight vector encodes the\nimportance of the corresponding binary vector to the user/item. The continuous\nweight vectors greatly enhances the representation capability of binary codes,\nand its sparsity guarantees the processing speed. Furthermore, an integer\nweight approximation scheme is proposed to further accelerate the speed. Based\non the CCCF framework, we design an efficient discrete optimization algorithm\nto learn its parameters.

If this channel-to-channel mapping is possible, we\ncan expect dramatic gains for massive MIMO systems. For example, in FDD massive\nMIMO, the uplink channels can be mapped to the downlink channels or the\ndownlink channels at one subset of antennas can be mapped to the downlink\nchannels at all the other antennas. This can significantly reduce (or even\neliminate) the downlink training/feedback overhead. In the context of\ncell-free/distributed massive MIMO systems, this channel mapping can be\nleveraged to reduce the fronthaul signaling overhead as only the channels at a\nsubset of the distributed terminals need to be fed to the central unit which\ncan map them to the channels at all the other terminals. This mapping can also\nfind interesting applications in mmWave beam prediction, MIMO radar, and\nmassive MIMO based positioning.\n  In this paper, we introduce the new concept of channel mapping in space and\nfrequency, where the channels at one set of antennas and one frequency band are\nmapped to the channels at another set of antennas and frequency band.

To address the complication of event topologies and the\nmess of combinatorial backgrounds, a tool of Boosted-Decision-Tree was applied\nin the analyses.

However, the theoretical Love number due to equilibrium tides is at most\n$k_\\mathrm{2,eq}^\\mathrm{max}\\approx 0.48$ in the absence of an ice shell on\ntop of the ocean. In reality, there is an outer ice shell of thickness $\n100\\,\\mathrm{km}$, reducing the equilibrium-tide Love number to\n$k_\\mathrm{2,eq}\\approx 0.42$. Therefore, other types of tidal response, like\ndynamic tides, may be also present in Titan. We propose that the ocean is\nstably stratified. As a result, there exist standing ocean waves (gravity\nmodes) with eigen-frequencies close to the tidal frequency. Such a gravity mode\n(g-mode) is resonantly excited. It bends the outer ice shell radially and thus\nenhances the dynamic Love number by $k_\\mathrm{2,g}$. In order for\n$k_\\mathrm{2,g}$ to account for the discrepancy between $k_\\mathrm{2,eq}$ and\n$k_\\mathrm{2,obs}$, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the ocean is required to be\n$3.3\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{rad\\, s^{-1}}$. It is compatible with the\nvolatile-rich model for Titan that was proposed to explain the methane-rich\natmosphere. The three components of the tidal potential with azimuthal degrees,\n$m=-2,0,2$, correspond to the three components of the quadrupole Love number,\n$k_\\mathrm{2,-2}$, $k_\\mathrm{2,0}$ and $k_\\mathrm{2,2}$. They can excite\nretrograde, axisymmetric and prograde g-modes equally in the absence of\nrotation. However, Coriolis force induced by Titan's rotation breaks the\nsymmetry among these modes. Most likely, only one of the Love-number components\nis significantly enhanced by a g-mode, while the other two are still attributed\nto equilibrium tides. This prediction is testable by observation. If confirmed,\nthe smaller components of the Love number can be used to constrain the\nthickness of the outer ice shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 18:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Modern\ndatasets can have millions of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e\nthey are extremely high dimensional (one dimension for each individual\ntime-series). There is a need for exploiting global patterns and coupling them\nwith local calibration for better prediction. However, most recent deep\nlearning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e, even though\nthey are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future forecast\nfor a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension.\nIn this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep\nforecasting model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular,\nDeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix factorization model\nregularized by a temporal convolution network, along with another temporal\nnetwork that can capture local properties of each time-series and associated\ncovariates. Our model can be trained effectively on high-dimensional but\ndiverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different\nscales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for\nexample, we see more than 25% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a\npublic dataset that contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 18:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 02:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

The sequence included rupture of multiple\nfault segments, spatially separated. We use surface-wave based relative\ncentroid locations to examine whether, at the small scale, the distribution of\nthe aftershocks was influenced by location errors. Surface-wave based relative\nlocation has delineated precise oceanic transform fault earthquake locations in\nmultiple regions. However, the relocated aftershocks off the coast of Sumatra\nseldom align along simple linear trends that are compatible with the\ncorresponding fault strikes as estimated for the GCMT catalog. The relocation\nof roughly 60 moderate-earthquake epicentroids suggests that the faulting\ninvolved in the 2012 earthquake aftershock sequence included strain release\nalong many short fault segments. Statistical analysis and temporal variations\nof aftershocks show a typical decay of the aftershocks but a relatively low\nnumber of aftershocks, as is common for intraplate oceanic earthquakes. Coulomb\nstress calculations indicate that most of the moderate-magnitude aftershocks\nare compatible with stress changes predicted by the large-event slip models.\nThe patterns in the aftershocks suggest that the formation of the boundary and\neventual localization of deformation between the Indian and Australian plate is\na complicated process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 19:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

If the particle has a hole as\nthe right-neighbor and an occupied site as the left-neighbor, it moves right\nwith probability $0<p<1$. (We refer to the latter rule as a \"holdback\"\nproperty.)

We are therefore\nmotivated to investigate isotopic water exchange between the atmosphere and the\nregolith and determine its effect on the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of\nthe atmosphere. We model transport of water in the regolith and\nregolith-atmosphere exchange by solving a transport equation including regolith\nadsorption, condensation, and diffusion. The model calculates equilibrium\nfractionation between HDO and H2O in each of these processes. The fractionation\nin adsorption is caused by the difference in the latent heat of adsorption, and\nthat of condensation is caused by the difference in the vapor pressure.\nTogether with a simple, bulk-aerodynamic boundary layer model, we simulate the\ndiurnal variation of the D/H near the planetary surface. We find that the D/H\ncan vary by 300 - 1400 per mil diurnally in the equatorial and mid-latitude\nlocations, and the magnitude is greater at a colder location or season. The\nvariability is mainly driven by adsorption and desorption of regolith\nparticles, and its diurnal trend features a drop in the early morning, a rise\nto the peak value during the daytime, and a second drop in the late afternoon\nand evening, tracing the water vapor flow into and out from the regolith.

Charlotte data is stored in blocks that reference each other\nby hash. Together, all Charlotte blocks form a directed acyclic graph, the\nblockweb; all observers and applications use subgraphs of the blockweb for\ntheir own data structures. Unlike prior systems, Charlotte data structures are\ncomposable: applications and data structures can operate fully independently\nwhen possible, and share blocks when desired. To support this composability, we\ndefine a language-independent format for Charlotte blocks and a network API for\nCharlotte servers.\n  An authenticated distributed data structure guarantees that data is immutable\nand self-authenticating: data referenced will be unchanged when it is\nretrieved. Charlotte extends these guarantees by allowing applications to plug\nin their own mechanisms for ensuring availability and integrity of data\nstructures. Unlike most traditional distributed systems, including distributed\ndatabases, blockchains, and distributed hash tables, Charlotte supports\nheterogeneous trust: different observers may have their own beliefs about who\nmight fail, and how. Despite heterogeneity of trust, Charlotte presents each\nobserver with a consistent, available view of data.\n  We demonstrate the flexibility of Charlotte by implementing a variety of\nintegrity mechanisms, including consensus and proof of work. We study the power\nof disentangling availability and integrity mechanisms by building a variety of\napplications. The results from these examples suggest that developers can use\nCharlotte to build flexible, fast, composable applications with strong\nguarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 23:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Highly necessary intelligent traffic control systems, which\nare able to reduce congestion, rely on measurements of traffic situations in\nurban road networks and freeways. Unfortunately, the instrumentation for\naccurate traffic measurement is expensive and not widely implemented. This\nthesis addresses this problem, where relatively inexpensive and easy to install\nloop-detectors are used by a geometric deep learning algorithm, which uses\nloop-detector data in a spatial context of a road network, to estimate queue\nlength in front of signalized intersections, which can be then used for\nfollowing traffic control tasks. Therefore, in the first part of this work a\nconventional estimation method for queue length (which does not use machine\nlearning techniques) based on second-by-second loop-detector data is\nimplemented, which uses detected shockwaves in queues to estimate the length\nand point of time for the maximum queue. The method is later used as reference\nbut also as additional input information for the geometric deep learning\napproach. In the second part the geometric deep learning algorithm is\ndeveloped, which uses spatial correlations in the road network but also\ntemporal correlations in detector data time sequences by new attention\nmechanisms, to overcome the limitations of conventional methods like excess\ntraffic demand, lane changing and stop-and-go traffic. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to abstract the topology of the road network in a graph. Both\napproaches are compared regarding their performance, reliability as well as\nlimitations and validated by usage of the traffic simulation software SUMO\n(Simulation of Urban MObility). Finally, the results are discussed in the\nconclusions and further investigations are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 23:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

That said,\npractical realization of this theorem still suffers from a severe bottleneck\ndue to the fundamental assumption that the samples can span an arbitrary range\nof amplitudes. In practice, the theorem is realized using so-called\nanalog-to-digital converters (ADCs) which clip or saturate whenever the signal\namplitude exceeds the maximum recordable ADC voltage thus leading to a\nsignificant information loss. In this paper, we develop an alternative paradigm\nfor sensing and recovery, called the Unlimited Sampling Framework. It is based\non the observation that when a signal is mapped to an appropriate bounded\ninterval via a modulo operation before entering the ADC, the saturation problem\nno longer exists, but one rather encounters a different type of information\nloss due to the modulo operation. Such an alternative setup can be implemented,\nfor example, via so-called folding or self-reset ADCs, as they have been\nproposed in various contexts in the circuit design literature. The key task\nthat we need to accomplish in order to cope with this new type of information\nloss is to recover a bandlimited signal from its modulo samples. In this paper\nwe derive conditions when perfect recovery is possible and complement them with\na stable recovery algorithm. The sampling density required to guarantee\nrecovery is independent of the maximum recordable ADC voltage and depends on\nthe signal bandwidth only. Our recovery guarantees extend to measurements\naffected by bounded noise, which includes the case of round-off quantization.\nNumerical experiments validate our approach.

Existing\nkeyword-based or content-based video retrieval methods usually determine what\noccurs in a video but not when and where. In this paper, we make an answer to\nthe question of when and where by formulating a new task, namely\nspatio-temporal video re-localization. Specifically, given a query video and a\nreference video, spatio-temporal video re-localization aims to localize\ntubelets in the reference video such that the tubelets semantically correspond\nto the query. To accurately localize the desired tubelets in the reference\nvideo, we propose a novel warp LSTM network, which propagates the\nspatio-temporal information for a long period and thereby captures the\ncorresponding long-term dependencies.

However, the nematic\nsusceptibility is suppressed at low temperatures for $x$ larger than $0.04$,\nwhich may be related to the short-range antiferromagnetic order that survives\nup to very high doping level. Doping Mn, Cr and Cu into the optimally-doped\nsuperconducting BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.69}$P$_{0.31}$)$_2$ also strongly reduces\n$|A_n|$. Compared with those systems that clearly exhibit superconductivity,\nsuch as Ni, K or P doped samples, our results suggest a strong connection\nbetween the nematic and spin degrees of freedom. Moreover, the reason of the\nsuppression of superconductivity by dopants such as Cr, Mn, V and Cu may be\ncorrelated with the suppression of nematic fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 05:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Under\ncontroller failures, we need to remap the control of offline switches from\nfailed controllers to other active controllers. Existing solutions could either\noverload active controllers to interrupt their normal operations or degrade\nnetwork performance because of increasing the controller-switch communication\noverhead. In this paper, we propose RetroFlow to achieve low communication\noverhead without interrupting the normal processing of active controllers\nduring controller failures. By intelligently configuring a set of selected\noffline switches working under the legacy routing mode, RetroFlow relieves the\nactive controllers from controlling the selected offline switches while\nmaintaining the flow programmability (e.g., the ability to change paths of\nflows) of SDN. RetroFlow also smartly transfers the control of offline switches\nwith the SDN routing mode to active controllers to minimize the communication\noverhead from these offline switches to the active controllers. Simulation\nresults show that compared with the baseline algorithm, RetroFlow can reduce\nthe communication overhead up to 52.6% during a moderate controller failure by\nrecovering 100% flows from offline switches and can reduce the communication\noverhead up to 61.2% during a serious controller failure by setting to recover\n90% of flows from offline switches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 05:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

We ask whether time preferences can be\ninferred when \\textsl{only} task completion is observed. To answer this\nquestion, we analyze the following model: each period a decision maker faces\nthe choice whether to complete the task today or to postpone it to later. Cost\nand benefits of task completion cannot be directly observed by the analyst, but\nthe analyst knows that net benefits are drawn independently between periods\nfrom a time-invariant distribution and that the agent has time-separable\nutility. Furthermore, we suppose the analyst can observe the agent's exact\nstopping probability. We establish that for any agent with quasi-hyperbolic\n$\\beta,\\delta$-preferences and given level of partial naivete $\\hat{\\beta}$,\nthe probability of completing the task conditional on not having done it\nearlier increases towards the deadline.

When fully hybridised the ratio between the coupling rate and uncoupled\nmode frequencies is determined to be $g/\\omega=0.46$. Next a thin YIG cylinder\nis placed inside a loop gap cavity. The bright mode of this cavity couples to\nthe YIG sample and is similarly measured to be in the ultra strong coupling\nregime with ratio of coupling rate to uncoupled mode frequencies as\n$g/\\omega=0.34$. A larger spin density medium such as lithium ferrite (LiFe) is\nexpected to improve couplings by a factor of 1.46 in both systems as coupling\nstrength is shown to be proportional to the square root of spin density and\nmagnetic moment. Such strongly coupled systems are potentially useful for\ncavity QED, hybrid quantum systems and precision dark matter detection\nexperiments.

Demonstrating their potential in supporting diverse\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) applications, we focus on long range (LoRa) networks\nwhere the LoRa users are using the harvested energy to transmit data to a\ngateway via different spreading codes. Precisely, we study the throughput\nfairness optimization problem for LoRa users by jointly optimizing the\nspreading factor (SF) assignment, energy harvesting (EH) time duration, and the\ntransmit power of LoRa users. First, through examination of the various\npermutations of collisions among users, we derive a general expression of the\npacket collision time between LoRa users, which depends on the SFs and EH\nduration requirements. Then, after reviewing prior SF allocation work, we\ndevelop two types of algorithms that either assure fair SF assignment indeed\npurposefully 'unfair' allocation schemes for the LoRa users.

In many real-time\napplications, the training data is obtained one by one or batch by batch. It\nresults in that the static model limits its performance on sequential images\nwith extensive variations. Therefore, the most critical and challenging aspect\nin this field is dynamically updating the tracker's models to enhance\npredictive and generalization capabilities continuously. In order to address\nthis question, we develop a fast and accurate online learning algorithm for\nface alignment.

In order to\ndetermine whether a purely vascular dysfunction or a neuronal alteration of\nblood vessels diameter control could be responsible for the impaired\nneurovascular coupling observed in AD, blood vessels reactivity in response to\ndifferent pharmacological stimulations was examined in double transgenic\nAPPxPS1 mice model of AD. Blood vessels movements were monitored using infrared\nvideomicroscopy ex vivo, in cortical slices of 8 month-old APPxPS1 and wild\ntype (WT) mice. We quantified vasomotor responses induced either by direct\nblood vessel stimulation with a thromboxane A 2 analogue, the U46619\n(9,11-dideoxy-11a,9a-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2) or via the stimulation of\ninterneurons with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) agonist DMPP\n(1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide). Using both types of stimulation, no\nsignificant differences were detected for the amplitude of blood vessel\ndiameter changes between the transgenic APPxPS1 mice model of AD and WT mice,\nalthough the kinetics of recovery were slower in APPxPS1 mice.

The training tasks\nare generated by subgraph sampling, and the training objective is obtained by\naccumulating the level-wise classification loss on the subgraph.

Following this line of\nresearch, we study the distribution of AoI for the GI/GI/1/1 and GI/GI/1/2*\nsystems, under non-preemptive scheduling. For any single-source-single-server\nqueueing system, we derive, using sample path analysis, a fundamental result\nthat characterizes the AoI violation probability, and use it to obtain\nclosed-form expressions for D/GI/1/1, M/GI/1/1 as well as systems that use\nzero-wait policy. Further, when exact results are not tractable, we present a\nsimple methodology for obtaining upper bounds for the violation probability for\nboth GI/GI/1/1 and GI/GI/1/2* systems. An interesting feature of the proposed\nupper bounds is that, if the departure rate is given, they overestimate the\nviolation probability by at most a value that decreases with the arrival rate.\nThus, given the departure rate and for a fixed average service, the bounds are\ntighter at higher utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 11:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Though automatic FER has made substantial progresses in the\npast few decades, occlusion-robust and pose-invariant issues of FER have\nreceived relatively less attention, especially in real-world scenarios. This\npaper addresses the real-world pose and occlusion robust FER problem with\nthree-fold contributions. First, to stimulate the research of FER under\nreal-world occlusions and variant poses, we build several in-the-wild facial\nexpression datasets with manual annotations for the community. Second, we\npropose a novel Region Attention Network (RAN), to adaptively capture the\nimportance of facial regions for occlusion and pose variant FER. The RAN\naggregates and embeds varied number of region features produced by a backbone\nconvolutional neural network into a compact fixed-length representation. Last,\ninspired by the fact that facial expressions are mainly defined by facial\naction units, we propose a region biased loss to encourage high attention\nweights for the most important regions. We validate our RAN and region biased\nloss on both our built test datasets and four popular datasets: FERPlus,\nAffectNet, RAF-DB, and SFEW. Extensive experiments show that our RAN and region\nbiased loss largely improve the performance of FER with occlusion and variant\npose. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art results on FERPlus, AffectNet,\nRAF-DB, and SFEW.

In this paper, we propose a method for\nextracting more detailed physical knowledge from a set of RGB-D images taken\nfrom the same scene but from different views using qualitative reasoning and\nintuitive physical models. Rather than providing a simple contact relation\ngraph and approximating stability over convex shapes, our method is able to\nprovide a detailed supporting relation analysis based on a volumetric\nrepresentation. Specifically, true supporting relations between objects (e.g.,\nif an object supports another object by touching it on the side or if the\nobject above contributes to the stability of the object below) are identified.\nWe apply our method to real-world structures captured in warehouse scenarios\nand show our method works as desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 11:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

An in-depth investigation of the actual structure and composition of\nthe nanowires reveals a spontaneously formed Al gradient both along and across\nthe nanowire, resulting in a complex core/shell structure with an Al deficient\ncore and an Al rich shell with continuously varying Al content along the entire\nlength of the (Al,Ga)N segment.

Starting in 2007, the surface brightnesses\nof the eastern and western outflow cavities were roughly symmetric. Then, in\n2009, the surface brightnesses of the cavities were found to be asymmetric,\nwith a substantial increase in surface brightness and a larger increase in the\neastern outflow cavity. More regular monitoring was conducted from 2011 to\n2014, revealing a rotating pattern of surface brightness variability in\naddition to a slow change of the eastern and western outflow cavities toward\nsymmetry, but still not as symmetric as observed in 2007. We find that an inner\ndisk warp is a feasible mechanism to produce the rotating pattern of surface\nbrightness variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 12:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

They are\nlong, slender, and motile protrusions from the cell body. They undergo active\nregular oscillatory beating patterns that can propel cells, such as the algae\nChlamydomonas, through fluids. When many cilia beat in synchrony they can also\npropel fluid along the surfaces of cells, as is the case of nodal cilia.\n  The main structural elements inside the cilium are microtubules. There are\nalso molecular motors of the dynein family that actively power the motion of\nthe cilium. These motors transform chemical energy in the form of ATP into\nmechanical forces that produce sliding displacement between the microtubules.\nThis sliding is converted to bending by constraints at the base and/or along\nthe length of the cilium. Forces and displacements within the cilium can\nregulate dyneins and provide a feedback mechanism: the dyneins generate forces,\ndeforming the cilium; the deformations, in turn, regulate the dyneins. This\nfeedback is believed to be the origin of the coordination of dyneins in space\nand time which underlies the regularity of the beat pattern.\n  Goals and approach. While the mechanism by which dyneins bend the cilium is\nunderstood, the feedback mechanism is much less clear. The two key questions\nare: which forces and displacements are the most relevant in regulating the\nbeat? and how exactly does this regulation occur?\n  In this thesis we develop a framework to describe the spatio-temporal\npatterns of a cilium with different mechanisms of motor regulation.\nCharacterizing and comparing the predicted shapes and beat patterns of these\ndifferent mechanisms to those observed in experiments provides us with further\nunderstanding on how dyneins are regulated. This comparison is done both, with\na linear model that can be analytically solved, as with a non-linear model that\nwe solve numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 12:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Simple stochastic\ngames exhibiting this paradox have been introduced around the turn of the\nmillennium. The common setting of these Parrondo games is that two rules, $A$\nand $B$, are played at discrete time steps, following either a periodic pattern\nor an aperiodic one, be it deterministic or random. These games can be mapped\nonto 1D random walks. In capital-dependent games, the probabilities of moving\nright or left depend on the walker's position modulo some integer $K$. In\nhistory-dependent games, each step is correlated with the $Q$ previous ones. In\nboth cases the gain identifies with the velocity of the walker's ballistic\nmotion, which depends non-linearly on model parameters, allowing for the\npossibility of Parrondo's paradox. Calculating the gain involves products of\nnon-commuting Markov matrices, which are somehow analogous to the transfer\nmatrices used in the physics of 1D disordered systems. Elaborating upon this\nanalogy, we study a paradigmatic Parrondo game of each class in the neutral\nsituation where each rule, when played alone, is fair.

The crossover between both spin\nstructures is correctly predicted by density functional theory and can be\nqualitatively understood in a low-energy spin model.

As a consequence, we give a\ntopological explanation for certain asymptotic phenomenon appearing in the\ncombinatorics and number theory literature. Furthermore, we show how to combine\ntopological methods with symbolic algebraic computation to determine explicitly\nthe dominant asymptotics for such multivariate generating functions, giving a\nsignificant new tool to attack the so-called connection problem for asymptotics\nof P-recursive sequences. This in turn enables the rigorous determination of\ninteger coefficients in the Morse-Smale complex, which are difficult to\ndetermine using direct geometric methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 13:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 22:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

To\nease this process, we consider diverse clusterings embedded in different\nsubspaces, and analyze the embedding subspaces to shed light into the structure\nof each clustering. To this end, we provide a two-stage approach called MISC\n(Multiple Independent Subspace Clusterings). In the first stage, MISC uses\nindependent subspace analysis to seek multiple and statistical independent\n(i.e. non-redundant) subspaces, and determines the number of subspaces via the\nminimum description length principle. In the second stage, to account for the\nintrinsic geometric structure of samples embedded in each subspace, MISC\nperforms graph regularized semi-nonnegative matrix factorization to explore\nclusters. It additionally integrates the kernel trick into matrix factorization\nto handle non-linearly separable clusters. Experimental results on synthetic\ndatasets show that MISC can find different interesting clusterings from the\nsought independent subspaces, and it also outperforms other related and\ncompetitive approaches on real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 14:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

Recently, the cluster assumption has been applied to unsupervised\ndomain adaptation and achieved strong performance. One critical factor in\nsuccessful training of the cluster assumption is to impose the\nlocally-Lipschitz constraint to the model. Existing methods only impose the\nlocally-Lipschitz constraint around the training points while miss the other\nareas, such as the points in-between training data. In this paper, we address\nthis issue by encouraging the model to behave linearly in-between training\npoints. We propose a new regularization method called Virtual Mixup Training\n(VMT), which is able to incorporate the locally-Lipschitz constraint to the\nareas in-between training data. Unlike the traditional mixup model, our method\nconstructs the combination samples without using the label information,\nallowing it to apply to unsupervised domain adaptation.

The standard technique used to reconstruct the CMB lensing\nsignal employs the quadratic estimator (QE) method, which has recently been\nshown to be suboptimal for lensing measurements on very small scales in\ntemperature and polarization data. We implement a simple, more optimal method\nfor the small-scale regime, which involves taking the direct inverse of the\nbackground gradient. We derive new techniques to make continuous maps of\nlensing using this \"Gradient-Inversion\" (GI) method and validate our method\nwith simulated data, finding good agreement with predictions. For idealized\nsimulations of lensing cross- and autospectra that neglect foregrounds, we\ndemonstrate that our method performs significantly better than previous\nquadratic estimator methods in temperature; at $L=5000-9000$, it reduces errors\non the lensing auto-power spectrum by a factor of $\\sim 4$ for both idealized\nCMB-S4 and Simons Observatory-like experiments and by a factor of $\\sim 2.6$\nfor cross-correlations of CMB-S4-like lensing reconstruction and the true\nlensing field.

In this study, we demonstrate supervised machine learning based\nmulti-task OCTA classification. We sought 1) to differentiate normal from\ndiseased ocular conditions, 2) to differentiate different ocular disease\nconditions from each other, and 3) to stage the severity of each ocular\ncondition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT),\nblood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel\ndensity (BVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (FAZ-A), and FAZ contour\nirregularity (FAZ-CI) were fully automatically extracted from the OCTA images.\nA stepwise backward elimination approach was employed to identify sensitive\nOCTA features and optimal-feature-combinations for the multi-task\nclassification. For proof-of-concept demonstration, diabetic retinopathy (DR)\nand sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) were used to validate the supervised machine\nleaning classifier. The presented AI classification methodology is applicable\nand can be readily extended to other ocular diseases, holding promise to enable\na mass-screening platform for clinical deployment and telemedicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 15:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

It has the\npotential to model any sequential time-series data, where the current hidden\nstate has to be considered in the context of the past hidden states. This\nproperty makes LSTM an ideal choice to learn the complex dynamics present in\nlong sequences. Unfortunately, the conventional LSTMs do not consider the\nimpact of spatio-temporal dynamics corresponding to the given salient motion\npatterns, when they gate the information that ought to be memorized through\ntime. To address this problem, we propose a differential gating scheme for the\nLSTM neural network, which emphasizes on the change in information gain caused\nby the salient motions between the successive video frames. This change in\ninformation gain is quantified by Derivative of States (DoS), and thus the\nproposed LSTM model is termed as differential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN).\nIn addition, the original work used the hidden state at the last time-step to\nmodel the entire video sequence. Based on the energy profiling of DoS, we\nfurther propose to employ the State Energy Profile (SEP) to search for salient\ndRNN states and construct more informative representations. The effectiveness\nof the proposed model was demonstrated by automatically recognizing human\nactions from the real-world 2D and 3D single-person action datasets. We point\nout that LSTM is a special form of dRNN. As a result, we have introduced a new\nfamily of LSTMs. Our study is one of the first works towards demonstrating the\npotential of learning complex time-series representations via high-order\nderivatives of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 18:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

SNMF focuses on the word co-occurrence patterns to reveal topics by two\nsteps: anchor word selection and topic recovery. The quality of the anchor\nwords strongly influences the quality of the extracted topics. Existing anchor\nword selection algorithm is to greedily find an approximate convex hull in a\nhigh-dimensional word co-occurrence space. In this work, we propose a new\nmethod for the anchor word selection by associating the word co-occurrence\nprobability with the words similarity and assuming that the most different\nwords on semantic are potential candidates for the anchor words. Therefore, if\nthe similarity of a word-pair is very low, then the two words are very likely\nto be the anchor words. According to the statistical information of text\ncorpora, we can get the similarity of all word-pairs. We build the word\nsimilarity graph where the nodes correspond to words and weights on edges stand\nfor the word-pair similarity. Following this way, we design a greedy method to\nfind a minimum edge-weight anchor clique of a given size in the graph for the\nanchor word selection. Extensive experiments on real-world corpus demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed anchor word selection method that outperforms\nthe common convex hull-based methods on the revealed topic quality.

Many such matrix\nalgorithms are inductive, and exhibit ample amounts of fine-grain ordered\nparallelism -- when multiple computations flow with fine-grain\nproducer/consumer dependences, and where the iteration domain is not easily\ntileable. Synchronization overheads make multi-core parallelism ineffective and\nthe non-tileable iterations make the vector-VLIW approach less effective,\nespecially for the typically modest-sized matrices. Because CPUs and DSPs lose\norder-of-magnitude performance/hardware utilization, costly and inflexible\nASICs are often employed in signal processing pipelines. A programmable\naccelerator with similar performance/power/area would be highly desirable. We\nfind that fine-grain ordered parallelism can be exploited by supporting: 1.\nfine-grain stream-based communication/synchronization; 2. inductive data-reuse\nand memory access patterns; 3. implicit vector-masking for partial vectors; 4.\nhardware specialization of dataflow criticality.

Our approach was to collect a novel, naturalistic,\nand multimodal dataset of eye+head movements when subjects performed everyday\ntasks while wearing a mobile eye tracker equipped with an inertial measurement\nunit and a 3D stereo camera. This Gaze-in-the-Wild dataset (GW) includes\neye+head rotational velocities (deg/s), infrared eye images and scene imagery\n(RGB+D). A portion was labelled by coders into gaze motion events with a mutual\nagreement of 0.72 sample based Cohen's $\\kappa$. This labelled data was used to\ntrain and evaluate two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and a\nRecurrent Neural Network model, for gaze event classification. Assessment\ninvolved the application of established and novel event based performance\nmetrics. Classifiers achieve $\\sim$90$\\%$ human performance in detecting\nfixations and saccades but fall short (60$\\%$) on detecting pursuit movements.\nMoreover, pursuit classification is far worse in the absence of head movement\ninformation. A subsequent analysis of feature significance in our\nbest-performing model revealed a reliance upon absolute eye and head velocity,\nindicating that classification does not require spatial alignment of the head\nand eye tracking coordinate systems. The GW dataset, trained classifiers and\nevaluation metrics will be made publicly available with the intention of\nfacilitating growth in the emerging area of head-free gaze event\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 16:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Previous works on synthesis of images from\ntext typically rely on pre-trained text models to extract text features,\nfollowed by a generative neural networks (GANs) aimed to generate realistic\nimages conditioned on the text features. These works mainly focus on generating\nspatially compact and well-defined categories of objects, such as birds or\nflowers. In contrast, meal images are significantly more complex, consisting of\nmultiple ingredients whose appearance and spatial qualities are further\nmodified by cooking methods. We propose a method that first builds an\nattention-based ingredients-image association model, which is then used to\ncondition a generative neural network tasked with synthesizing meal images.\nFurthermore, a cycle-consistent constraint is added to further improve image\nquality and control appearance. Extensive experiments show our model is able to\ngenerate meal image corresponding to the ingredients, which could be used to\naugment existing dataset for solving other computational food analysis\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 20:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

The\nobjective of each mobile user is then to find the optimal transmission power\nthat maximizes its energy efficiency. The expression of the energy efficiency\nis analytically derived for the realistic case of a finite size network.\nSimulation results show that the proposed approach yields gains of up to 24%,\nin terms of energy efficiency, compared to a baseline in which the nodes\ntransmit according to the path loss compensating power control policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 01:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

However, this task\nrequires acoustic transformations from sound waveforms with varying amplitudes\nto frequency domain maps that can be seen as feature extraction techniques.\nDepending on the conversion method, these may obscure the contribution of the\nneuromorphic hardware to the overall speech recognition performance. Here, we\nquantify and separate the contributions of the acoustic transformations and the\nneuromorphic hardware to the speech recognition success rate. We show that the\nnon-linearity in the acoustic transformation plays a critical role in feature\nextraction. We compute the gain in word success rate provided by a reservoir\ncomputing device compared to the acoustic transformation only, and show that it\nis an appropriate benchmark for comparing different hardware.

As\nfew research papers have proposed a framework to quantify the performance of an\ninfluencer by using quantitative influencer data (number of followers,\nengagement,...), qualitative information (age, country, city, etc...), natural\ntext (profile and post descriptions) and visual information (images and\nvideos), we decided to explore these variables and quantitatively evaluate\ntheir dependencies. By analyzing 713,824 influencers on 5 social media\nplatforms over a period of one year, we identified relationships between value\nproposition data (engagement, reach, audience), demographics, natural text\npatterns and visual information. The main goal of this paper is to provide IM\nprofessionals with a modern methodology to better understand the value of their\ninfluencers and to feed machine learning algorithms for clustering, scoring or\nrecommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 09:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}
