Despite\nremarkable advantages offered by these technologies, signaling overhead remains\na major issue in accessing the network. In particular, the load of signaling is\nmainly attributed to location management. This paper proposes an efficient\napproach for minimizing the total signaling overhead of location management in\nLTE networks using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO).\nTracking area update (TAU) and paging are considered to be the main elements of\nthe signaling overhead of optimal location management in LTE. In addition, the\ntotal inter-list handover contributes significantly to the total signaling\noverhead. However, the total signaling cost of TAU and paging is adversely\nrelated to the total inter-list handover. Two cost functions should be\nminimized, the first is the total signaling cost of TAU and paging and the\nsecond is the total signaling overhead. The trade-off between these two\nobjectives can be circumvented by MOPSO, which alleviates the total signaling\noverhead. A set of non-dominated solutions on the Pareto-optimal front is\ndefined and the best compromise solution. The proposed algorithm results\nfeasible compromise solution, minimizing the signaling overhead and the\nconsumption of the power battery of a user. The efficacy and the robustness of\nthe proposed algorithm have been proven using large scale environment problem\nillustrative example. The location management in LTE networks using MOPSO best\ncompromise solution has been compared to a mixed integer non-linear programming\n(MINLP) algorithm.

Here, we examine the role of the\nsubstrate material and intrinsic defects in monolayer MoS2 crystals on SiO2 and\nhBN substrates using a combination of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, scanning\ntunneling microscopy, optical absorbance, and low-temperature photoluminescence\nmeasurements. We find that the different substrates significantly impact the\noptical properties and the local density of states near the conduction band\nedge observed in tunneling spectra. While the SiO2 substrates induce a large\nbackground doping with electrons and a substantial amount of band tail states\nnear the conduction band edge of MoS2, such states as well as the high doping\ndensity are absent using high quality hBN substrates. By accounting for the\nsubstrate effects we obtain a quasiparticle gap that is in excellent agreement\nwith optical absorbance spectra and we deduce an exciton binding energy of\nabout 480 meV. We identify several intrinsic lattice defects that are\nubiquitious in MoS2, but we find that on hBN substrates the impact of these\ndefects appears to be passivated. We conclude that the choice of substrate\ncontrols both the effects of intrinsic defects and extrinsic disorder, and thus\nthe electronic and optical properties of MoS2. The correlation of substrate\ninduced disorder and defects on the electronic and optical properties of MoS2\ncontributes to an in-depth understanding of the role of the substrates on the\nperformance of 2D materials and will help to further improve the properties of\n2D materials based quantum nanosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 16:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

(2019) demonstrated that\nunsupervised disentanglement learning without inductive biases is theoretically\nimpossible and that existing inductive biases and unsupervised methods do not\nallow to consistently learn disentangled representations. However, in many\npractical settings, one might have access to a limited amount of supervision,\nfor example through manual labeling of (some) factors of variation in a few\ntraining examples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such supervision\non state-of-the-art disentanglement methods and perform a large scale study,\ntraining over 52000 models under well-defined and reproducible experimental\nconditions. We observe that a small number of labeled examples (0.01--0.5\\% of\nthe data set), with potentially imprecise and incomplete labels, is sufficient\nto perform model selection on state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Further, we\ninvestigate the benefit of incorporating supervision into the training process.\nOverall, we empirically validate that with little and imprecise supervision it\nis possible to reliably learn disentangled representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 16:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 13:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

Given a digraph $D=(V(D),A(D))$, a global offensive $k$-alliance in a\ndigraph $D$ is a subset $S\\subseteq V(D)$ such that every vertex outside of $S$\nhas at least one in-neighbor from $S$ and also at least $k$ more in-neighbors\nfrom $S$ than from outside of $S$, by assuming $k$ is an integer lying between\ntwo minus the maximum in-degree of $D$ and the maximum in-degree of $D$. The\nglobal offensive $k$-alliance number $\\gamma_{k}^{o}(D)$ is the minimum\ncardinality among all global offensive $k$-alliances in $D$. In this article we\nbegin the study of the global offensive $k$-alliance number of digraphs. For\ninstance, we prove that finding the global offensive $k$-alliance number of\ndigraphs $D$ is an NP-hard problem for any value $k\\in\n\\{2-\\Delta^-(D),\\dots,\\Delta^-(D)\\}$ and that it remains NP-complete even when\nrestricted to bipartite digraphs when we consider the non-negative values of\n$k$ given in the interval above. Based on these facts, lower bounds on\n$\\gamma_{k}^{o}(D)$ with characterizations of all digraphs attaining the bounds\nare given in this work. We also bound this parameter for bipartite digraphs\nfrom above. For the particular case $k=1$, an immediate result from the\ndefinition shows that $\\gamma(D)\\leq \\gamma_{1}^{o}(D)$ for all digraphs $D$,\nin which $\\gamma(D)$ stands for the domination number of $D$. We show that\nthese two digraph parameters are the same for some infinite families of\ndigraphs like rooted trees and contrafunctional digraphs.

Early prediction of dispersal\nevents is important in mitigating congestion and safety risks and making better\ndispatching decisions for taxi and ride-sharing fleets. Existing work mostly\nfocuses on predicting taxi demand in the near future by learning patterns from\nhistorical data. However, they fail in case of abnormality because dispersal\nevents with abnormally high demand are non-repetitive and violate common\nassumptions such as smoothness in demand change over time. Instead, in this\npaper we argue that dispersal events follow a complex pattern of trips and\nother related features in the past, which can be used to predict such events.\nTherefore, we formulate the dispersal event prediction problem as a survival\nanalysis problem. We propose a two-stage framework (DILSA), where a deep\nlearning model combined with survival analysis is developed to predict the\nprobability of a dispersal event and its demand volume. We conduct extensive\ncase studies and experiments on the NYC Yellow taxi dataset from 2014-2016.\nResults show that DILSA can predict events in the next 5 hours with F1-score of\n0.7 and with average time error of 18 minutes.

We show that the parallel subchannels\nconstituting this setting are separable from a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region\nperspective if and only if the partial CSIT pattern is totally ordered. This\ntotal order condition corresponds to users abiding by the same order, with\nrespect to their CSIT quality levels, in each of the parallel subchannels. For\ninstance, let $\\alpha_{k}^{[l]}$ and $\\alpha_{j}^{[l]}$ be the CSIT quality\nparameters for users $k$ and $j$ over subchannel $l$. Under total order, having\n$\\alpha_{k}^{[l]} \\geq \\alpha_{j}^{[l]}$ implies that $\\alpha_{k}^{[m]} \\geq\n\\alpha_{j}^{[m]}$ holds for every subchannel $m$. In this case, the entire DoF\nregion is achievable using simple separate coding, where a\nsingle-subchannel-type transmission scheme is employed in each subchannel. To\nshow this separability result, we first derive an outer bound for the DoF\nregion by extending the aligned image sets approach of Davoodi and Jafar to the\nconsidered setting. We then show that this outer bound coincides with the inner\nbound achieved through separate coding, given by the Minkowski sum of $M$\nsingle-subchannel DoF regions, under the total order condition, hence settling\nthe if part of the main theorem. To prove the only if part of the theorem, we\nidentify a set of DoF tuples achievable through joint coding across\nsubchannels, yet not achievable through separate coding whenever the total\norder condition is violated.

For\nsystems involving impacts, thresholds, switches, or other abrupt events,\nhowever, this transition can be achieved in fundamentally different ways. This\npaper reviews 20 such `Hopf-like' bifurcations for two-dimensional ODE systems\nwith state-dependent switching rules. The bifurcations include boundary\nequilibrium bifurcations, the collision or change of stability of equilibria or\nfolds on switching manifolds, and limit cycle creation via hysteresis or time\ndelay. In each case a stationary solution changes stability and possibly form,\nand emits one limit cycle. Each bifurcation is analysed quantitatively in a\ngeneral setting: we identify quantities that govern the onset, criticality, and\ngenericity of the bifurcation, and determine scaling laws for the period and\namplitude of the resulting limit cycle.

We validate\nHPC-BBO on the design of the morphology and controller for a simulated 6-legged\nmicrorobot.

We show that\nthis phenomenon is fundamentally stochastic and collective in nature. Indeed,\nfor noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition\nrates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading\nto an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain\nreaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective\nreturn to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed\nperiodic synchronized oscillations.

In this work, we introduce a model-driven framework for the automatic\nannotation of apparent age and gender attributes in large-scale image datasets.\nUsing this framework, we conduct the first demographic audit of the 2012\nImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) subset of ImageNet\nand the \"person\" hierarchical category of ImageNet. We find that 41.62% of\nfaces in ILSVRC appear as female, 1.71% appear as individuals above the age of\n60, and males aged 15 to 29 account for the largest subgroup with 27.11%. We\nnote that the presented model-driven framework is not fair for all\nintersectional groups, so annotation are subject to bias. We present this work\nas the starting point for future development of unbiased annotation models and\nfor the study of downstream effects of imbalances in the demographics of\nImageNet.

These are necessary steps to optimize the spectral transmission profile\nof a two-dimensional spectrograph using one or more FPIs.\n  We devise a generalization of the techniques developed for the so-called\nphase-shifting interferometry to the case of FPIs. The technique is applicable\nto any FPI that can be tuned via changing the cavity spacing ($z$-axis), and\ncan be used for any etalon regardless of the coating' reflectivity. The major\nstrength of our method is the ability to fully characterize the cavity during a\nspectral scan, allowing for the determination of scan-dependent modifications\nof the plates.

A key role in this transition is played by\nsqueezing of the quantum state, which is a result of the strong suppression of\nthe decaying mode component of the perturbations. Motivated by ever improving\nmeasurements of the cosmological perturbations, we ask whether there are\nscenarios where this decaying mode is nevertheless still observable in the late\nUniverse, ideally leading to a ``smoking gun'' signature of the quantum nature\nof the perturbations. We address this question by evolving the quantum state of\nthe perturbations from inflation into the post-inflationary Universe. After\nrecovering the standard result that in slow-roll (SR) inflation the decaying\nmode is indeed hopelessly suppressed by the time the perturbations are observed\n(by $\\sim 115$ orders of magnitude), we turn to ultra slow-roll (USR)\ninflation, a scenario in which the usual decaying mode actually grows on\nsuper-horizon scales. Despite this drastic difference in the behavior of the\nmode functions, we find also in USR that the late-Universe decaying mode\namplitude is dramatically suppressed, in fact by the same $\\sim 115$ orders of\nmagnitude. We finally explain that this large suppression is a general result\nthat holds beyond the SR and USR scenarios considered and follows from a\nmodified version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the observed\namplitude of the primordial power spectrum. The classical behavior of the\nperturbations is thus closely related to the classical behavior of macroscopic\nobjects drawing an analogy with the position of a massive particle, the\ncurvature perturbations today have an enormous effective mass of order $m_{\\rm\npl}^2/H_0^2 \\sim 10^{120}$, making them highly classical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 00:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

The dispersion of the angular\nfrequency results from the distribution of the local field. The transition\nbetween the sites under inhomogeneous static local field induces adiabatic\nrelaxation of the spin. We also considered the on-site inherent (nonadiabatic)\nrelaxation of the spin.

The\nelectromagnetic particles do not reach the ground for very inclined showers. On\nthe contrary, the atmosphere is transparent for the radio emission and its\nfootprint on ground increases with the zenith angle. Therefore, the radio\ntechnique offers a reliable detection over the full range of zenith angles, and\nin particular for inclined showers. In this work, the mass sensitivity of a\ncombination of the radio emission with the muons is investigated in a case\nstudy for the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory using CORSIKA Monte Carlo\nsimulations of showers in the EeV energy range.

To further mitigate this loss, we propose a novel\nsinusoidal regularization, called SinReQ1, for deep quantized training. SinReQ\nadds a periodic term to the original objective function of the underlying\ntraining algorithm. SinReQ exploits the periodicity, differentiability, and the\ndesired convexity profile in sinusoidal functions to automatically propel\nweights towards values that are inherently closer to quantization levels.\nSince, this technique does not require invasive changes to the training\nprocedure, SinReQ can harmoniously enhance quantized training algorithms.\nSinReQ offers generality and flexibility as it is not limited to a certain\nbitwidth or a uniform assignment of bitwidths across layers.

Generalists\ncorrespond to genotypes that remain fit across diverse selective pressures;\ncross-reactive antibodies are much wanted but rare, while multi-drug resistant\nmicrobes are undesired yet prevalent. However, little is known about under what\nconditions such solutions with a high capacity to adapt would be efficiently\ndiscovered by evolution, as environmental changes alter the relative fitness\nand accessibility of neighboring genotypes. In addition, can epistasis --- the\nsource of landscape ruggedness and path constraints --- play a different role,\nif the environments are correlated in time? We present a generative model to\nestimate the propensity of evolving generalists in rugged landscapes that are\ntunably related and cycling relatively slowly. We find that environment cycling\ncan substantially facilitate the search for fit generalists by dynamically\nenlarging their effective basins of attraction. Importantly, these high\nperformers are most likely to emerge at an intermediate level of both\nruggedness and environmental relatedness, trading diversity for fitness and\naccessibility.

However, establishing\nUAV-based mmWave links is quite challenging due to the random fluctuations of\nhovering UAVs which can induce antenna gain mismatch between transmitter and\nreceiver. To assess the benefit of UAV-based mmWave links, in this paper,\ntractable, closed-form statistical channel models are derived for three UAV\ncommunication scenarios: (i) a direct UAV-to-UAV link, (ii) an aerial relay\nlink in which source, relay, and destination are hovering UAVs, and (iii) a\nrelay link in which a hovering UAV connects a ground source to a ground\ndestination. The accuracy of the derived analytical expressions is corroborated\nby performing Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results are then used to study\nthe effect of antenna directivity gain under different channel conditions for\nestablishing reliable UAV-based mmWave links in terms of achieving minimum\noutage probability. It is shown that the performance of such links is largely\ndependent on the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs.

Nevertheless,\nat the high SNR regime, lower antenna directivity gains result in a more\nreliable communication link.

The SMBH is surrounded\nby a broad emission line region (BLR) and a dusty torus. It is difficult to\nstudy the extent of the dusty torus as the central region of AGN is not\nresolvable using any conventional imaging techniques available today. Though,\ncurrent IR interferometric techniques could in principle resolve the torus in\nnearby AGN, it is very expensive and limited to few bright and nearby AGN. A\nmore feasible alternative to the interferometric technique to find the extent\nof the dusty torus in AGN is the technique of reverberation mapping (RM). REMAP\n(REverberation Mapping of AGN Program) is a long term photometric monitoring\nprogram being carried out using the 2 m HCT operated by the IIA, Bangalore,\naimed at measuring the torus size in many AGN using the technique of RM. It\ninvolves accumulation of suitably long and well sampled light curves in the\noptical and near-infrared bands to measure the time delays between the light\ncurves in different wavebands. These delays are used to determine the radius of\nthe inner edge of the dust torus. REMAP was initiated in the year 2016 and\nsince then about one hour of observing time once every five days (weather\npermitting) has been allocated at the HCT. Our initial sample carefully\nselected for this program consists of a total of 8 sources observable using the\nHCT.

The circular\ncross-section of each cylinder varies periodically along its length in a binary\nway, from small to large, while its overall circular symmetry has to be broken\nin order to remove parasitic magnetic modes.

The\nlocations to process are sampled from an attention distribution computed from a\nlow resolution view of the input. We refer to our method as attention sampling\nand it can process images of several megapixels with a standard single GPU\nsetup. We show that sampling from the attention distribution results in an\nunbiased estimator of the full model with minimal variance, and we derive an\nunbiased estimator of the gradient that we use to train our model end-to-end\nwith a normal SGD procedure. This new method is evaluated on three\nclassification tasks, where we show that it allows to reduce computation and\nmemory footprint by an order of magnitude for the same accuracy as classical\narchitectures.

When any\ntwo atoms are less than $1/M$ apart, this recovery problem is highly\nchallenging and many existing algorithms either cannot deal with this situation\nor require restrictive assumptions on the sign of the measure. ESPRIT is an\nefficient method that does not depend on the sign of the measure. This paper\nprovides an explicit error bound on the support matching distance of ESPRIT in\nterms of the minimum singular value of Vandermonde matrices. When the support\nconsists of multiple well-separated clumps and noise is sufficiently small, the\nsupport error by ESPRIT scales like ${\\rm SRF}^{2\\lambda+2} \\times {\\rm\nNoise}$, where the Super-Resolution Factor (${\\rm SRF}$) governs the difficulty\nof the problem and $\\lambda$ is the cardinality of the largest clump. {If the\nsupport contains one clump of closely spaced atoms, the min-max error is ${\\rm\nSRF}^{2\\lambda +2} \\times {\\rm Noise}/M$.

Besides unsatisfactory lightings, multiple types of degradations,\nsuch as noise and color distortion due to the limited quality of cameras, hide\nin the dark. In other words, solely turning up the brightness of dark regions\nwill inevitably amplify hidden artifacts. This work builds a simple yet\neffective network for \\textbf{Kin}dling the \\textbf{D}arkness (denoted as\nKinD), which, inspired by Retinex theory, decomposes images into two\ncomponents. One component (illumination) is responsible for light adjustment,\nwhile the other (reflectance) for degradation removal. In such a way, the\noriginal space is decoupled into two smaller subspaces, expecting to be better\nregularized/learned. It is worth to note that our network is trained with\npaired images shot under different exposure conditions, instead of using any\nground-truth reflectance and illumination information. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our design and its superiority\nover state-of-the-art alternatives.

This emerging role will acquire overwhelming\nimportance if, as a growing body of literature suggests, artificial\nintelligence is underway to outperform human intelligence in most of its\ndimensions, thus becoming \"superintelligence\". Hitherto, the risks posed by\nthis technology have been framed as a technical rather than a political\nchallenge. With the help of a thought experiment, this paper explores the\nenvironmental and social implications of superintelligence emerging in an\neconomy shaped by neoliberal policies. It is argued that such policies\nexacerbate the risk of extremely adverse impacts. The experiment also serves to\nhighlight some serious flaws in the pursuit of economic efficiency and growth\nper se, and suggests that the challenge of superintelligence cannot be\nseparated from the other major environmental and social challenges, demanding a\nfundamental transformation along the lines of degrowth. Crucially, with\nmachines outperforming them in their functions, there is little reason to\nexpect economic elites to be exempt from the threats that superintelligence\nwould pose in a neoliberal context, which opens a door to overcoming vested\ninterests that stand in the way of social change toward sustainability and\nequity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 17:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Many chronic conditions, like\nneurodegenerative diseases and cancers, correlate with complex tissue changes\nthat are difficult to explore using two-dimensional histology.

Three-dimensional microscopy is\ntherefore impractical in clinical settings and often limited to core facilities\nat major research institutions.

In this paper, we\npropose an imaging methodology that enables fast and inexpensive\nthree-dimensional imaging that can be readily integrated into current histology\npipelines.
