We suggest a practical technique that minimizes this\ntrade-off between interpretability and classification accuracy.

Most reports on the pressure-induced spin crossover\nwith a large volume collapse so far focused on compounds with single transition\nmetal. Here we report a comprehensive high-pressure investigation of a mixed\nFe-Mn perovskite La2FeMnO6. Under pressure, the strong coupling between Fe and\nMn leads to a combined valence/spin transition: Fe3+(S = 5/2) to Fe2+(S = 0)\nand Mn3+(S = 2) to Mn4+(S = 3/2), with an isostructural phase transition. The\nspin transitions of both Fe and Mn are offset by ~ 20 GPa of the onset\npressure, and the lattice collapse occurs in between. Interestingly, Fe3+ ion\nshows an abnormal behavior when it reaches a lower valence state (Fe2+)\naccompanied by a + 0.5 eV energy shift in Fe K-absorption edge at 15 GPa. This\nprocess is associated with the charge-spin-orbital state transition from high\nspin Fe3+ to low spin Fe2+, caused by the significantly enhanced t2g-eg crystal\nfield splitting in the compressed lattice under high pressure. Density\nFunctional Theory calculations confirm the energy preference of the\nhigh-pressure state with charge redistribution accompanied by spin state\ntransition of Fe ions. Moreover, La2FeMnO6 maintains semiconductor behaviors\neven when the pressure reached 144.5 GPa as evidenced by the electrical\ntransport measurements, despite the huge resistivity decreasing 7 orders of\nmagnitude compared with that at ambient pressure.

Each peer joining a\nP2P system provides or imports data from its neighbors by using a set of\nmapping rules, i.e. a set of semantic correspondences to a set of peers\nbelonging to the same environment. Two different types of mapping rules are\ndefined: mapping rules allowing to import a maximal set of atoms not leading to\ninconsistency (called maximal mapping rules) and mapping rules allowing to\nimport a minimal set of atoms needed to restore consistency (called minimal\nmapping rules). Implicitly, the use of maximal mapping rules states it is\npreferable to import as long as no inconsistencies arise; whereas the use of\nminimal mapping rules states that it is preferable not to import unless a\ninconsistency exists. The paper presents three different declarative semantics\nof a P2P system: (i) the Max Weak Model Semantics, in which mapping rules are\nused to import as much knowledge as possible} from a peer's neighborhood\nwithout violating local integrity constraints; (ii) the Min Weak Model\nSemantics, in which the P2P system can be locally inconsistent and the\ninformation provided by the neighbors is used to restore consistency, that is\nto only integrate the missing portion of a correct, but incomplete database;\n(iii) the Max-Min Weak Model Semantics that unifies the previous two different\nperspectives captured by the Max Weak Model Semantics and Min Weak Model\nSemantics.

Yet, few studies have analyzed\nsystematically the effect of the non-uniformity in the distribution of texture\nand surface tension of substrates on its wetting properties. In this work we\ninvestigate this issue theoretically and numerically. We propose a continuous\nmodel that takes into account the total energy required to create interfaces of\na droplet in two possible wetting states: Cassie-Baxter(CB) with air pockets\ntrapped underneath the droplet; and the other characterized by the homogeneous\nwetting of the surface, the Wenzel(W) state. To introduce geometrical\nnon-regularity we suppose that pillar heights and pillar distances are Gaussian\ndistributed instead of having a constant value. Similarly, we suppose a\nheterogeneous distribution of Young's angle on the surface to take into account\nthe chemical non-uniformity. This allows to vary the \"amount\" of disorder by\nchanging the variance of the distribution. We first solve this model\nanalytically and then we also propose a numerical version of it, which can be\napplied to study any type of disorder. In both versions, we employ the same\nphysical idea: the energies of both states are minimized to predict the\nthermodynamic wetting state of the droplet for a given volume and surface\ntexture. We find that the main effect of disorder is to induce the stability of\nboth wetting states on the same substrate. In terms of the influence of the\ndisorder on the contact angle of the droplet, we find that it is negligible for\nthe chemical disorder and for pillar-distance disorder. However, in the case of\npillar-height disorder, it is observed that the average contact angle of the\ndroplet increases with the amount of disorder. We end the paper investigating\nhow the region of stability of both wetting states behaves when the droplet\nvolume changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 19:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

We show that vector\ncomponent generation of KS hypergraphs exhausts all possible vectors that can\nbe constructed from chosen vector components, in contrast to previous studies\nthat used incomplete lists of vectors and therefore missed a majority of\nhypergraphs. Consequently, this unified method is far more efficient for\ngenerations of KS sets and their implementation in quantum computation and\nquantum communication.

The macroscopic\ntraffic dynamics are described by the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model respectively\nfor both the fast and slow lanes. The traffic density and velocity of each of\nthe two lanes are governed by coupled $2 \\times 2$ nonlinear hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). Lane-changing interactions between the two lanes\nlead to exchanging source terms between the two pairs second-order PDEs.\nTherefore, we are dealing with $4 \\times 4$ nonlinear coupled hyperbolic PDEs.\nBased on driver's preference for the slow and fast lanes, a reference system of\nlane-specific uniform steady states in congested traffic is chosen. To\nstabilize traffic densities and velocities of both lanes to the steady states,\ntwo distinct variable speed limits (VSL) are applied at outlet boundary,\ncontrolling the traffic velocity of each lane. Using backstepping\ntransformation, we map the coupled heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE system into\na cascade target system, in which traffic oscillations are damped out through\nactuation of the velocities at the downstream boundary. Two full-state feedback\nboundary control laws are developed. We also design a collocated boundary\nobserver for state estimation with sensing of densities at the outlet. Output\nfeedback boundary controllers are obtained by combining the collocated observer\nand full-state feedback controllers. The finite time convergence to equilibrium\nis achieved for both the controllers and observer designs. Numerical\nsimulations validate our design in two different traffic scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 00:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

By\nimposing repetition condition on this equation, we reach to a significant\nfinding named Simple and Compound Motion Cycles as general solutions of steady\nwalking. Among motion cycles, Simple Forward Motion Cycle represents normal\nwalking pattern. These cycles have marginal stability that in practice cause\nthe motion to diverge exponentially even under slight disturbance.

In most of the proposed methods by researchers, to\nmaintain the stability of walking bipedal robots, it has been tried to ensure\nthe momentary stability of motion by limiting the motion to multiple\nconstraints. Although these methods have good performance in sustaining\nstability, they leave the robot away from the natural movement of humans, with\nlow efficiency and high energy consumption. Hence, many researchers have turned\nto the walking techniques that follow a certain motion limit cycle, in which we\ncan consider the overall stability rather than momentary. In this paper, a\nmethod is proposed to maintain the stability of the limit cycle against\ndisturbance. For this purpose, the dynamical model of the biped robot is\nextracted in the space of total momentum variables and, according to the\ndesired step length and speed, the motion limit cycle is designed.\nSubsequently, a motion stabilizer is proposed based on the idea of length\nshift, which is a natural human strategy for sustaining the balance in case of\nimpact. The simulations show that this technique has a good performance in\nmaintaining the stability of motion and has similar responses to human\nresponse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 03:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 12:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Although a vast body of literature exists,\nfew methods exploit these undetermined relationships for visual relationship\ndetection.\n  In this paper, we explore the beneficial effect of undetermined relationships\non visual relationship detection. We propose a novel multi-modal feature based\nundetermined relationship learning network (MF-URLN) and achieve great\nimprovements in relationship detection. In detail, our MF-URLN automatically\ngenerates undetermined relationships by comparing object pairs with\nhuman-notated data according to a designed criterion.

Further, the MF-URLN proposes two\ncorrelated subnetworks: one subnetwork decides the determinate confidence, and\nthe other predicts the relationships. We evaluate the MF-URLN on two datasets:\nthe Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) and the Visual Genome (VG) datasets.\nThe experimental results compared with state-of-the-art methods verify the\nsignificant improvements made by the undetermined relationships, e.g., the\ntop-50 relation detection recall improves from 19.5% to 23.9% on the VRD\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 03:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

It has been\nrecently shown (Monemizadeh et al. 2017) that for bounded-degree graphs, any\nconstant-query tester can be emulated in the random order streaming model by a\nstreaming algorithm that uses only space required to store a constant number of\nwords. However, in a more natural setting of general graphs, with no\nrestriction on the maximum degree, no such results were known because of our\nlack of understanding of constant-query testers in general graphs and lack of\ntechniques to appropriately emulate in the streaming setting off-line\nalgorithms allowing many high-degree vertices.\n  In this work we advance our understanding on both of these challenges. First,\nwe provide canonical testers for all constant-query testers for general graphs,\nboth, for one-sided and two-sided errors. Such canonizations were only known\nbefore (in the adjacency matrix model) for dense graphs (Goldreich and Trevisan\n2003) and (in the adjacency list model) for bounded degree (di-)graphs\n(Goldreich and Ron 2011, Czumaj et al. 2016). Using the concept of canonical\ntesters, we then prove that every property of general graphs that is\nconstant-query testable with one-sided error can also be tested in\nconstant-space with one-sided error in the random order streaming model.\n  Our results imply, among others, that properties like $(s,t)$\ndisconnectivity, $k$-path-freeness, etc. are constant-space testable in random\norder streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 10:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

Nevertheless,\nthe high dimension of hyperspectral data makes it difficult to implement\ntraditional CD algorithms.

In order to achieve our goal, we learn to extract,\ndirectly from a video, a high-level latent motion representation, which is\ninvariant to the skeleton geometry and the camera view. Our key idea is to\ntrain a deep neural network to decompose temporal sequences of 2D poses into\nthree components: motion, skeleton, and camera view-angle. Having extracted\nsuch a representation, we are able to re-combine motion with novel skeletons\nand camera views, and decode a retargeted temporal sequence, which we compare\nto a ground truth from a synthetic dataset. We demonstrate that our framework\ncan be used to robustly extract human motion from videos, bypassing 3D\nreconstruction, and outperforming existing retargeting methods, when applied to\nvideos in-the-wild. It also enables additional applications, such as\nperformance cloning, video-driven cartoons, and motion retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 13:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

So far, we presented algorithms\nfor ASP for the full ASP-Core-2 syntax, which is competitive especially when it\ncomes to counting answer sets. Since dynamic programming on tree decomposition\nlands itself well to counting, we designed a framework for projected model\ncounting, which applies to ASP, abstract argumentation and even to problems\nhigher in the polynomial hierarchy.

Some calculation\nresults on the Wiener complexity and the Wiener index of fullerene graphs of\norder $n \\le 216$ are presented. Structure of graphs with the maximal Wiener\ncomplexity or the maximal Wiener index is discussed and formulas for the Wiener\nindex of several families of graphs are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 15:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

However,\napproximation by neural networks depending on n parameters is a form of\nnonlinear approximation and as such should be compared with other nonlinear\nmethods such as variable knot splines or n-term approximation from\ndictionaries.

Matrix Anal. Appl.,\n39-4 (2018), pp. 1726-1749] is adapted to efficiently calculate the dispersion\nrelation curve for linear surface waves on an arbitrary vertical shear current.\nThis is equivalent to solving the Rayleigh instability equation with linearised\nfree-surface boundary condition for each sought point on the curve. Taking\nadvantage of the analyticity of the dispersion relation, a path-following or\ncontinuation approach is adopted. The problem is discretized using a\ncollocation scheme, parametrised along either a radial or angular path in the\nwave vector plane, and differentiated to yield a system of ODEs. After an\ninitial eigenproblem solve using QZ decomposition, numerical integration\nproceeds along the curve using linear solves as the Runge--Kutta $F(\\cdot)$\nfunction; thus, many QZ decompositions on a $2N$ companion matrix are exchanged\nfor one QZ decomposition and a small number of linear solves on a size $N$\nmatrix. A piecewise interpolant provides dense output. The integration\nrepresents a nominal setup cost afterwhich very many points can be computed at\nnegligible cost whilst preserving high accuracy. Furthermore, a 2-dimensional\ninterpolant suitable for scattered data query points in the wave vector plane\nis described. Finally, a comparison is made with existing numerical methods for\nthis problem, revealing that the path-following scheme is asymptotically two\norders of magnitude faster in number of query points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 04:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

It is well known that\nthe rational closure does not allow an independent handling of the inheritance\nof different defeasible properties of concepts. Several solutions have been\nproposed to face this problem and the lexicographic closure is the most notable\none. In this work, we consider an alternative closure construction, called the\nMulti Preference closure (MP-closure), that has been first considered for\nreasoning with exceptions in DLs. Here, we reconstruct the notion of MP-closure\nin the propositional case and we show that it is a natural variant of Lehmann's\nlexicographic closure. Abandoning Maximal Entropy (an alternative route already\nconsidered but not explored by Lehmann) leads to a construction which exploits\na different lexicographic ordering w.r.t. the lexicographic closure, and\ndetermines a preferential consequence relation rather than a rational\nconsequence relation. We show that, building on the MP-closure semantics,\nrationality can be recovered, at least from the semantic point of view,\nresulting in a rational consequence relation which is stronger than the\nrational closure, but incomparable with the lexicographic closure.

In this paper we introduce a third possible cause,\nnamely random \"manufacturing\" discrepancies with respect to ``design'' values.\nA clear way to demonstrate the existence of this component is to ``shut'' the\ntwo others and to see whether or not there is remaining variability. Perfect\nclones raised under well controlled laboratory conditions fulfill the\nconditions for such a test. Carried out for four different species, the test\nreveals a variability remainder of the order of 10%-20% in terms of coefficient\nof variation. As an example, the CV of the volume of E.coli bacteria\nimmediately after binary fission is of the order of 10%. In short,\n``manufacturing'' discrepancies occur randomly, even when no harmful mutation\nor environmental factors are involved. Not surprisingly, there is a strong\nconnection between congenital defects and infant mortality. In the wake of\nbirth there is a gradual elimination of defective units and this screening\naccounts for the post-natal fall of infant mortality. Apart from this trend,\npost-natal death rates also have humps and peaks associated with various\ninabilities and defects.\\qL In short, infant mortality rates convert the\ncase-by-case and mostly qualitative problem of congenital malformations into a\nglobal quantitative effect which, so to say, summarizes and registers what goes\nwrong in the embryonic phase. Based on the natural assumption that for simple\norganisms (e.g. rotifers) the manufacturing processes are shorter than for more\ncomplex organisms (e.g. mammals), fewer congenital anomalies are expected.\nSomehow, this feature should be visible on the infant mortality rate. How this\nconjecture can be tested is outlined in our conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 13:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

A worst case scenario is assumed, in the sense that, in order to\nenhance their interception ability all eavesdroppers are located close to each\nother, near the controller and collude to form joint receive beamforming. For\nsuch a system, a novel cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) secure\ntransmission scheme for which an IoT device with a stronger channel condition\nacts as an energy harvesting relay in order to assist a second IoT device\noperating under weaker channel conditions, is proposed and its performance is\nanalyzed and evaluated. A secrecy sum rate (SSR) maximization problem is\nformulated and solved under three constraints: i) Transmit power; ii)\nSuccessive interference cancellation; iii) Quality of Service. By considering\nboth passive and active eavesdroppers scenarios, two optimization schemes are\nproposed to improve the overall system SSR. On the one hand, for the passive\neavesdropper scenario, an artificial noise-aided secure beamforming scheme is\nproposed. Since this optimization problem is nonconvex, instead of using\ntraditional but highly complex, bruteforce two-dimensional search, it is\nconveniently transformed into a convex one by using an epigraph reformulation.\nOn the other hand, for the active multi-antennas eavesdroppers' scenario, the\northogonal-projection-based beamforming scheme is considered, and by employing\nthe successive convex approximation method, a suboptimal solution is proposed.\nFurthermore, since for single antenna transmission the\northogonal-projection-based scheme may not be applicable a simple power control\nscheme is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 10:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

By applying scalable video\ncoding (SVC), each video file to be requested is divided into one base layer\n(BL) and several enhancement layers (ELs). In order to assign different\ntransmission tasks, the serving small-cell base stations (SBSs) are grouped\ninto K clusters. The SBSs are able to cache and cooperatively transmit BL and\nEL contents to the user. We analytically derive the expressions for successful\ntransmission probability and ergodic service rate, and then the closed form of\nEConomical Efficiency (ECE) is obtained. In order to enhance the ECE\nperformance, we formulate the ECE optimization problems for two cases. In the\nfirst case, with equal cache size equipped at each SBS, the layer caching\nindicator is determined. Since this problem is NP-hard, after the l0-norm\napproximation, the discrete optimization variables are relaxed to be\ncontinuous, and this relaxed problem is convex. Next, based on the optimal\nsolution derived from the relaxed problem, we devise a greedystrategy based\nheuristic algorithm to achieve the near-optimal layer caching indicators. In\nthe second case, the cache size for each SBS, the layer size and the layer\ncaching indicator are jointly optimized. This problem is a mixed integer\nprogramming problem, which is more challenging. To effectively solve this\nproblem, the original ECE maximization problem is divided into two subproblems.\nThese two subproblems are iteratively solved until the original optimization\nproblem is convergent. Numerical results verify the correctness of theoretical\nderivations. Additionally, compared to the most popular layer placement\nstrategy, the performance superiority of the proposed SVC-based caching schemes\nis testified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 10:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}
