The thermal conductivity of composites with a\nmoderate graphene concentration of ~15 wt% exhibits an abrupt increase as the\nloading of copper nanoparticles approaches ~40 wt%, followed by saturation.

Various lexicon-driven approaches to\nChinese segmentation, e.g. [1,16], achieve high f-scores yet require massive\ntraining for any variation. Text-driven approach, e.g. [12], can be easily\nadapted for domain and genre changes yet has difficulty matching the high\nf-scores of the lexicon-driven approaches. In this paper, we refine and\nimplement an innovative text-driven word boundary decision (WBD) segmentation\nmodel proposed in [15]. The WBD model treats word segmentation simply and\nefficiently as a binary decision on whether to realize the natural textual\nbreak between two adjacent characters as a word boundary. The WBD model allows\nsimple and quick training data preparation converting characters as contextual\nvectors for learning the word boundary decision. Machine learning experiments\nwith four different classifiers show that training with 1,000 vectors and 1\nmillion vectors achieve comparable and reliable results. In addition, when\napplied to SigHAN Bakeoff 3 competition data, the WBD model produces OOV recall\nrates that are higher than all published results. Unlike all previous work, our\nOOV recall rate is comparable to our own F-score. Both experiments support the\nclaim that the WBD model is a realistic model for Chinese word segmentation as\nit can be easily adapted for new variants with the robust result. In\nconclusion, we will discuss linguistic ramifications as well as future\nimplications for the WBD approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 16:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

In this paper, we propose an attack based on the extraction of\ninter-keystroke timing from the feedback sound when users type their PINs. Our\nattack is able to reach an accuracy of 98% with a mean error of 0.13 +/-6.66\nmilliseconds. We demonstrate that inter-keystroke timing significantly improves\nthe guessing probability of certain subsets of PINs. We believe this represents\na security problem that has to be taken into account for secure PIN generation.\nFurthermore, we identified several attack scenarios where the adversary can\nexploit inter-keystroke timing and additional information about the user or the\nPIN, such as typing behavior.

The success of translation mainly relies on the network\narchitecture to reserve the structural information while modify the appearance\nslightly at the pixel level through adversarial training. Although these\nnetworks are able to learn the mapping, the translated images are predictable\nwithout exclusion. It is more desirable to diversify them using image-to-image\ntranslation by introducing uncertainties, i.e., the generated images hold\npotential for variations in colors and textures in addition to the general\nsimilarity to the input images, and this happens in both the target and source\ndomains. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)\nbased model, InjectionGAN, to learn a many-to-many mapping. In this model, the\ninput image is combined with latent variables, which comprise of\ndomain-specific attribute and unspecific random variations. The domain-specific\nattribute indicates the target domain of the translation, while the unspecific\nrandom variations introduce uncertainty into the model. A unified framework is\nproposed to regroup these two parts and obtain diverse generations in each\ndomain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the diverse generations have\nhigh quality for the challenging image-to-image translation tasks where no\npairing information of the training dataset exits. Both quantitative and\nqualitative results prove the superior performance of InjectionGAN over the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 17:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Characterising such buckling\ngenerally requires detailed analysis. Here, we follow a complementary approach,\napplicable to axisymmetric systems. It aims to predict the qualitative nature\nof any buckling using only the simple axisymmetric geometry of the initial\nsystem. We view an axisymmetric deformation according to the displacement it\nimposes on the radial lines making up the sheet. Thus, e.g., in-plane tensile\nloads on a disk-shaped annulus move radial lines along their length. Any\ncompressional strain present in this deformed state then implies\nsymmetry-breaking buckling out of the original plane. Using only these radial\nmotions, we account for the buckling predicted by more detailed analysis: axial\nwrinkling confined to the inner part of the annulus. A second type of imposed\ndeformation on radial lines is motion normal to the sheet. Considering the\nstrains induced by rotating these lines through some common angle $\\alpha$, one\nmay similarly account for both the buckling of d-cones and that of curved\ncreases.

With more aggressive methods proposed, adversarial attacks can\nbe also applied to the physical world, causing practical issues to various CNN\npowered applications. To secure CNNs, adversarial attack detection is\nconsidered as the most critical approach. However, most existing works focus on\nsuperficial patterns and merely search a particular method to differentiate the\nadversarial inputs and natural inputs, ignoring the analysis of CNN inner\nvulnerability. Therefore, they can only target to specific physical adversarial\nattacks, lacking expected versatility to different attacks. To address this\nissue, we propose DoPa -- a comprehensive CNN detection methodology for various\nphysical adversarial attacks. By interpreting the CNN's vulnerability, we find\nthat non-semantic adversarial perturbations can activate CNN with significantly\nabnormal activations and even overwhelm other semantic input patterns'\nactivations. Therefore, we add a self-verification stage to analyze the\nsemantics of distinguished activation patterns, which improves the CNN\nrecognition process. We apply such a detection methodology into both image and\naudio CNN recognition scenarios.

We discuss the viable parameter space, finding that light dark\nmatter masses within a few orders of magnitude of the fuzzy limit are\npreferred, and discuss the associated signals with this type of solution to the\nstrong CP problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 18:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 20:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

N11 was previously mapped at the lowest rotational transitions of\n$^{12}$CO (J=1--0 and 2--1), and in some particular regions pointings of the\n$^{13}$CO J=1--0 and 2--1 lines were also performed. Using ASTE we mapped the\nwhole extension of the N11 nebula in the $^{12}$CO J=3--2 line, and three\nsub-regions in the $^{13}$CO J=3--2 line. The regions mapped in the $^{13}$CO\nJ=3--2 were selected based on that they may be exposed to the radiation at\ndifferent ways: a region lying over the nebula related to the OB association\nLH10 (N11B), another one that it is associated with the southern part of the\nnebula related to the OB association LH13 (N11D), and finally a farther area at\nthe southwest without any embedded OB association (N11I). We found that the\nmorphology of the molecular clouds lying in each region shows some signatures\nthat could be explained by the expansion of the nebulae and the action of the\nradiation.

The issue\ncan be broken down into two distinct questions: 1) Can galaxy mergers trigger\nAGN? 2) Are galaxy mergers the dominant AGN triggering mechanism? A complete\npicture of the AGN-merger connection requires that both of these questions are\naddressed with the same dataset. In previous work, we have shown that galaxy\nmergers selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) show an excess of\nboth optically-selected, and mid-IR colour-selected AGN, demonstrating that the\nanswer to the first of the above questions is affirmative.

Only ~30\nper cent of optical AGN host galaxies are morphologically disturbed, indicating\nthat recent interactions are not the dominant trigger. However, almost 60 per\ncent of mid-IR AGN hosts show signs of visual disturbance, indicating that\ninteractions play a more significant role in nuclear feeding.

This paper presents the\nimprovements and introduces some new related data mining tools developed during\nthe last five years.

This meta-data index collection is daily\nupdated (since 2014) by a crawler which performs automated query of five major\ncollections.

However, this loses\nuseful information if the classifier has learnt the current concept well, and\nthis concept will recur again in the future. Some frameworks retain and reuse\nclassifiers, but it can be time-consuming to select an appropriate classifier\nto reuse. These frameworks rarely match the accuracy of state-of-the-art\nensemble approaches. For many data stream tasks, speed is important: fast,\naccurate frameworks are needed for time-dependent applications. We propose the\nEnhanced Concept Profiling Framework (ECPF), which aims to recognise recurring\nconcepts and reuse a classifier trained previously, enabling accurate\nclassification immediately following a drift. The novelty of ECPF is in how it\nuses similarity of classifications on new data, between a new classifier and\nexisting classifiers, to quickly identify the best classifier to reuse. It\nalways trains both a new classifier and a reused classifier, and retains the\nmore accurate classifier when concept drift occurs. Finally, it creates a copy\nof reused classifiers, so a classifier well-suited for a recurring concept will\nnot be impacted by being trained on a different concept. In our experiments,\nECPF classifies significantly more accurately than a state-of-the-art\nclassifier reuse framework (Diversity Pool) and a state-of-the-art ensemble\ntechnique (Adaptive Random Forest) on synthetic datasets with recurring\nconcepts. It classifies real-world datasets five times faster than Diversity\nPool, and six times faster than Adaptive Random Forest and is not significantly\nless accurate than either.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 20:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

These requirements are in\nconflict with the typical operation mode of the TRIUMF cyclotron which delivers\nnearly continuous beam to multiple users.

Using\nfinite-element simulation we predict the signal when two wires are set in\nmotion by applying and holding a DC voltage between them (electrostatic\nexcitation). The resulting current signal is marginal. However, the program\nrelates voltage, oscillation amplitude and signal, and it is easy to get enough\namplitude (of order microns) by gently tapping the wire frame. We perform an\nend-to-end experimental test. Four 1.5m wires, at various tensions around 5N,\nare mounted in an aluminum channel. They are connected to a low-noise, balanced\ncurrent-to-voltage preamp designed for good common-mode rejection. The 150V\nbias, from 9V batteries in series, is built into the preamp. Data are taken\nwith a Tektronix 1202B scope, stored on a USB flash drive, and transferred to a\nlaptop computer for analysis. Ten measurements, each with 2500 samples spanning\n1s, are taken for each of the three wire pairs. The wires are excited by\ntapping the frame with a small mallet. Because the wire tensions are different,\nthe waveforms exhibit beats. The data are analyzed by a program which\ndecomposes the waveform step by step to extract the base and beat frequencies\nand thereby, two resonant frequencies per wire pair. Finally, those frequencies\nare disambiguated to obtain the frequency for each wire, which is then\nconverted to a tension. The four tensions are then found mechanically by\nmeasuring the g/mm required to deflect each wire at its midpoint. The two\nvalues of tension agree well. We conclude that the method verifies tension to\napproximately 2% (1 sigma) in a little over 1s for 1.5m wires, and would be\nfaster for shorter wires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 22:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

A quantum kinetic\nequation using a two-particle irreducible formalism is derived. Conservation of\nenergy, particle-number, and momentum emerge naturally, with the conserved\ncurrents depending on both the electron Green's functions and the Green's\nfunctions for the superconducting fluctuations. The quantum kinetic equation is\nemployed to derive a kinetic equation for the current, and the transient\noptical conductivity relevant to pump-probe spectroscopy is studied.

We had limited demographic data available from the population, and\nrelied upon a) the model, b) age-at-harvest data, and c) informative prior\ndistributions from a literature review. The estimated posterior means and\ndistributions for abundance and demographic parameters from our models were\nreasonable for each management zone, and indicated a decreasing trend in zones\nA and B, and a generally stable trend in zones C and D. The age-at-harvest data\nupdated the posterior distribution and means for initial population size,\nharvest season survival, and non-harvest season survival, with a notable\nincrease in precision for the survival values. A strength of the model for\nmanagers is the formalized process for providing biologically supported\ninformation as prior distributions to transparently accommodate expert opinion\nwith measures of confidence when estimating wildlife populations, which can\nthen be updated by the age-at-harvest data and model structure. The integration\nof prior information and age-at-harvest state-space models in a Bayesian\nframework efficiently leverage all available information for making\nzone-specific abundance estimates for the management of harvested species.

The two domains often lie in different feature\nspaces due to diverse data collection methods, which leads to the more\nchallenging task of heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). A core issue of HDA\nis how to preserve the information of the original data during adaptation. In\nthis paper, we propose a joint information preservation method to deal with the\nproblem. The method preserves the information of the original data from two\naspects. On the one hand, although paired samples often exist between the two\ndomains of the HDA, current algorithms do not utilize such information\nsufficiently. The proposed method preserves the paired information by\nmaximizing the correlation of the paired samples in the shared subspace. On the\nother hand, the proposed method improves the strategy of preserving the\nstructural information of the original data, where the local and global\nstructural information are preserved simultaneously. Finally, the joint\ninformation preservation is integrated by distribution matching.

However, the\ninteraction structures among oscillators are static in most of studies on\nchimera state. In this work, we consider a population of agents. Each agent\ncarries a phase oscillator. We assume that agents perform Brownian motions on a\nring and interact with each other with a kernel function dependent on the\ndistance between them. When agents are motionless, the model allows for several\ndynamical states including two different chimera states (the type-I and the\ntype-II chimeras). The movement of agents changes the relative positions among\nthem and produces perpetual noise to impact on the model dynamics. We find that\nthe response of the coupled phase oscillators to the movement of agents depends\non both the phase lag $\\alpha$, determining the stabilities of chimera states,\nand the agent mobility $D$. For low mobility, the synchronous state transits to\nthe type-I chimera state for $\\alpha$ close to $\\pi/2$ and attracts other\ninitial states otherwise. For intermediate mobility, the coupled oscillators\nrandomly jump among different dynamical states and the jump dynamics depends on\n$\\alpha$.

About 13,700 spectra (30\nhours in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the\ninterpretation in terms of quasi-parallel whistler waves.

MinHash is a well-known technique for approximating Jaccard\nsimilarity of sets and has been successfully used for many applications such as\nsimilarity search and large scale learning. Its two compressed versions, b-bit\nMinHash and Odd Sketch, can significantly reduce the memory usage of the\noriginal MinHash method, especially for estimating high similarities (i.e.,\nsimilarities around 1). Although MinHash can be applied to static sets as well\nas streaming sets, of which elements are given in a streaming fashion and\ncardinality is unknown or even infinite, unfortunately, b-bit MinHash and Odd\nSketch fail to deal with streaming data. To solve this problem, we design a\nmemory efficient sketch method, MaxLogHash, to accurately estimate Jaccard\nsimilarities in streaming sets. Compared to MinHash, our method uses smaller\nsized registers (each register consists of less than 7 bits) to build a compact\nsketch for each set. We also provide a simple yet accurate estimator for\ninferring Jaccard similarity from MaxLogHash sketches. In addition, we derive\nformulas for bounding the estimation error and determine the smallest necessary\nmemory usage (i.e., the number of registers used for a MaxLogHash sketch) for\nthe desired accuracy. We conduct experiments on a variety of datasets, and\nexperimental results show that our method MaxLogHash is about 5 times more\nmemory efficient than MinHash with the same accuracy and computational cost for\nestimating high similarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 06:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

One of the major roadblocks in\nenabling high data rates in FD systems is the inter-user interference (IUI) due\nto activating pairs of uplink and downlink users at the same time-frequency\nresource block. Opportunistic user scheduling has been proposed as a means to\nmanage IUI and fully exploit the multiplexing gains in FD systems. In this\npaper, scheduling under long-term and short-term temporal fairness for\nsingle-cell FD wireless networks is considered. Temporal fair scheduling is of\ninterest in delay-sensitive applications, and leads to predictable latency and\npower consumption. The feasible region of user temporal demand vectors is\nderived, and a scheduling strategy maximizing the system utility while\nsatisfying long-term temporal fairness is proposed. Furthermore, a short-term\ntemporal fair scheduling strategy is devised which satisfies user temporal\ndemands over a finite window-length. It is shown that the strategy achieves\noptimal average system utility as the window-length is increased\nasymptotically. Subsequently, practical construction algorithms for long-term\nand short-term temporal fair scheduling are introduced. Simulations are\nprovided to verify the derivations and investigate the multiplexing gains.

Relative dominance of these components is known to\ncorrelate with the total mass of the galaxy, and produces a remarkable\nmorphological variety of spiral galaxies. Although there are many formation\nscenarios regarding individual components, no unified theory exists which\nexplains this systematic variation. The cold-flow hypothesis predicts that\ngalaxies grow by accretion of cold gas from cosmic webs (cold accretion) when\ntheir mass is below a certain threshold, whereas in the high-mass regime the\ngas that entered the dark matter halo is first heated by shock waves to high\ntemperatures and then accretes to the forming galaxy as it cools emitting\nradiation (cooling flow). This hypothesis also predicts that massive galaxies\nat high redshifts have a hybrid accretion structure in which filaments of cold\ninflowing gas penetrate surrounding hot gas. In the case of Milky Way, the\nprevious study suggested that the cold accretion created its thick disc in\nearly times and the cooling flow formed the thin disc in later epochs. Here we\nreport that extending this idea to galaxies with various masses and associating\nthe hybrid accretion with the formation of bulges reproduces the observed\nmass-dependent structures of spiral galaxies: namely, more massive galaxies\nhave lower thick disc mass fractions and higher bulge mass fractions. The\nproposed scenario predicts that thick discs are older in age and poorer in iron\nthan thin discs, the trend observed in the Milky Way (MW) and other spiral\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 07:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

One way to obtain\ninformation on the large-scale structure of the coronal magnetic field is to\nextrapolate it from photospheric data and compare the results with\ncoronagraphic images. Our aim is to verify if this comparison can be a fast\nmethod to check systematically the reliability of the many methods available to\nreconstruct the coronal magnetic field. Coronal fields are usually extrapolated\nfrom photospheric measurements typically in a region close to the central\nmeridian on the solar disk and then compared with coronagraphic images at the\nlimbs, acquired at least 7 days before or after to account for solar rotation,\nimplicitly assuming that no significant changes occurred in the corona during\nthat period. In this work, we combine images from three coronagraphs\n(SOHO/LASCO-C2 and the two STEREO/SECCHI-COR1) observing the Sun from different\nviewing angles to build Carrington maps covering the entire corona to reduce\nthe effect of temporal evolution to ~ 5 days.

However, owing to two stacked generative\nnetworks, the coarse-to-fine network needs numerous computational resources\nsuch as convolution operations and network parameters, which result in low\nspeed. To address this problem, we propose a novel network architecture called\nPEPSI: parallel extended-decoder path for semantic inpainting network, which\naims at reducing the hardware costs and improving the inpainting performance.\nPEPSI consists of a single shared encoding network and parallel decoding\nnetworks called coarse and inpainting paths. The coarse path produces a\npreliminary inpainting result to train the encoding network for the prediction\nof features for the CAM. Simultaneously, the inpainting path generates higher\ninpainting quality using the refined features reconstructed via the CAM.

Our algorithm\nhas a pseudo-near-linear time complexity on average (over all possible\nrealistic inputs) with respect to the number of clients and the number of\npossible unit allocations. In the worst case, it is quadratic with respect to\nthe number of possible allocations. Our experiments validate our analysis and\nshow near-linear complexity. This is in contrast to the unbounded,\nnonpolynomial complexity of known solutions, which do not scale well for a\nlarge number of agents.\n  For a single resource and concave valuations, our algorithm reproduces the\nresults of a well-known algorithm. It does so, however, without subjecting the\nvaluations to any restrictions and supports a multiple resource auction, which\nimproves the social welfare over a combination of single-resource auctions by a\nfactor of 2.5-50. This makes our algorithm applicable to real clients in a real\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 08:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

First, in the KT-$0$ version of\nBCC$(1)$, in which nodes are aware of neighbors only through port numbers, we\nshow an $\\Omega(\\log n)$ round lower bound for CONNECTIVITY even for\nconstant-error randomized Monte Carlo algorithms. The deterministic version of\nthis result can be obtained via the well-known \"edge-crossing\" argument, but,\nthe randomized version of this result requires establishing new combinatorial\nresults regarding the indistinguishability graph induced by inputs. In our\nsecond result, we show that the $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound result extends to\nthe KT-$1$ version of the BCC$(1)$ model, in which nodes are aware of IDs of\nall neighbors, though our proof works only for deterministic algorithms. Since\nnodes know IDs of their neighbors in the KT-$1$ model, it is no longer possible\nto play \"edge-crossing\" tricks; instead we present a reduction from the 2-party\ncommunication complexity problem PARTITION in which Alice and Bob are give two\nset partitions on $[n]$ and are required to determine if the join of these two\nset partitions equals the trivial one-part set partition. While our KT-$1$\nCONNECTIVITY lower bound holds only for deterministic algorithms, in our third\nresult we extend this $\\Omega(\\log n)$ KT-1 lower bound to constant-error Monte\nCarlo algorithms for the closely related CONNECTED COMPONENTS problem. We use\ninformation-theoretic techniques to obtain this result. All our results hold\nfor the seemingly easy special case of CONNECTIVITY in which an algorithm has\nto distinguish an instance with one cycle from an instance with multiple\ncycles. Our results showcase three rather different lower bound techniques and\nlay the groundwork for further improvements in lower bounds for CONNECTIVITY in\nthe BCC$(1)$ model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 08:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

However, validating the safety of automated vehicles is still an\nunsolved problem. While the scenario-based test approach seems to provide a\npossible solution, it requires the execution of a high amount of test cases.\nSeveral test benches, from actual test vehicles to partly or fully simulated\nenvironments, are available, but choosing the optimal test bench, e.g. in terms\nof required execution time and costs, is a difficult task. Every test bench\nprovides different elements, e.g. simulation models which can be used for test\ncase execution. The composition of elements at a specific test bench is called\ntest bench configuration. This test bench configuration determines the actual\nperformance of a test bench and, therefore, whether the run of a particular\ntest case provides valid test case results with respect to the intended\npurpose, e.g. a safety validation. For an effective and efficient test case\nexecution, a method is required to assign test cases to the most appropriate\ntest bench configuration. Therefore, it is indispensable to have a method to\nclassify test bench configurations in a clear and reproducible manner. In this\npaper, we propose a method for classifying test benches and test bench\nconfigurations and illustrate the classification method with some examples. The\nclassification method serves as a basis for a systematic assignment of test\ncases to test bench configurations which allows for an effective and efficient\ntest case execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 08:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

We achieve this by i) adding support to Spark for\nefficient on-line positional cross-matching and ii) supplying a Python library\nsupporting commonly-used operations for astronomical data analysis. To support\nscalable cross-matching, we developed a variant of the ZONES algorithm (Gray et\nal. 2004) capable of operating in distributed, shared-nothing architecture. We\ncouple this to a data partitioning scheme that enables fast catalog\ncross-matching and handles the data skew often present in deep all-sky data\nsets.

In our current work we try to understand the\nlate time acceleration of the universe by modifying the geometry of the space\nand using dynamical system analysis. The use of this technique allows to\nunderstand the behavior of the universe under several circumstances. Apart from\nthat we study the stability properties of the critical point and acceleration\nphase of the universe which could then be analyzed with observational data. We\nconsider a particular model $f(R) = R - \\mu R_{c}(R/R_{c})^{p}$ with $ 0 < p <\n1, \\mu, R_{c} > 0$ for the study. As a first case we consider the matter and\nradiation component of the universe with an assumption of no interaction\nbetween them. Later, as a second case we take matter, radiation and dark energy\n(cosmological constant) where study on effects of linear, non-linear and no\ninteraction between matter and dark energy is considered and results have been\ndiscussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 10:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

These bounds are\nfunctions of several norms of weights of the DNNs, such as the Frobenius and\nspectral norms, and they are computed for weights grouped according to either\ninput and output channels of the DNNs. In this work, we conjecture that if we\ncan impose multiple constraints on weights of DNNs to upper bound the norms of\nthe weights, and train the DNNs with these weights, then we can attain\nempirical generalization errors closer to the derived theoretical bounds, and\nimprove accuracy of the DNNs.\n  To this end, we pose two problems. First, we aim to obtain weights whose\ndifferent norms are all upper bounded by a constant number, e.g. 1.0. To\nachieve these bounds, we propose a two-stage renormalization procedure; (i)\nnormalization of weights according to different norms used in the bounds, and\n(ii) reparameterization of the normalized weights to set a constant and finite\nupper bound of their norms. In the second problem, we consider training DNNs\nwith these renormalized weights. To this end, we first propose a strategy to\nconstruct joint spaces (manifolds) of weights according to different\nconstraints in DNNs. Next, we propose a fine-grained SGD algorithm (FG-SGD) for\noptimization on the weight manifolds to train DNNs with assurance of\nconvergence to minima.

Once the problem is expressed as a finite set\nof constraints, the goal is to find the variables' values satisfying them. Even\nthough the problem is in general NP-complete, there are some approximation and\npractical techniques to tackle its intractability. One of the most widely used\ntechniques is the Constraint Propagation. It consists in explicitly excluding\nvalues or combination of values for some variables whenever they make a given\nsubset of constraints unsatisfied. In this paper, we deal with a CSP subclass\nwhich we call 4-CSP and whose constraint network infers relations of the form:\n$\\{ x \\sim \\alpha, x-y \\sim \\beta , (x-y) - (z-t) \\sim \\lambda \\}$, where $x,\ny, z$ and $t$ are real variables, $\\alpha , \\beta$ and $ \\lambda $ are real\nconstants and $ \\sim \\in \\{\\leq , \\geq \\} $.

Time and space complexities\nof the resolution algorithms are proved to be polynomial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 11:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

This obliquity significantly\nexceeds the ~1-2 degree distribution of inclinations among the planetary orbits\nand therefore requires a physical explanation. In concert, Sun-like stars are\nknown to spin down by an order of magnitude throughout their lifetimes. This\nspin-down is driven by the stellar wind, which carries angular momentum from\nthe star. If the mean angular momentum axis of the stellar wind deviates from\nthat of the stellar spin axis, it will lead to a component of the spin-down\ntorque that acts to tilt the star. Here, we show that Solar-like tilts of 6\ndegrees naturally arise during the first 10-100 Myr after planet formation as a\nresult of stellar winds that deviate by about 10 degrees from the star's spin\naxis. These results apply to the idealized case of a dipolar field, mildly\ninclined to the spin axis. Time-variability in the misalignment between the\nmagnetic and spin poles is modeled as stochastic fluctuations, autocorrelated\nover timescales comparable to the primordial spin-down time of several million\nyears. In addition to wind direction, time-variability in mass-loss rate and\nmagnetic topology over the stellar lifetime may alternatively generate\nobliquity. We hypothesize that the gaseous environments of young, open clusters\nmay provide forcing over sufficient timescales to tilt the astrospheres of\nyoung stars, exciting modest obliquities. The more extreme, retrograde stellar\nobliquities of extrasolar planetary systems likely arise through separate\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 12:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

They have been selected as one of the coding schemes\nfor the 5G communication systems due to their excellent error correction\nperformance when successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding with cyclic\nredundancy check (CRC) is used. A large list size is necessary for SCL decoding\nto achieve a low error rate. However, it impedes SCL decoding from achieving a\nhigh throughput as the computational complexity is very high when a large list\nsize is used.

The main goal is to\ndetermine the conditions that allow the throat of the wormhole to be threaded\nwith ordinary matter (by respecting the null energy condition) and that the\nsame conditions lead to a violation of the null energy condition in the fifth\ndimension, which can therefore be credited with helping to sustain the\nwormhole. The dependence of the metric coefficients on $l$ and time $t$ may\neither help or hinder the ability to use ordinary matter, while an unrestricted\ndependence on the fifth dimension could lead to a curvature singularity at the\nthroat.

However, in closed acoustic microcavities with viscous dissipation,\ntwo overlapping resonances may be excited at the same frequency as a double\nmode. In contrast to single modes, the double modes can support a steady\nrotating acoustic energy flux density and thus a corresponding rotating\nbulk-driven acoustic streaming. We derive analytical solutions for the double\nmodes in a rectangular box-shaped cavity including the viscous boundary layers,\nand use them to map out possible rotating patterns of bulk-driven acoustic\nstreaming. Remarkably, the rotating bulk-driven streaming may be excited by a\nnon-rotating actuation, and we determine the optimal geometry that maximizes\nthis excitation.

Coherent detection and\nmanipulation of such states in scalable devices are, therefore, essential in\nthese applications. Recent detection proposals include semiconductor quantum\ndots (QDs) coupled to the end of these wires, as changes in the QD electronic\nspectral density due to the MZM coupling could be detected in transport\nexperiments. Here, we propose that multi-QD systems can also be used to\nmanipulate MZMs through precise control over the QDs' parameters. The simplest\ncase where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot (DQD)\ngeometry. By using exact analytical methods and numerical renormalization-group\ncalculations, we show that the QDs' spectral functions can be used to\ncharacterize the presence or not of MZMs \"leaking\" into the DQD. More\nimportantly, we find that these signatures respond to changes in the DQD\nparameters such as gate-voltages and couplings in a consistent fashion.\nAdditionally, we show that different MZM-DQD coupling geometries (\"symmetric\" ,\n\"in-series\" and \"T-shaped\" junctions) offer distinct ways in which MZMs can be\nswitched from dot to dot. These results highlight the interesting possibilities\nthat DQDs offer for all-electrical MZM control in scalable devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 13:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

By\ncontrast, the downfield spectrum, which contains many potentially useful\nresonances, is typically not targeted because conventional water-suppressed\ntechniques indirectly saturate the labile protons through exchange.\nRelaxation-enhanced MRS (RE-MRS) uses frequency-selective excitation while\nactively avoiding bulk water perturbation, thereby enabling high-quality\ndownfield spectroscopy. However, RE-MRS typically requires very long (typically\n>40 ms) echo times (TEs) due to its localization module, which inevitably\ndecreases sensitivity and filters shorter T2 components. Here, we overcome this\nlimitation by combining RE-MRS and image selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS)\nlocalization, abbreviated iRE-MRS, which in turn allows very short TEs (5 ms\nusing our hardware).\n  Methods: Experiments were performed in vitro for validation as well as and in\nin vivo rat brains at 9.4T.\n  Results: The new iRE-MRS methodology was validated in phantoms where good\nperformance was noted. When the downfield spectrum was investigated at short\nTEs in in vivo rat brains, iRE-MRS provided very high sensitivity; the ensuing\ndownfield spectra encompassed numerous broad peaks, as well as a broad\nbaseline. All downfield spectral peaks were highly attenuated by increasing TEs\nas well as by applying water saturation, although to different extent. The\nsignal ratios also varied between TEs, suggesting that exchange rates are\ndifferent among the downfield signals.\n  Conclusions: Short-TE iRE 1H downfield MRS opens new directions in the\ninvestigation of in vivo downfield metabolites and their role on healthy and\ndisease processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 14:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

The characteristic size of this evacuated region depends\nstrongly on the spin-down evolution of the pulsar companion, which in turn\ndepends on the merging timescale of the system. If this evacuated region is\nable to grow to a sufficiently large scale, then the deceleration of the jet,\nand thus the onset of the afterglow, would be noticeably delayed. The first\ndetection of afterglow emission, which was uncovered 9.2 days after the\n$\\gamma$-ray burst trigger, can thus be used to constrain the size of a\npre-existing pulsar-wind cavity.

On the other hand, in\nthe graphical representation they are typically presented as decisions,\nintrinsically capable of directing control flow yet mostly oblivious to Boolean\ncombination. While categorical treatments of flowchart languages are abundant,\nnone of them provide a treatment of this dual nature of predicates. In the\npresent paper, we argue that extensive restriction categories are precisely\ncategories that capture such a condition/decision duality, by means of\nmorphisms which, coincidentally, are also called decisions.

Full classical propositional logic can be\nrecovered by restricting to total decisions, yielding extensive categories in\nthe usual sense, and confirming (from a different direction) a result from\neffectus theory that predicates on objects in extensive categories form Boolean\nalgebras. As an application, since (categorical) decisions are partial\nisomorphisms, this approach provides naturally reversible models of classical\npropositional logic and weak Kleene logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 15:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

To provide a better theoretical understanding of the reasons for its\nsuccess, we discuss the performance of deep learning and other methods on a\nnonparametric regression problem with a Gaussian noise. Whereas existing\ntheoretical studies of deep learning have been based mainly on mathematical\ntheories of well-known function classes such as H\\\"{o}lder and Besov classes,\nwe focus on function classes with discontinuity and sparsity, which are those\nnaturally assumed in practice. To highlight the effectiveness of deep learning,\nwe compare deep learning with a class of linear estimators representative of a\nclass of shallow estimators. It is shown that the minimax risk of a linear\nestimator on the convex hull of a target function class does not differ from\nthat of the original target function class. This results in the suboptimality\nof linear methods over a simple but non-convex function class, on which deep\nlearning can attain nearly the minimax-optimal rate. In addition to this\nextreme case, we consider function classes with sparse wavelet coefficients. On\nthese function classes, deep learning also attains the minimax rate up to log\nfactors of the sample size, and linear methods are still suboptimal if the\nassumed sparsity is strong. We also point out that the parameter sharing of\ndeep neural networks can remarkably reduce the complexity of the model in our\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 15:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 14:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Precise placement of needles is a challenge in a number of clinical\napplications such as brachytherapy or biopsy. Forces acting at the needle cause\ntissue deformation and needle deflection which in turn may lead to misplacement\nor injury. Hence, a number of approaches to estimate the forces at the needle\nhave been proposed. Yet, integrating sensors into the needle tip is challenging\nand a careful calibration is required to obtain good force estimates.\n  Methods. We describe a fiber-optical needle tip force sensor design using a\nsingle OCT fiber for measurement. The fiber images the deformation of an epoxy\nlayer placed below the needle tip which results in a stream of 1D depth\nprofiles. We study different deep learning approaches to facilitate calibration\nbetween this spatio-temporal image data and the related forces. In particular,\nwe propose a novel convGRU-CNN architecture for simultaneous spatial and\ntemporal data processing.\n  Results. The needle can be adapted to different operating ranges by changing\nthe stiffness of the epoxy layer. Likewise, calibration can be adapted by\ntraining the deep learning models. Our novel convGRU-CNN architecture results\nin the lowest mean absolute error of 1.59 +- 1.3 mN and a cross-correlation\ncoefficient of 0.9997, and clearly outperforms the other methods. Ex vivo\nexperiments in human prostate tissue demonstrate the needle's application.\n  Conclusions. Our OCT-based fiber-optical sensor presents a viable alternative\nfor needle tip force estimation. The results indicate that the rich\nspatio-temporal information included in the stream of images showing the\ndeformation throughout the epoxy layer can be effectively used by deep learning\nmodels. Particularly, we demonstrate that the convGRU-CNN architecture performs\nfavorably, making it a promising approach for other spatio-temporal learning\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 15:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

In particular, a new\narchitecture, DenseU-Hierarchical VAE (DUHiV), is designed to learn\nrepresentations from large-sized PGPMs, which achieves a significantly tighter\nevidence lower bound (ELBO) than existing Hierarchical VAEs with a Multilayer\nPerceptron architecture. Our approach supports modulating the derived\nrepresentations in an interactive visual interface, discover potential insights\nand create multi-label annotations. Evaluations using real-world PGPMs datasets\nshow that our framework outperforms the baseline models in identifying and\nannotating insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 05:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) decouples the\nnetwork functions from the underlying hardware. In NFV settings, application\ncomponents can be implemented as sets of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)\nchained in specific order representing VNF-Forwarding Graphs (VNF-FG). Many\nstudies have been carried out to map the VNF-FGs to cloud systems. However, in\nhybrid cloud/fog systems, an additional challenge arises. The mobility of fog\nnodes may cause high latency as the distance between the end-users and the\nnodes hosting the components increases. This may not be tolerable for some\napplications. In such cases, a prominent solution is to migrate application\ncomponents to a closer fog node. This paper focuses on application component\nmigration in NFV-based hybrid cloud/fog systems. The objective is to minimize\nthe aggregated makespan of the applications. The problem is modeled\nmathematically, and a heuristic is proposed to find the sub-optimal solution in\nan acceptable time. The heuristic aims at finding the optimal fog node in each\ntime-slot considering a pre-knowledge of the mobility models of the fog nodes.\nThe experiment's results show that our proposed solution improves the makespan\nand the number of migrations compared to random migration and No-migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 18:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

With longitudinally\ncollected biomarker data, it is of interest to dynamically update the predicted\nCIF by incorporating the most recent biomarker as well as the cumulating\nlongitudinal history. Motivated by a longitudinal cohort study of chronic\nkidney disease, we propose a framework for dynamic prediction of end stage\nrenal disease using multivariate longitudinal biomarkers, accounting for the\ncompeting risk of death. The proposed framework extends the landmark survival\nmodeling to competing risks data, and implies that a distinct sub-distribution\nhazard regression model is defined at each landmark time. The model parameters,\nprediction horizon, longitudinal history and at-risk population are allowed to\nvary over the landmark time. When the measurement times of biomarkers are\nirregularly spaced, the predictor variable may not be observed at the time of\nprediction. Local polynomial is used to estimate the model parameters without\nexplicitly imputing the predictor or modeling its longitudinal trajectory. The\nproposed model leads to simple interpretation of the regression coefficients\nand closed-form calculation of the predicted CIF. The estimation and prediction\ncan be implemented through standard statistical software with tractable\ncomputation. We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of the\nestimation procedure and predictive accuracy.
