This interface enables\nrelatively short passwords to have a higher calculated level of security due to\nthe need for an attacker to determine both the text of the password and the\nlocation of each character in the grid. We created a SPARTAN prototype and\nconducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the actual usability and\nsecurity of the SPARTAN interface compared to the linear password entry\ninterface.

Using\nsimilar techniques, we generalise Hayden-Preskill to show how the amount of\nHawking radiation required to reconstruct a large diary, thrown into the black\nhole, depends on both the energy and the entropy of the diary. Finally we argue\nthat, before the evaporation begins, a single, state-independent interior\nreconstruction exists for any code space of microstates with entropy strictly\nless than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and show that this is sufficient\nstate dependence to avoid the AMPSS typical-state firewall paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 20:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 01:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Numerical efforts to verify this\nidea have largely utilized the so-called locally isothermal approximation with\na prescribed disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary disks this\napproximation does not provide an accurate description of the density wave\ndynamics on scales of tens of au. Moreover, we show that locally isothermal\nsimulations tend to overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features, as well\nas misrepresent their positions, when compared to simulations in which the\nenergy equation is evolved explicitly.

I show that the thermal\nnature of the Rindler horizon is indeed contained --- though hidden --- in the\nstandard, inertial, Feynman propagator. The probability $P(E)$ for a particle\nto propagate between two events, with energy $E$, can be related to the\ntemporal Fourier transform of the propagator.

The solar chromosphere and the lower transition region is believed\nto play a crucial role in the heating of the solar corona. Models that describe\nthe chromosphere (and the lower transition region), accounting for its highly\ndynamic and structured character are, so far, found to be lacking. This is\npartly due to the breakdown of complete frequency redistribution in the\nchromospheric layers and also because of the difficulty in obtaining complete\nsets of observations that adequately constrain the solar atmosphere at all\nrelevant heights. Aims. We aim to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres that\nreproduce the features of the Mg II h&k line profiles that sample the middle\nchromosphere with focus on a sunspot. Methods. We use spectropolarimetric\nobservations of the Ca II 8542 A spectra obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar\nTelescope (SST) and use NICOLE inversions to obtain semi-empirical model\natmospheres for different features in and around a sunspot. These are used to\nsynthesize Mg II h&k spectra using RH1.5D code, which we compare with\nobservations taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).\nResults. Comparison of the synthetic profiles with IRIS observations reveals\nthat there are several areas, especially in the penumbra of the sunspot, where\nmost of the observed Mg II h&k profiles are very well reproduced. In addition,\nwe find that supersonic hot downflows, present in our collection of models in\nthe umbra, lead to synthetic profiles that agree well with the IRIS Mg II h&k\nprofiles, with the exception of the line core. Conclusions. We put forward and\nmake available four semi-empirical model atmospheres.

Initially predicted for spin, the orbital counterpart of this effect\nhas been disregarded up to now.

The inferred\nconditions within the emitting zone are at odds with theoretical expectations\nunless one assumes moderate (with $\\tau \\simeq 2$) absorption of sub-TeV\nphotons inside the source. With this correction the conditions are in good\nagreement with predictions of the pair-balance model, but are also acceptable\nfor generic afterglow model as one of many possibilities. However, the temporal\nevolution of the Inverse Compton peak energyis very different in these two\nmodels. This opens a way to discriminate between the models once late-time\ndetection in the TeV range become available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 18:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 14:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Hence, the spatial representation of the channel is\nessential. Further, for accurate beam alignment and minimizing the outages,\ninter-beam interferences, etc., cluster-level spatial modeling is also\nnecessary. Since, statistical channel models fail to reproduce the\nintra-cluster parameters due to the site-specific nature of the mmWave channel,\nin this paper, we propose a ray tracing intra-cluster model (RT-ICM) for mmWave\nchannels. The model considers only the first-order reflection; thereby reducing\nthe computation load while capturing most of the energy in a large number of\nimportant cases. The model accounts for diffuse scattering as it contributes\nsignificantly to the received power. Finally, since the clusters are spatially\nwell-separated due to the sparsity of first-order reflectors, we generalize the\nintra-cluster model to the mmWave channel model via replication. Since narrow\nbeamwidth increases the number of single-order clusters, we show that the\nproposed model suits well to MIMO and massive MIMO applications. We illustrate\nthat the model gives matching results with published measurements made in a\nclassroom at 60 GHz. For this specific implementation, while the maximum\ncluster angle of arrival (AoA) error is 1 degree, mean angle spread error is 9\ndegrees.

In order to widen our knowledge of the magnetic\nevolution of the Sun and solar-like stars, magnetic activity of the young solar\nanalogue V1358 Ori is investigated.

The PCA on the\ndata identifies key parameters, principal components (PCs), on which joint\nscalar PDFs and conditional scalar means can be constructed.

The problem of decompilation is extremely important for security\nresearchers.

Such decompilers have been designed by\nexperts to detect specific control-flow structures and idioms in low-level code\nand lift them to source level. The cost of supporting additional languages or\nnew language features in these models is very high.\n  We present a novel approach to decompilation based on neural machine\ntranslation. The main idea is to automatically learn a decompiler from a given\ncompiler. Given a compiler from a source language S to a target language T ,\nour approach automatically trains a decompiler that can translate (decompile) T\nback to S . We used our framework to decompile both LLVM IR and x86 assembly to\nC code with high success rates.

Methodology to address covariate measurement error has been\nwell developed; however, time-to-event error has also been shown to cause\nsignificant bias but methods to address it are relatively underdeveloped. More\ngenerally, it is possible to observe errors in both the covariate and the\ntime-to-event outcome that are correlated.

This paper shows for the first time in detail\nthat the LRU states of caches can be used to leak information: any access to a\ncache by a sender will modify the LRU state, and the receiver is able to\nobserve this through a timing measurement. This paper presents LRU timing-based\nchannels both when the sender and the receiver have shared memory, e.g., shared\nlibrary data pages, and when they are separate processes without shared memory.\nIn addition, the new LRU timing-based channels are demonstrated on both Intel\nand AMD processors in scenarios where the sender and the receiver are sharing\nthe cache in both hyper-threaded setting and time-sliced setting. The\ntransmission rate of the LRU channels can be up to 600Kbps per cache set in the\nhyper-threaded setting. Different from the majority of existing cache channels\nwhich require the sender to trigger cache misses, the new LRU channels work\nwith the sender only having cache hits, making the channel faster and more\nstealthy.

Although there is microstructural\nevidence elucidating the nature of brittle deformation at low pressures, there\nis often conflicting evidence regarding the potential for plastic deformation\nin the ductile regime at higher pressures. Here, we present a series of\nspherical nanoindentation experiments on aggregates of natural antigorite.\nThese experiments effectively investigate the single-crystal mechanical\nbehavior because the volume of deformed material is significantly smaller than\nthe grain size. Individual indents reveal elastic loading followed by yield and\nstrain hardening. The magnitude of the yield stress is a function of crystal\norientation, with lower values associated with indents parallel to the basal\nplane. Unloading paths reveal more strain recovery than expected for purely\nelastic unloading. The magnitude of inelastic strain recovery is highest for\nindents parallel to the basal plane. We also imposed indents with cyclical\nloading paths, and observed strain energy dissipation during unloading-loading\ncycles conducted up to a fixed maximum indentation load and depth. The\nmagnitude of this dissipated strain energy was highest for indents parallel to\nthe basal plane. Subsequent scanning electron microscopy revealed surface\nimpressions accommodated by shear cracks and a general lack of lattice\nmisorientation around indents, indicating the absence of dislocations. Based on\nthese observations, we suggest that antigorite deformation at high pressures is\ndominated by sliding on shear cracks. We develop a microphysical model that is\nable to quantitatively explain the Young's modulus and dissipated strain energy\ndata during cyclic loading experiments, based on either frictional or cohesive\nsliding of an array of cracks contained in the basal plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 22:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 13:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

We then argue that as a discipline, we can\nand should break open our black-box methods by mimicking the five steps that\nmolecular biologists commonly use to break open Nature's black boxes: design a\nsimple model system, formulate hypotheses using that system, test them in\nexperiments on that system, iterate as needed to reformulate and test\nhypotheses, and finally test the results in an \"in vivo\" system. We demonstrate\nthis by identifying conditions under which the random-regressions restricted\nlikelihood is likely to be maximized at a boundary value. Resistance to this\napproach seems to arise from a view that it lacks the certainty or intellectual\nheft of mathematics, perhaps because simulation experiments in our literature\nrarely do more than measure a new method's operating characteristics in a small\nrange of situations. We argue that such work can make useful contributions\nincluding, as in molecular biology, the findings themselves and sometimes the\ndesigns used in the five steps; that these contributions have as much practical\nvalue as mathematical results; and that therefore they merit publication as\nmuch as the mathematical results our discipline esteems so highly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 23:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Existing and emerging technologies have enabled measurement\nof chemical properties of molecules in complex mixtures and, in concert, are\nsensitive enough to resolve even stereoisomers. Despite these experimental\nadvances, small molecule identification is inhibited by (i) chemical reference\nlibraries representing <1% of known molecules, limiting the number of possible\nidentifications, and (ii) the lack of a method to generate candidate matches\ndirectly from experimental features (i.e. without a library). To this end, we\ndeveloped a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a continuous numerical, or\nlatent, representation of molecular structure to expand reference libraries for\nsmall molecule identification. We extended the VAE to include a chemical\nproperty decoder, trained as a multitask network, in order to shape the latent\nrepresentation such that it assembles according to desired chemical properties.\nThe approach is unique in its application to small molecule identification,\nwith its focus on m/z and CCS, paired with its training paradigm, which\ninvolved a cascade of transfer learning iterations.

Our experiments are targeted toward application developers so that they\ncan make informed decisions on choosing the container technologies and\napproaches that are suitable for their HPC workloads on cloud infrastructure.\nOur performance analysis shows that scientific workloads for both Docker and\nSingularity based containers can achieve near-native performance. Singularity\nis designed specifically for HPC workloads. However, Docker still has\nadvantages over Singularity for use in clouds as it provides overlay networking\nand an intuitive way to run MPI applications with one container per rank for\nfine-grained resources allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 03:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

Next, post-processing was carried out by using\nthe concave-convex iterative repair algorithm and the decision mechanism of\ncandidate mask sets.

Packets have a hard\ndeadline of one time slot. The slot is divided into two phases. Out of those\nusers having high channel gain allowing them to decode the packet in the first\nphase, one is chosen to rebroadcast it to the remaining users in the second\nphase.

To overcome this drawback, we propose a more discriminative graph\nlearning method which can preserve the pairwise similarities between samples in\nan adaptive manner for the first time.

Moreover, the structure is adaptively tuned so that the number of\nconnected components of the graph is exactly equal to the number of clusters.\nFinally, our method unifies clustering and graph learning which can directly\nobtain cluster indicators from the graph itself without performing further\nclustering step.

The dynamics of such active\nfilaments can, under favorable conditions, exhibit stable time-periodic\nresponses that result due to the interplay of elastic buckling instabilities,\ngeometric constraints, boundary conditions, and dissipation due to fluid drag.\nIn this paper, we use a continuum elastic rod model to estimate the critical\nfollower force required for the onset of the stable time-periodic flapping\noscillations in pre-stressed rods subjected to fluid drag. The pre-stress is\ngenerated by imposing either clamped-clamped or clamped-pinned boundary\nconstraints and the results are compared with those of clamped-free case, which\nis without pre-stress. We find that the critical value increases with the\ninitial slack--that quantifies the pre-stress, and strongly depends on the type\nof the constraints at the boundaries. The frequency of oscillations far from\nthe onset, however, depends primarily on the magnitude of the follower force,\nnot on the boundary constraints. Interestingly, oscillations for the\nclamped-pinned case are observed only when the follower forces are directed\ntowards the clamped end. This finding can be exploited to design a mechanical\nswitch to initiate or quench the oscillations by reversing the direction of the\nfollower force or altering the boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 03:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

One critical step in the\nmultilevel/multigrid methods is to form coarse matrices through a sequence of\nsparse matrix triple products. A commonly used approach for the triple products\nexplicitly involves two steps, and during each step a sparse matrix-matrix\nmultiplication is employed. This approach works well for many applications with\na good computational efficiency, but it has a high memory overhead since some\nauxiliary matrices need to be temporarily stored for accomplishing the\ncalculations.

An aspect of the\nfundamental difficulties lies in the fact that such nonmagnetic disorders lead\neffective interactions between abundant soft modes near the Fermi surface to be\ndrastically enhanced particularly in the diffusive regime, where the\nperturbative framework does not work. Here, we revisit the problem of dirty\nquantum critical metals in a different angle, focusing on the hydrodynamic\nregime instead of the diffusive regime near the non-Fermi liquid quantum\ncritical point. More concretely, we study effects of mutual correlations\nbetween quantum critical nematic fluctuations and weak localization\ncorrections, and show the existence of a weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid fixed\npoint, based on the renormalization group (RG) analysis up to the two-loop\norder. The two-loop order RG analysis suggests that the absence of quantum\ncoherence in two-particle composite excitations weakens the role of weak\nlocalization corrections and allows a weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid\nmetallic state in the hydrodynamic regime of the nematic quantum critical\npoint. Although this dirty non-Fermi liquid metallic state may not be the true\ninfrared stable fixed point at zero temperature, expected to be characterized\nby the diffusive Ohmic regime, we argue that this weak-disorder non-Fermi\nliquid metallic fixed point would govern the region of an intermediate energy\nscale, described by effective hydrodynamics of nematic quantum criticality. In\nthis respect we believe that this research would be an important step in\nunderstanding the $T-$linear electrical resistivity as a characteristic feature\nof non-Fermi liquids and the origin of unconventional superconductivity from\neffective hydrodynamics of quantum criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 05:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 06:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 09:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Second, it is\nwell-recognized that landscapes are hierarchical such that fine-scale regions\nare nested wholly within broader-scale regions. To address these two\nchallenges, first, we develop a spatially constrained spectral clustering\nframework for region delineation that incorporates the tradeoff between region\nhomogeneity and spatial contiguity. The framework uses a flexible, truncated\nexponential kernel to represent the spatial contiguity constraints, which is\nintegrated with the landscape feature similarity matrix for region delineation.\nTo address the second challenge, we extend the framework to create fine-scale\nregions that are nested within broader-scaled regions using a greedy, recursive\nbisection approach. We present a case study of a terrestrial ecology data set\nin the United States that compares the proposed framework with several baseline\nmethods for regionalization.

The solar wind\nvelocity distribution is represented using $\\kappa$-functions, which are\ntransformed in response to simulated shock transitions in the fixed-frame flow\nspeed, plasma number density, and temperature. These heated solar wind\ndistributions are specified as source spectra at the shock from which particles\nwith sufficient energy can be injected into the diffusive shock acceleration\nprocess. It is shown that for shock-accelerated spectra to display the\nclassically expected power-law indices associated with the compression ratio,\ndiffusion length scales must exceed the width of the compression region. The\nmaximum attainable energies of shock-accelerated spectra are found to be\nlimited by the transit times of interplanetary shocks, while spectra may be\naccelerated to higher energies in the presence of higher levels of magnetic\nturbulence or at faster-moving shocks. Indeed, simulations suggest fast-moving\nshocks are more likely to produce very high-energy particles, while strong\nshocks, associated with harder shock-accelerated spectra, are linked to higher\nintensities of energetic particles. The prior heating of the solar wind\ndistribution is found to complement shock acceleration in reproducing the\nintensities of typical energetic storm particle events, especially where\ninjection energies are high. Moreover, simulations of $\\sim$0.2 to 1 MeV proton\nintensities are presented that naturally reproduce the observed flat energy\nspectra prior to shock passages. Energetic particles accelerated from the solar\nwind, aided by its prior heating, are shown to contribute substantially to\nintensities during energetic storm particle events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 06:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

To generate more\nnatural speech signals, we exploited a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) acoustic\nmodel with an attention-based generative network (e.g., Tacotron 2) to estimate\nthe condition parameters of the ExcitNet vocoder. Because the seq2seq acoustic\nmodel accurately estimates spectral parameters, and because the ExcitNet model\neffectively generates the corresponding time-domain excitation signals,\ncombining these two models can synthesize natural speech signals. Furthermore,\nwe verified the merit of the proposed method in producing expressive speech\nsegments by adopting a global style token-based emotion embedding method. The\nexperimental results confirmed that the proposed system significantly\noutperforms the systems with a similarly configured conventional WaveNet\nvocoder and our best prior parametric TTS counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 08:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Abundant numerical tests including hypersonic flow, turbulence, and\naeroacoustic problems, have been used to validate its accuracy, efficiency, and\nrobustness. However, there are still rooms for its further improvement.\nFirstly, the reconstruction in the previous scheme mainly achieves a\nthird-order accuracy for the initial non-equilibrium states. At the same time,\nthe equilibrium state in space and time in HGKS has to be reconstructed\nseparately. Secondly, it is complicated to get reconstructed data at Gaussian\npoints from the WENO-type method in high dimensions. For HGKS, besides the\npoint-wise values at the Gaussian points it also requires the slopes in both\nnormal and tangential directions of a cell interface. Thirdly, there exists\nvisible spurious overshoot/undershoot at weak discontinuities from the previous\nHGKS with the standard WENO reconstruction. In order to overcome these\ndifficulties, in this paper we use an improved reconstruction for HGKS. The\nWENO with adaptive order (WENO-AO) method is implemented for reconstruction.A\nwhole polynomial inside each cell is provided in WENO-AO reconstruction. The\nHGKS becomes simpler than the previous one with the direct implementation of\ncell interface values and their slopes from WENO-AO. The additional\nreconstruction of equilibrium state at the beginning of each time step can be\navoided as well by dynamically merging the reconstructed non-equilibrium\nslopes. The new HGKS essentially releases or totally removes the above existing\nproblems in previous HGKS. The accuracy of the scheme from 1D to 3D from the\nnew HGKS can recover the theoretical order of accuracy of the WENO\nreconstruction.In the two- and three-dimensional simulations, the new HGKS\nshows better robustness and efficiency than the previous scheme in all test\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 08:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

To construct such a\nmodel from a given set of assignment examples concerning reference\nalternatives, we develop a convex quadratic programming model.

However, the dynamic nature, which generates the\nevolution of human contact networks, of contact patterns is not known yet.\nHere, we analyse three empirical datasets and identify two crucial mechanisms\nof the evolution of temporal human contact networks, i.e. the activity state\ntransition laws for an individual to be socially active, and the contact\nestablishment mechanism that active individuals adopt. We consider both of the\ntwo mechanisms to propose a temporal network model, named the memory driven\n(MD) model, of human contact networks. Then we study the susceptible-infected\n(SI) spreading processes on empirical human contact networks and four\ncorresponding temporal network models, and compare the full prevalence time of\nSI processes with various infection rates on the networks. The full prevalence\ntime of SI processes in the MD model is the same as that in real-world human\ncontact networks. Moreover, we find that the individual activity state\ntransition promotes the spreading process, while, the contact establishment of\nactive individuals suppress the prevalence. Apart from this, we observe that\neven a small percentage of individuals to explore new social ties is able to\ninduce an explosive spreading on networks.

For concerns of\nsafety, economy, and convenience, it is important that such systems work\ncorrectly. However, it is a notoriously difficult task to ensure that the\nsoftware running on computers behaves correctly.\n  One approach to ease this task is that of model checking, where a model of\nthe system is made using some mathematical formalism. Requirements expressed in\na formal language can then be verified against the model in order to give\nguarantees that the model satisfies the requirements.\n  For many computer systems, time is an important factor. As such, we need our\nformalisms and requirement languages to be able to incorporate real time.\n  We therefore develop formalisms and algorithms that allow us to compare and\nexpress properties about real-time systems. We first introduce a logical\nformalism for reasoning about upper and lower bounds on time, and study the\nproperties of this formalism, including axiomatisation and algorithms for\nchecking when a formula is satisfied.\n  We then consider the question of when a system is faster than another system.\nWe show that this is a difficult question which can not be answered in general,\nbut we identify special cases where this question can be answered. We also show\nthat under this notion of faster-than, a local increase in speed may lead to a\nglobal decrease in speed, and we take step towards avoiding this.\n  Finally, we consider how to compare the real-time behaviour of systems not\njust qualitatively, but also quantitatively. Thus, we are interested in knowing\nhow much one system is faster or slower than another system. This is done by\nintroducing a distance between systems. We show how to compute this distance\nand that it behaves well with respect to certain properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 10:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

One way to implement CSPNs is to use an existing SPN\nstructure and condition its parameters on the input, e.g., via a deep neural\nnetwork.

In recent years, there has been\nmuch effort to understand the process of thermalization in strongly interacting\nquantum systems that often lack an obvious semiclassical limit. Time-dependent\nvariational principle (TDVP) allows to systematically derive an effective\nclassical (nonlinear) dynamical system by projecting unitary many-body dynamics\nonto a manifold of weakly-entangled variational states. We demonstrate that\nsuch dynamical systems generally possess mixed phase space. When TDVP errors\nare small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of\nthe quantum model. For example, when the system is initialized in a state\nbelonging to a stable periodic orbit or the surrounding regular region, it\nexhibits persistent many-body quantum revivals. As a proof of principle, we\nidentify new types of \"quantum many-body scars\", i.e., initial states that lead\nto long-time oscillations in a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in one and\ntwo dimensions. Intriguingly, the initial states that give rise to most robust\nrevivals are typically entangled states. On the other hand, even when TDVP\nerrors are large, as in the thermalizing tilted-field Ising model, initializing\nthe system in a regular region of phase space leads to slowdown of\nthermalization. Our work establishes TDVP as a method for identifying\ninteracting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics in arbitrary dimensions.\nMoreover, the mixed-phase space classical variational equations allow to find\nslowly-thermalizing initial conditions in interacting models. Our results shed\nlight on a link between classical and quantum chaos, pointing towards possible\nextensions of classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem to quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 11:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 20:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

Ridge regression and least absolute\nshrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) can be used for implementation of L2-\nand L1-norm penalties in MCR, respectively. The main question is which Lx-norm\npenalty is more worthwhile for implementation of the sparsity constraint in MCR\nmethods. In order to address this question, two and three component LC-MS data\nwere simulated and used for the case study in this work. The areas of feasible\nsolutions (AFS) were calculated using the grid search strategy. Calculating\nLx-norms values in AFS for x between zero and two revealed that the gradient of\noptimization surface increased from x values equal to two to x values near\nzero. However, for x equal to zero, the optimization surface was similar to a\nplateau, which increased the risk of sticking in local minima. Generally,\nresults in this work, recommend the use of L1-norm penalty methods like Lasso\nfor implementation of sparsity constraint in MCR-ALS algorithm for finding more\nsparse solutions and reducing the extent of rotational ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 12:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The local discontinuous polynomial trial and test functions are\npostulated by using the Generalized Finite Difference method. These functions\nare only piece-wise continuous over the global domain. By implementing the\nPoint-based trial and test functions into the Galerkin weak form, we define the\nconcept of Point Stiffnesses as the contribution of each Point in the problem\ndomain to the global stiffness matrix. However, due to the discontinuity of\ntrial and test functions in the domain, directly using the Galerkin weak form\nleads to inconsistency. To resolve this, Numerical Flux Corrections, which are\nfrequently used in Discontinuous Galerkin methods are further employed in the\nFPM. The resulting global stiffness matrix is symmetric and sparse, which is\nadvantageous for large-scale engineering computations.

We highlight three use cases where BrainPainter was\nused in existing neuroimaging studies: (1) visualisation of the degree of\natrophy through interpolation along a user-defined gradient of colours, (2)\nvisualisation of the progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease as well as\n(3) visualisation of pathology in subcortical regions in Huntington's disease.\nMoreover, through the design of BrainPainter we demonstrate the possibility of\nusing a powerful 3D computer graphics engine such as Blender to generate brain\nvisualisations for the neuroscience community. Blender's capabilities, e.g.\nparticle simulations, motion graphics, UV unwrapping, raster graphics editing,\nraytracing and illumination effects, open a wealth of possibilities for brain\nvisualisation not available in current neuroimaging software. BrainPainter is\ncustomisable, easy to use, and can run straight from the web browser:\nhttps://brainpainter.csail.mit.edu , as well as from source-code packaged in a\ndocker container: https://github.com/mrazvan22/brain-coloring .

It is assumed that they formed further out and migrated to their observed\nposition. We extend previous studies to a more realistic thermal disc structure\nand determine what parameter influence the final parking location of a planet\naround a binary star. We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of\nviscous accretion discs around a central binary that include viscous heating\nand radiative cooling from the disc surfaces. We vary the binary eccentricity\nas well as disc viscosity and mass. Concerning the disc evolution we find that\nit can take well over 100000 binary orbits until an equilibrium state is\nreached. As seen previously, we find that the central cavity opened by the\nbinary becomes eccentric and precesses slowly in a prograde sense. Embedded\nplanets migrate to the inner edge of the disc. In cases of lower disc viscosity\nthey migrate further in maintaining a circular orbit, while for high viscosity\nthey are parked further out on an eccentric orbit. The final location of an\nembedded planet is linked to its ability to open a gap in the disc. Gap opening\nplanets separate inner from outer disc, preventing eccentricity excitation in\nthe latter and making it more circular. This allows embedded planets to migrate\ncloser to the binary, in agreement with the observations. The necessary\ncondition for gap opening and the final planet position depend on the planet\nmass and disc viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 13:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

One of the most common\nrounding techniques in this context are contention resolution schemes. Such\nschemes round a fractional point by first rounding each coordinate\nindependently, and then dropping some elements to reach a feasible set. Also\nthe second step, where elements are dropped, is typically randomized. This\nleads to an additional source of randomization within the procedure, which can\ncomplicate the analysis. We suggest a different, polyhedral viewpoint to design\ncontention resolution schemes, which avoids to deal explicitly with the\nrandomization in the second step. This is achieved by focusing on the marginals\nof a dropping procedure. Apart from avoiding one source of randomization, our\nviewpoint allows for employing polyhedral techniques. Both can significantly\nsimplify the construction and analysis of contention resolution schemes. We\nshow how, through our framework, one can obtain an optimal monotone contention\nresolution scheme for bipartite matchings. So far, only very few results are\nknown about optimality of monotone contention resolution schemes. Our\ncontention resolution scheme for the bipartite case also improves the lower\nbound on the correlation gap for bipartite matchings. Furthermore, we derive a\nmonotone contention resolution scheme for matchings that significantly improves\nover the previously best one. At the same time, our scheme implies that the\ncurrently best lower bound on the correlation gap for matchings is not tight.\nOur results lead to improved approximation factors for various constrained\nsubmodular function maximization problems over a combination of matching\nconstraints with further constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 14:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Due\nto the nature of these models as well as the practical challenges which include\ntime-varying parameters, the transition from numerical/analytical modeling of\nmachining to the analysis of real cutting signals remains challenging. Some\nstudies have focused on studying the time series of cutting processes using\nmachine learning algorithms with the goal of identifying and predicting\nundesirable vibrations during machining referred to as chatter. These tools\ntypically decompose the signal using Wavelet Packet Transforms (WPT) or\nEnsemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, these methods require a\nsignificant overhead in identifying the feature vectors before a classifier can\nbe trained. In this study, we present an alternative approach based on\nfeaturizing the time series of the cutting process using its topological\nfeatures. We first embed the time series as a point cloud using Takens\nembedding. We then utilize Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random\nForest and Gradient Boosting classifier combined with feature vectors derived\nfrom persistence diagrams, a tool from persistent homology, to encode chatter's\ndistinguishing characteristics. We present the results for several choices of\nthe topological feature vectors, and we compare our results to the WPT and EEMD\nmethods using experimental turning data. Our results show that in two out of\nfour cutting configurations the TDA-based features yield accuracies as high as\n97%. We also show that combining Bezier curve approximation method and parallel\ncomputing can reduce runtime for persistence diagram computation of a single\ntime series to less than a second thus making our approach suitable for online\nchatter detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 14:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 20:15:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 21:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

However, in order to\ndevelop solar diagnosis, it is fundamental to understand the different kinds of\nanomalous solar signals that have been routinely found in linear and circular\npolarization (LP,CP). The goal of this paper has been to explain and\ncharacterize the morphology of solar CP signals by understanding the combined\neffect of magnetic fields, velocity gradients, and atomic orientation in\ngeneral NLTE regime. To that aim, an analytical two-layer model of the\npolarized radiative transfer equation is developed and used to solve the NLTE\nproblem with atomic polarization in a semi-parametric way. The formation of\npolarization is thus insightfully described with certain precision without\nresorting in MHD models or sacrifying key physical ingredients. The potential\nof the model for reproducing solar anomalous CP is shown with detailed\ncalculations. The essential physical behavior of dichroism and atomic\norientation is described, introducing the concepts of dichroic inversion,\nneutral and reinforcing medium, critic intensity spectrum, and critic source\nfunction. It is shown that the zero-crossings of the CP spectrum are useful to\nclassify its morphology and understand its formation. This led to identify and\nexplain the morphology of the seven most characteristics CP signals that a\nsingle (depth-resolved) scattering layer can produce. Futhermore, it is found\nthat a minimal number of two magnetic layers along the LOS is required to fully\nexplain anomalous solar CP signals, and that the morphology and polarity of\nStokes V depends on magnetic, radiative and atomic polarities. Some\nimplications of these results are presented through a preliminar modeling of\nanomalous CP signals in the Na I D and Fe I 1564.8 nm lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 14:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 21:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The composition inferred from\nthe experimental data, interpreted by using the current high energy hadronic\ninteraction models, seems to be light below the ankle, showing a trend to\nheavier nuclei for increasing values of the primary energy.

Carbon rich water from\nshelf-seas is exported at depth to the open ocean, a process known as the\ncontinental shelf pump, with open-ocean surface water moving (transported) onto\nthe shelf driving the export at depth. Existing methods to study shelf-wide\nexchange focus on the wind or geostrophic currents, often ignoring their\ncombined effect, spatial heterogeniety or any other ageostrophic components.\nHere we investigate the influence that wind, wave and current interactions can\nhave on surface transport and carbon export across continental shelves. Using a\n21 year global re-analysis dataset we confirm that geostrophic and wind driven\nEkman processes are important for the transport of water onto shelf seas; but\nthe dominance of each is location and season dependent. A global wave model\nre-analysis shows that one type of ageostrophic flow, Stokes drift due to\nwaves, can also be significant. A regional case study using two submesocale\nmodel simulations identifies that up to 100% of the cross-shelf surface flow in\nEuropean seas can be due to ageostrophic components. Using these results and\ngrouping shelf-seas based on their observed carbon accumulation rates shows\nthat differences in rates are consistent with imbalances between the processes\ndriving atmosphere-ocean exchange at the surface and those driving carbon\nexport at depth. Therefore expected future changes in wind and wave climate\nsupport the need to monitor cross-shelf transport and the size of the\ncontinental shelf-sea carbon pump.

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network for\npoint cloud, dubbed GAPNet, to learn local geometric representations by\nembedding graph attention mechanism within stacked Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP)\nlayers. Firstly, we introduce a GAPLayer to learn attention features for each\npoint by highlighting different attention weights on neighborhood. Secondly, in\norder to exploit sufficient features, a multi-head mechanism is employed to\nallow GAPLayer to aggregate different features from independent heads. Thirdly,\nwe propose an attention pooling layer over neighbors to capture local signature\naimed at enhancing network robustness. Finally, GAPNet applies stacked MLP\nlayers to attention features and local signature to fully extract local\ngeometric structures. The proposed GAPNet architecture is tested on the\nModelNet40 and ShapeNet part datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both shape classification and part segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 15:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Our minimal affine\nextension of the GR has geodesics coinciding with the pseudo Riemannian ones,\nup to parameterizations. It predicts a `sterile' massive vecton and depends on\ntwo new dimensional constants, which can be measured in the limit of small\nvecton velocity. In a special gauge, this velocity has an upper limit near\nwhich it grows to infinity. The linearized vecton theory is similar to the\nscalar models of inflation except the fact of internal anisotropy of the\nvecton. For this reason we study general solutions of scalar analogs of the\nvecton theory without restricting the curvature parameter and anisotropy by\nusing previously derived exact solutions as functions of the metric. It is\nshown that the effects of curvature and anisotropy fast decrease in expanding\nuniverses. Our approach can be applied to anisotropic universes, which is\ndemonstrated on an exactly solvable strongly anisotropic cosmology.

However, the energy use of buildings,\nespecially the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), is far from\nbeing efficient. There still exists a dramatic potential to save energy through\nimproving building energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper studies the control\nof HVAC system for multi-zone buildings with the objective to reduce energy\nconsumption cost while satisfying thermal comfort. In particular, the thermal\ncouplings due to the heat transfer between the adjacent zones are incorporated\nin the optimization. Considering that a centralized method is generally\ncomputationally prohibitive for large buildings, an efficient decentralized\napproach is developed, based on the Accelerated Distributed Augmented\nLagrangian (ADAL) method [1]. To evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmethod, we first compare it with a centralized method, in which the optimal\nsolution of a small-scale problem can be obtained. We find that this\ndecentralized approach can almost approach the optimal solution of the problem.\nFurther, this decentralized approach is compared with the Distributed\nToken-Based Scheduling Strategy (DTBSS) [2]. The numeric results reveal that\nwhen the number of zones is relatively small (less than 20), the two\ndecentralized methods can achieve a comparable performance regarding the cost\nof the HVAC system. However, with an increase of the number of zones in the\nbuilding, the proposed decentralized approach demonstrates better performance\nwith a considerable reduction of the total cost. Moreover, the decentralized\napproach proposed in this paper demonstrate better scalability with less\naverage computation required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 04:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

This study attempts to bridge the gap by quantitatively\nshowing how the transport mechanism varies with particle size from nano- to\nmicroscale. Using a three-dimensional (3D) multiscale method, the dispersion of\nparticles in microscale tubular flows is investigated for various hematocrits,\nvessel diameters and particle sizes. NPs exhibit a nonuniform,\nsmoothly-dispersed distribution across the tube radius due to severe Brownian\nmotion. The near-wall concentration of NPs can be moderately enhanced by\nincreasing hematocrit and confinement. Moreover, there exists a critical\nparticle size ($\\sim$1 $\\mu$m) that leads to excessive retention of particles\nin the cell-free region near the wall, i.e., margination. Above this threshold,\nthe margination propensity increases with the particle size. The dominance of\nRBC-enhanced shear-induced diffusivity (RESID) over Brownian diffusivity (BD)\nresults in 10 times higher radial diffusion rates in the RBC-laden region\ncompared to that in the cell-free layer, correlated with the high margination\npropensity of microscale particles.

In\nthis work we have studied the interaction between Pd and SiC. We have observed\nthat as Pd diffuses it can change the chemical composition and microstructure\nof SiC. Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) analysis showed that Pd\nincreased the amount of high angle grain boundaries from 47 to 59%.\nFurthermore, we have observed that as Pd diffused, it changed the composition\nof SiC by leaving a trail of excess carbon at the grain boundary.

This reduction affected the\nstability of graphene oxide in water by decreasing its zeta potential from 41\nto 37 mV with the increase of the exposure time. Our results showed that after\n24 h of UV exposure, As(III) adsorption capacity decreased from 5 mg/g to 4.7\nmg/g, however after 48 h of irradiation the adsorption increased with time,\nreaching 5.1 mg/g at 120 h under 74 uW/cm2 of irradiation.

Esports games generate massive amounts of telemetry data. Using\nthese to predict the outcome of esports matches has received considerable\nattention, but micro-predictions, which seek to predict events inside a match,\nis as yet unknown territory. Micro-predictions are however of perennial\ninterest across esports commentators and audience, because they provide the\nability to observe events that might otherwise be missed: esports games are\nhighly complex with fast-moving action where the balance of a game can change\nin the span of seconds, and where events can happen in multiple areas of the\nplaying field at the same time. Such events can happen rapidly, and it is easy\nfor commentators and viewers alike to miss an event and only observe the\nfollowing impact of events. In Dota 2, a player hero being killed by the\nopposing team is a key event of interest to commentators and audience. We\npresent a deep learning network with shared weights which provides accurate\ndeath predictions within a five-second window. The network is trained on a vast\nselection of Dota 2 gameplay features and professional/semi-professional level\nmatch dataset.
