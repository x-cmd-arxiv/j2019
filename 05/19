Some\nexamples include: sedimenting marine snow particles in lakes and oceans\n(central to carbon sequestration), dense microplastics in the oceans (which\nimpact ocean ecology and the food chain), and even iron snow on Mercury\n(conjectured as its magnetic field source). These fluid systems all have stable\ndensity stratification, which is known to trap particulates through upper\nlightweight fluid coating the sinking particles, thus providing transient\nbuoyancy. The current understanding of aggregation of such trapped matter\ninvolves collisions (due to Brownian motion, shear, and differential settling)\nand adhesion. Here, we observe and rationalize a new fundamental effective\nattractive mechanism by which particles suspended within stratification may\nself-assemble and form large aggregates without need for short range binding\neffects. This phenomenon arises through a complex interplay involving solute\ndiffusion, impermeable boundaries, and aggregate geometry, which produces\ntoroidal flows. We show that these toroidal flows yield attractive horizontal\nforces between particles. We observe that many particles demonstrate a\ncollective motion revealing a system which self-assembles, appearing to solve\njigsaw-like puzzles on its way to organizing into a disc-like shape, with the\neffective force increasing as the collective disc radius grows. Control\nexperiments with two objects isolate the individual dynamics, which are\nquantitatively predicted through numerical integration of the underlying\nequations of motion. This new mechanism may be an important process in\nformation of marine snow aggregates and distribution of phytoplankton in lakes\nand oceans. Further, it potentially provides a new mechanism for general\nsorting and packing of layered material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 16:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

The order $n$ best suited to describe\na given system can be found automatically within the Bayesian framework by\nmaximisation of the marginal likelihood. The procedure is first tested on a toy\nmodel of known interaction and later applied to two real materials described at\nthe DFT level of accuracy. The models automatically selected for the two\nmaterials were found to be in agreement with physical intuition. More in\ngeneral, it was found that lower order (simpler) models should be chosen when\nthe data are not sufficient to resolve more complex interactions. Low $n$ GPs\ncan be further sped up by orders of magnitude by constructing the corresponding\ntabulated force field, here named \"MFF\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 19:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In\nparticular, it is challenging to understand how the contribution of a\nparticular feature, or group of features, varies as their value changes. To\naddress this, we introduce Disentangled Attribution Curves (DAC), a method to\nprovide interpretations of tree ensemble methods in the form of (multivariate)\nfeature importance curves. For a given variable, or group of variables, DAC\nplots the importance of a variable(s) as their value changes. We validate DAC\non real data by showing that the curves can be used to increase the accuracy of\nlogistic regression while maintaining interpretability, by including DAC as an\nadditional feature. In simulation studies, DAC is shown to out-perform\ncompeting methods in the recovery of conditional expectations.

In\nsome cases, it can have a significant observable impact on stellar structure\nand evolution. The efficiency of mixing by fingering convection as a standalone\nprocess has been studied by Brown et al. (2013), but other processes such as\nrotation, magnetic fields and shear can affect it. In this paper, we present a\nfirst study of the effect of shear on fingering (thermohaline) convection in\nastrophysics. Using Direct Numerical Simulations we find that a moderate amount\nof shear (that is not intrinsically shear-unstable) always decreases the mixing\nefficiency of fingering convection, as a result of the tilt it imparts to the\nfingering structures. We propose a simple analytical extension of the Brown et\nal. (2013) model in the presence of shear that satisfactorily explains the\nnumerically-derived turbulent compositional mixing coefficient for moderate\nshearing rates, and can trivially be implemented in stellar evolution codes. We\nalso measure from the numerical simulations a turbulent viscosity, and find\nthat the latter is strongly tied to the turbulent compositional mixing\ncoefficient.

The transition from molecular hydrogen to metallic\nhydrogen as temperature and pressure increase is believed to be a smooth one.\nAs a result, the electrical conductivity in Jupiter varies continuously from\nbeing negligible at the surface to a large value in the deeper region. Thus,\nunlike the Earth where the upper boundary of the dynamo---the dynamo\nradius---is definitively located at the core-mantle boundary, it is not clear\nat what depth dynamo action becomes significant in Jupiter. In this paper,\nusing a numerical model of the Jovian dynamo, we examine the magnetic energy\nspectrum at different depth and identify a dynamo radius below which (and away\nfrom the deep inner core) the shape of the magnetic energy spectrum becomes\ninvariant. We find that this shift in the behaviour of the magnetic energy\nspectrum signifies a change in the dynamics of the system as electric current\nbecomes important.

This research proposes to explore the notion of\nprioritization of regions (subsets) in LDs for change detection with the aim of\nachieving optimal accuracy and efficient use of available computational\nresources. This will facilitate the detection of changes in an evolving LD at\nfrequent intervals and will allow the applications to update their data closest\nto real-time data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 00:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Since most existing machine learning based classifiers\nnormalize images into some continuous, real vector, domain firstly, attacks\noften craft adversarial examples in such domain. However, \"adversarial\"\nexamples may become benign after denormalizing them back into the discrete\ninteger domain, known as the discretization problem. This problem was mentioned\nin some work, but has received relatively little attention.\n  In this work, we first conduct a comprehensive study of existing methods and\ntools for crafting. We theoretically analyze 34 representative methods and\nempirically study 20 representative open source tools for crafting adversarial\nimages. Our study reveals that the discretization problem is far more serious\nthan originally thought. This suggests that the discretization problem should\nbe taken into account seriously when crafting adversarial examples and\nmeasuring attack success rate. As a first step towards addressing this problem\nin black-box scenario, we propose a black-box method which reduces the\nadversarial example searching problem to a derivative-free optimization\nproblem. Our method is able to craft adversarial images by derivative-free\nsearch in the discrete integer domain. Experimental results show that our\nmethod is comparable to recent white-box methods (e.g., FGSM, BIM and C\\&W) and\nachieves significantly higher success rate in terms of adversarial examples in\nthe discrete integer domain than recent black-box methods (e.g., ZOO, NES-PGD\nand Bandits). Moreover, our method is able to handle models that is\nnon-differentiable and successfully break the winner of NIPS 2017 competition\non defense with 95\\% success rate.

A greedy heuristic fed by publicly available\nAS relationship data iteratively builds the set of ASes to poison. Given a\ncompromised BGP speaker with advantageous positioning relative to the target\nlink in the Internet topology, an adversary can expect to enhance total flow\ndensity by more than 30%.

To understand the scope of the attack, we\nevaluate widespread Internet link vulnerability across several metrics,\nincluding BGP betweenness and botnet flow density.

Furthermore, we made comprehensive\nanalyses on the unfolding pathway for various RNA pseudoknots in ion solutions.\nOur analyses for extensive pseudokonts and the wide range of\nmonovalent/divalent ion concentrations verify that the unfolding pathway of RNA\npseudoknots is mainly dependent on the relative stability of unfolded\nintermediate states, and show that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots can\nbe significantly modulated by their sequences and solution ion conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 03:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

It is shown that the\nincoherent radiation by bunches of particles traversing normally an isotropic\ndispersive medium (the edge, transition, and Vavilov-Cherenkov radiations) and\nby bunches moving in a helical undulator does not depend on the azimuthal\ndistribution of particles in the bunch and is the same as for round bunches. As\nfor planar undulators, the incoherent radiation by particle bunches is the same\nas for the bunches symmetric under reflection with respect to the axis of a\ntwisted photon detector. At high energies of recorded twisted photons, this\nproperty is universal and holds for the forward incoherent radiation by any\ncold relativistic particle bunch. The coherent radiation of twisted photons by\nsuch particle bunches obeys the property that we call the addition rule. This\nrule provides a simple means to describe the properties of coherent radiation\nof twisted photons.

How to manage traffic smartly by intelligent signal\ncontrol is a significant challenge in urban traffic management. With recent\nadvances in machine learning, especially reinforcement learning (RL), traffic\nsignal control using advanced machine learning techniques represents a\npromising solution to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose a RL\napproach for traffic signal control at urban intersections. Specifically, we\nuse neural networks as Q-function approximator (a.k.a. Q-network) to deal with\nthe complex traffic signal control problem where the state space is large and\nthe action space can be discrete. The state space is defined based on real-time\ntraffic information, i.e. vehicle position, direction and speed. The action\nspace includes various traffic signal phases which are critical in generating a\nreasonable and realistic control mechanism, given the prominent\nspatial-temporal characteristics of urban traffic. In the simulation\nexperiment, we use SUMO, an open source traffic simulator, to construct\nrealistic urban intersection settings. Moreover, we use different traffic\npatterns, such as major/minor road traffic, through/left-turn lane traffic,\ntidal traffic, and varying demand traffic, to train a generalized traffic\nsignal control model that can be adapted to various traffic conditions. The\nsimulation results demonstrate the convergence and generalization performance\nof our RL approach as well as its significant benefits in terms of queue length\nand wait time over several benchmarking methods in traffic signal control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 07:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

One of the major differences between hypercubes and skip graphs is\nthat hypercubes are more rigid in structure compared skip graphs.

The focus of\nthis work is to describe late-time-accelerated expansion. Since finding\nanalytical solutions carrying all conserved currents emerged by Noether\nsymmetry approach, is very difficult, hence regularly in the literature, the\nauthors split the total symmetry into sub-symmetries and then select, usually,\nsome of them to be carried by the solutions. This manner limits the forms of\nunknown functions obtained. However, in ref.

In this paper, by eliminating the\naforementioned limitation as much as possible, a trick leading to some graceful\nforms of unknown functions is suggested.

Of\nthese techniques, deductive verification is highly expressive but requires the\nuser to annotate the system with inductive invariants. To relieve the user from\nthis labor-intensive and challenging task, invariant inference aims to find\ninductive invariants automatically. Unfortunately, when applied to\ninfinite-state systems such as distributed protocols, existing inference\ntechniques often diverge, which limits their applicability.\n  This paper proposes user-guided invariant inference based on phase\ninvariants, which capture the different logical phases of the protocol. Users\nconveys their intuition by specifying a phase structure, an automaton with\nedges labeled by program transitions; the tool automatically infers assertions\nthat hold in the automaton's states, resulting in a full safety proof.The\nadditional structure from phases guides the inference procedure towards finding\nan invariant.\n  Our results show that user guidance by phase structures facilitates\nsuccessful inference beyond the state of the art. We find that phase structures\nare pleasantly well matched to the intuitive reasoning routinely used by domain\nexperts to understand why distributed protocols are correct, so that providing\na phase structure reuses this existing intuition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 13:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Given that the AP's\nresources are shared by selfish users, pricing is a useful tool for\nincentivising users to internalize the negative externality of delay they cause\nto other users. Nevertheless, different users have different negative\nvaluations towards delay as some are more delay sensitive. To serve\nheterogeneous users, we propose a priority pricing scheme where users can get\nserved first for a higher price. Our goal is to find the prices such that in\ndecision making, users will choose the class and the offloading frequency that\njointly maximize social welfare. With the assumption that the AP knows users'\nprofit functions, we derive in semi-closed form the optimal prices. However in\npractice, the reporting of users's profit information incurs a large signalling\noverhead. Besides, in reality users might falsely report their private profit\ninformation. To overcome this, we further propose a learning-based pricing\nmechanism where no knowledge of individual user profit functions is required.\nAt equilibrium, the optimal prices and average edge delays are learnt, and\nusers have chosen the correct priority class and offload at the socially\noptimal frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 14:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 09:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The\nimportance of this development is not necessarily that particular aspects such\nas $C_6$ coefficients or binding energies are improved, but rather that our\nfinding opens the door for further conceptual developments of an entirely\nunexplored direction within the exact same constrained-based non-local\nframework that made vdW-DF so successful in the first place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 15:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}
