Software engineers usually report bugs to bug\ntracking system, and label them as security bug reports (SBRs) or not-security\nbug reports (NSBRs), while SBRs have a higher priority to be fixed before\nexploited by attackers than NSBRs. Yet suspected security bug reports are often\npublicly disclosed because the mislabelling issues ( i.e., mislabel security\nbug reports as not-security bug report). The goal of this paper is to aid\nsoftware developers to better classify bug reports that identify security\nvulnerabilities as security bug reports through parameter tuning of learners\nand data pre-processor. Previous work has applied text analytics and machine\nlearning learners to classify which reported bugs are security related. We\nimprove on that work, as shown by our analysis of five open source projects. We\napply hyperparameter optimization to (a)~the control parameters of a learner;\nand (b)~the data pre-processing methods that handle the case where the target\nclass is a small fraction of all the data. We show that optimizing the\npre-processor is more useful than optimizing the learners. We also show that\nimprovements gained from our approach can be very large. For example, using the\nsame data sets as recently analyzed by our baseline approach, we show that\nadjusting the data pre-processing results in improvements to classification\nrecall of 35% to 65% (median to max) with moderate increment of false positive\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 16:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

Product Quantization (PQ) is a widespread NN search technique which\nhas a high performance and good scalability. PQ compresses high-dimensional\nvectors into compact codes thanks to a combination of quantizers. Large\ndatabases can, therefore, be stored entirely in RAM, enabling fast responses to\nNN queries. In almost all cases, PQ uses 8-bit quantizers as they offer low\nresponse times. In this paper, we advocate the use of 16-bit quantizers.\nCompared to 8-bit quantizers, 16-bit quantizers boost accuracy but they\nincrease response time by a factor of 3 to 10. We propose a novel approach that\nallows 16-bit quantizers to offer the same response time as 8-bit quantizers,\nwhile still providing a boost of accuracy. Our approach builds on two key\nideas: (i) the construction of derived codebooks that allow a fast and\napproximate distance evaluation, and (ii) a two-pass NN search procedure which\nbuilds a candidate set using the derived codebooks, and then refines it using\n16-bit quantizers. On 1 billion SIFT vectors, with an inverted index, our\napproach offers a Recall@100 of 0.85 in 5.2 ms. By contrast, 16-bit quantizers\nalone offer a Recall@100 of 0.85 in 39 ms, and 8-bit quantizers a Recall@100 of\n0.82 in 3.8 ms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 16:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

In particular, our analysis covers networks with\ngenerators of heterogeneous ratings and richer dynamic models of machines.\nUnder a suitable proportionality assumption in the parameters, we show that the\nstep response of bus frequencies can be decomposed in two components. The first\ncomponent is a {system-wide frequency} that captures the aggregate grid\nbehavior, and the residual component represents the individual bus frequency\ndeviations from the aggregate. Using this decomposition, we define --and\ncompute in closed form-- several metrics that capture dynamic behaviors that\nare of relevance for power engineers. In particular, using the \\emph{system\nfrequency}, we define industry-style metrics (Nadir, RoCoF) that are evaluated\nthrough a representative machine.

In this context,\nan imprimitive scheme is one which admits a subalgebra of block matrices, also\nclosed under the Schur product. Such systems of imprimitivity provide us with\nquotient schemes, smaller association schemes which are often easier to\nunderstand, providing useful information about the structure of the larger\nscheme. For any association scheme we find a basis of $d+1$ idempotent matrices\nfor the algebra. A cometric scheme is one whose idempotent basis may be ordered\n$E_0,E_1,...,E_d$ with polynomials $f_0,f_1,...,f_d$ giving $f_i\\circ(E_1)=E_i$\nand deg$(f_i)=i$ for each $i$. Throughout this thesis we are primarily\ninterested in three goals: building new examples of cometric schemes, drawing\nconnections between cometric schemes and other objects, and finding new\nrealizability conditions on feasible parameter sets --- using these conditions\nto rule out open parameter sets when possible. After introducing association\nschemes, this thesis focuses on a few recent results regarding cometric schemes\nwith small $d$. We begin by examining the matrix algebra, looking for low rank\npositive semidefinite matrices with few distinct entries and later establishing\nnew conditions on realizable parameter sets. We then focus on imprimitive\nexamples of both 3- and 4-class cometric schemes, generating new examples of\nthe former while building realizability conditions for both. In each case, we\nexamine the related $t$-distance sets, giving conditions which work towards\nequivalence; in the case of 3-class $Q$-antipodal schemes an equivalence is\nestablished.

The linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric\ninstability is formally equivalent to the salt fingering instability.

During migration, individual cells can\ngenerate active pulling forces via actin filament contraction, which are\ntransmitted to the ECM fibers through focal adhesion complexes, remodel the\nECM, and eventually propagate to and can be sensed by other cells in the\nsystem. The microstructure and physical properties of the ECM can also\nsignificantly influence cell migration, e.g., via durotaxis and contact\nguidance. Here, we develop a computational model for cell migration regulated\nby cell-ECM micro-mechanical coupling. Our model explicitly takes into account\na variety of cellular level processes including focal adhesion formation and\ndisassembly, active traction force generation and cell locomotion due to actin\nfilament contraction, transmission and propagation of tensile forces in the\nECM, as well as the resulting ECM remodeling.

Herein,\nwe present an inexpensive first-principles method devoted to evaluating\nvibration-induced spin relaxation in molecular f-block single-ion magnets, with\nthe important advantage of requiring only one CASSCF calculation. We use a case\nstudy to illustrate the method, and propose chemical modifications in the\nligand environment with the aim of suppressing spin relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 18:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 21:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

This article hypothesizes that\nthe radioprotecting effect of FLASH irradiation could be due to the specific\nsparing of hypoxic stem cell niches, which have been identified in several\norgans including the bone marrow and the brain. To explore this hypothesis, a\nnew computational model is presented that frames transient radiolytic oxygen\ndepletion (ROD) during FLASH irradiation in terms of its effect on the oxygen\nenhancement ratio (OER). The model takes into consideration oxygen diffusion\nthrough the tissue, its consumption by metabolic cells, and its radiolytic\ndepletion to estimate the relative decrease in radiosensitivity of cells\nreceiving FLASH irradiation. Based on this model, several predictions are made\nthat could be tested in future experiments: (1) the FLASH effect should\ngradually disappear as the radiation pulse duration is increased from <1s to 10\ns; (2) dose should be deposited using the smallest number of radiation pulses\nto achieve the greatest FLASH effect; (3) a FLASH effect should only be\nobserved in cells that are already hypoxic at the time of irradiation; and (4)\nchanges in capillary oxygen tension (increase or decrease) should diminish the\nFLASH effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 18:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 22:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

For this reason, there are many published studies on\nhow to calculate a single effective wavenumber. Here we present a proof that\nthere does not exist a unique effective wavenumber; instead, there are an\ninfinite number of such (complex) wavenumbers. We show that in most parameter\nregimes only a small number of these effective wavenumbers make a significant\ncontribution to the wave field.

For clarity, we present results for scalar\n(acoustic) waves for a two-dimensional material filled (over a half space) with\nrandomly distributed circular cylindrical inclusions.

In this work, we study how to enable service robots to use\nhuman multi-modal data to understand object manipulation actions, and how they\ncan recognize such actions when humans perform them during human-robot\ncollaboration tasks. The multi-modal data in this study consists of videos,\nhand motion data, applied forces as represented by the pressure patterns on the\nhand, and measurements of the bending of the fingers, collected as human\nsubjects performed manipulation actions. We investigate two different\napproaches. In the first one, we show that multi-modal signal (motion, finger\nbending and hand pressure) generated by the action can be decomposed into a set\nof primitives that can be seen as its building blocks. These primitives are\nused to define 24 multi-modal primitive features. The primitive features can in\nturn be used as an abstract representation of the multi-modal signal and\nemployed for action recognition. In the latter approach, the visual features\nare extracted from the data using a pre-trained image classification deep\nconvolutional neural network. The visual features are subsequently used to\ntrain the classifier. We also investigate whether adding data from other\nmodalities produces a statistically significant improvement in the classifier\nperformance. We show that both approaches produce a comparable performance.\nThis implies that image-based methods can successfully recognize human actions\nduring human-robot collaboration. On the other hand, in order to provide\ntraining data for the robot so it can learn how to perform object manipulation\nactions, multi-modal data provides a better alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 19:47:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 15:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

A modern web-based UI is an amalgam of reports\nfrom dozens of microservices written by multiple teams. Queries on a page that\nopens up another will fail if any of that page's microservices fails. As a\nresult, the overall cost for automated UI testing is high since the UI elements\ncannot be tested in isolation. For example, the entire automated UI testing\nsuite at LexisNexis takes around 30 hours (3-5 hours on the cloud) to execute,\nwhich slows down the continuous integration process.\n  To mitigate this problem and give developers faster feedback on their code,\ntest case prioritization techniques are used to reorder the automated UI test\ncases so that more failures can be detected earlier. Given that much of the\nautomated UI testing is \"black box\" in nature, very little information (only\nthe test case descriptions and testing results) can be utilized to prioritize\nthese automated UI test cases. Hence, this paper evaluates 17 \"black box\" test\ncase prioritization approaches that do not rely on source code information.\nAmong these, we propose a novel TCP approach, that dynamically re-prioritizes\nthe test cases when new failures are detected, by applying and adapting a state\nof the art framework from the total recall problem.

The prevalence\nof machine learning techniques has raised concerns about the potential for\nlearned algorithms to become biased against certain groups. Many definitions\nhave been proposed in the literature, but the fundamental task of reasoning\nabout probabilistic events is a challenging one, owing to the intractability of\ninference.\n  The focus of this paper is taking steps towards the application of tractable\nmodels to fairness. Tractable probabilistic models have emerged that guarantee\nthat conditional marginal can be computed in time linear in the size of the\nmodel. In particular, we show that sum product networks (SPNs) enable an\neffective technique for determining the statistical relationships between\nprotected attributes and other training variables. If a subset of these\ntraining variables are found by the SPN to be independent of the training\nattribute then they can be considered `safe' variables, from which we can train\na classification model without concern that the resulting classifier will\nresult in disparate outcomes for different demographic groups.\n  Our initial experiments on the `German Credit' data set indicate that this\nprocessing technique significantly reduces disparate treatment of male and\nfemale credit applicants, with a small reduction in classification accuracy\ncompared to state of the art. We will also motivate the concept of \"fairness\nthrough percentile equivalence\", a new definition predicated on the notion that\nindividuals at the same percentile of their respective distributions should be\ntreated equivalently, and this prevents unfair penalisation of those\nindividuals who lie at the extremities of their respective distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 20:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 13:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

Transport is achieved by the\nimplementation of spatial stimulated adiabatic Raman passage through the\noptical control of the NV center charge states and the confined conduction\nstates of a diamond nanostructure. Our models show that for two NV centers in a\ndiamond nanowire, high fidelity transport can be achieved over distances of\norder hundreds of nanometres in timescales of order hundreds of nanoseconds.\nSpatial adiabatic passage is therefore a promising option for realizing an\non-chip spin quantum bus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 01:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

We comprehensively explore the three-dimensional\nparameter space that consists of detuning, pump amplitude, and mode\ncircumference in order to determine where stable solutions exist. To carry out\nthis task, we use a unique set of computational tools based on dynamical system\ntheory that allow us to rapidly and accurately determine the stable region for\neach cnoidal wave periodicity and to find the instability mechanisms and their\ntime scales. Finally, we focus on the soliton limit, and we show that the\nstable region for single solitons almost completely overlaps the stable region\nfor both continuous waves and several higher-periodicity cnoidal waves that are\neffectively multiple soliton trains.

A fundamental function for safer auto-driving is to recognize the\nvehicles' locations, termed vehicular positioning. The state-of-the-art\nvehicular positioning is to rely on anchors that are stationary objects whose\nlocations are known, i.e. satellites for GPS and base stations for cellular\npositioning. It is important for reliable positioning to install anchors\ndensely, helping find enough anchors nearby. For the deployment to be\ncost-effective, there are some trials to use backscatter tags as alternative\nanchors by deploying them on a road surface, but its gain is limited by several\nreasons such as short contact time and difficulties in maintenance. Instead, we\npropose a new backscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning system where tags\nare deployed along a roadside, which enables the extension of contact duration\nand facilitates the maintenance. On the other hand, there is a location\nmismatch between the vehicle and the tag, calling for developing a new\nbackscatter transmission to estimate their relative position. To this end, we\ndesign a novel waveform called joint frequency-and-phase modulation (JFPM) for\nbackscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning where a transmit frequency is\nmodulated for the distance estimation assuming that the relevant signal is\nclearly differentiable from the others while the phase modulation helps the\ndifferentiation. The JFPM waveform leads to exploiting the maximum\nDegree-of-Freedoms (DoFs) of backscatter channel in which multiple-access and\nbroadcasting channels coexist, leading to more accurate positioning verified by\nextensive simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 06:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

As the formalism of mathematical models offering\nanalytical solutions is often not suitable for representing social complexity,\nmore and more agent-based computer models are being used. For a long time, the\nlimited computing capacities of computers have hampered programming models that\nwould take into account the interactions between large numbers of\ngeographically located entities (persons or territories).

Moreover, even\nthough smart contract execution follows a two-phase style, i.e, the miner node\nexecutes a batch of smart contracts in the first phase and the validators\nreplay them in the second phase, existing parallel solutions only focus on the\noptimization in the first phase, but not including the second phase.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel efficient concurrency control scheme which\nis the first one to do optimization in both phases.

The key point in the limit process is\nthe definition of macroscopic tensile and compressive stresses, which are\ndetermined by the unilateral conditions on contact surfaces and the geometry of\nthe blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 09:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

When a\npixel is on an edge, placing the center of the window on the pixel is one of\nthe fundamental reasons that cause many filtering algorithms to blur the edges.\nBased on this insight, we propose a new Side Window Filtering (SWF) technique\nwhich aligns the window's side or corner with the pixel being processed. The\nSWF technique is surprisingly simple yet theoretically rooted and very\neffective in practice. We show that many traditional linear and nonlinear\nfilters can be easily implemented under the SWF framework.

We here show that a simple thermodynamics approach can actually account\nfor such complex crack dynamics, and in particular for the non-monotonic\nforce-velocity curves commonly observed in mechanical tests on various\nmaterials. We consider a thermally activated failure process that is coupled\nwith the production and the diffusion of heat at the fracture tip. In this\nframework, the rise in temperature only affects the sub-critical crack dynamics\nand not the mechanical properties of the material. We show that this\ndescription can quantitatively reproduce the rupture of two different polymeric\nmaterials (namely, the mode I opening of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates,\nand the peeling of pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tapes), from the very slow\nto the very fast fracturing regimes, over seven to nine decades of crack\npropagation velocities. In particular, the fastest regime is obtained with an\nincrease of temperature of thousands of kelvins, on the molecular scale around\nthe crack tip. Although surprising, such an extreme temperature is actually\nconsistent with different experimental observations that accompany the fast\npropagation of cracks, namely, fractoluminescence (i.e., the emission of\nvisible light during rupture) and a complex morphology of post-mortem fracture\nsurfaces, which could be due to the sublimation of bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 09:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 10:56:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 15:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

Incorporating this model into\nMonte-Carlo simulations shows that (i) the competition between the long-range\nCoulomb interaction (due to bound charges) and short-range interaction (due to\nopposite dipoles) is responsible for the formation of these peculiar domain\nwalls and (ii) their relative strength is critical in determining the\nperiodicity of these sawtooth-shaped domain walls. Necessary conditions to form\nsuch domain walls are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 10:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 May 2019 07:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 06:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 09:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The data of mobile\nclients is typically non-IID owing to diversity among mobile clients' interests\nand usage, and FL with non-IID data could degrade the model performance.\nTherefore, to mitigate the degradation induced by non-IID data, we assume that\na limited number (e.g., less than 1%) of clients allow their data to be\nuploaded to a server, and we propose a hybrid learning mechanism referred to as\nHybrid-FL, wherein the server updates the model using the data gathered from\nthe clients and aggregates the model with the models trained by clients. The\nHybrid-FL solves both client- and data-selection problems via heuristic\nalgorithms, which try to select the optimal sets of clients who train models\nwith their own data, clients who upload their data to the server, and data\nuploaded to the server.

We first consider the equilibrium properties of\ndroplets on different surfaces, we show that for small stripes the\nCassie-Baxter equation gives a good approximation of the equilibrium contact\nangle. As the stripe width becomes non-negligible compared to the dimension of\nthe droplets, the droplet has to deform significantly to minimize its free\nenergy, this results in a smaller value of the contact angle than the continuum\nmodel predicts. We then evaluate the slip length, and thus the damping\ncoefficient as a function of the stripe width. For very small stripes, the\nheterogeneous surface behaves as an effective surface, with the same damping as\nan homogeneous surface with the same contact angle. However, as the stripe\nwidth increases, damping at the surface increases until reaching a plateau.\nAfterwards, we study the dynamics of droplets under a bulk force. We show that\nif the stripes are large enough the droplets are pinned until a critical\nacceleration. The critical acceleration increases linearly with stripe width.\nFor large enough accelerations, the average velocity increases linearly with\nthe acceleration, we show that it can then be predicted by a model depending\nonly the size of droplet, viscosity and slip length. We show that the velocity\nof the droplet varies sinusoidally as a function of its position on the\nsubstrate. On the other hand, for accelerations just above the depinning\nacceleration we observe a characteristic stick-slip motion, with successive\npinnings and depinnings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 11:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Though the value of\ndielectric constant is decreased with the increase in doping content, the\noptimum composition Nd0.005Li0.005Zn0.99O exhibits slightly lower dielectric\nconstant (2066 at 1 KHz) than pristine ZnO but relatively very low dielectric\nloss (0.20 at 1 KHz) at room temperature than pure ZnO ceramics sintered at\n1623 K. For understanding the dielectric relaxation mechanism in the studied\nceramics, complex impedance spectra analysis have also been performed and\ndiscussed thoroughly. This study provides a new insight for further development\nof colossal permittivity (CP) ceramics and extends the current understanding of\nCP mechanism in ceramic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 12:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 12:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

One\ncommon approach is to measure the difference between two policies in a\nprobabilistic way, such as importance sampling and tree-backup. However,\nexisting off-policy learning methods based on probabilistic policy measurement\nare inefficient when utilizing traces under a greedy target policy, which is\nineffective for control problems. The traces are cut immediately when a\nnon-greedy action is taken, which may lose the advantage of eligibility traces\nand slow down the learning process. Alternatively, some non-probabilistic\nmeasurement methods such as General Q($\\lambda$) and Naive Q($\\lambda$) never\ncut traces, but face convergence problems in practice. To address the above\nissues, this paper introduces a new method named TBQ($\\sigma$), which\neffectively unifies the tree-backup algorithm and Naive Q($\\lambda$).

At the same time, generative models were proposed\nthat can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success in\nthese closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received\nlittle attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are\neither limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups.\nA major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture\nare inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In\nthis paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is\nbased on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural\nnetwork. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization\nand parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of\nthe shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are able\nto represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deep\nlearning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields compare\nfavorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of\n3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturing\nunseen 3D models.

A\nsecondary flow consisting of eight vortices is observed to recirculate the\nfluid from the corners to the core. Their extent and intensity grows with\nincreasing $Re^*$. The second objective of this study is to explore the change\nin flow in the presence of particles. Almost neutrally-buoyant finite-size\nspherical particles with duct height, $2H$, to particle diameter, $d_p$, ratio\nof 12 are used at two volume fractions $\\phi$ = 5 and 10\\%. Particle Tracking\nVelocimetry (PTV) is used to measure the velocity of these\nrefractive-index-matched spheres, and PIV to extract the fluid velocity. Simple\nshadowgraphy is also used for qualitatively visualising the development of the\nparticle distribution along the streamwise direction. The particle distribution\npattern changes from being concentrated at the four corners, at low flow rates,\nto being focussed along a diffused ring between the center and the corners, at\nhigh flow rates. The presence of particles induces streamwise and wall-normal\nvelocity fluctuations in the fluid phase; however, the primary Reynolds shear\nstress is still very small compared to turbulent flows. The size of the plug in\nthe particle-laden cases appears to be smaller than the corresponding single\nphase cases.

Alternatively, other problems try to determine the subsets of points\nwith a given cardinality, that maximize the basin of domination, the {\\it\npartial dominating set}. Since a discrete time series can be viewed as an\nordered set of points in the plane, the dominating number and the partial\ndominating set can be used to obtain additional information about the\nvisibility properties of the series; in particular, the total visibility number\nand the partial visibility set.

We present the results of these\nNuSTAR observations, combined with archival Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations, and confirm the previous X-ray photon index of $\\Gamma_{2-20 \\rm\\\nkeV} = 2.0 \\pm 0.1$. We find no spectral cutoff up to 20 keV. With the spectral\ninformation for DA 495 extended to TeV gamma-rays, we were able to perform\nanalytical modeling to test leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios. The\nleptonic models can explain the broadband emission, but also imply a diffuse\nX-ray nebula of similar extent to the radio and TeV nebulae, which cannot be\nconfirmed by our observations. The hadronic models can simultaneously explain\nthe spectrum and the spatial extent in all wavelengths; however, we need a very\nhigh magnetic field strength pervading the radio and TeV nebulae and a\nsurprisingly high particle kinetic energy. These requirements deepen the\nmystery of the physical nature of DA 495. Future observations in radio to\ninfrared bands and spatially resolved $\\gamma$-rays can further constrain the\nphysical conditions and radiation mechanisms in DA 495.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 15:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The algorithm queries pairs of\nnodes and observes the presence/absence of edges. Its goal is to discover as\nmany edges as possible with a fixed budget of queries. Pair-matching is a\nparticular instance of multi-armed bandit problem in which the arms are pairs\nof individuals and the rewards are edges linking these pairs.

This development motivated research to develop faster\nalgorithms that target graph pattern matching. In recent years, the database\ncommunity has shown that mapping graph pattern matching problems to a new class\nof relational join algorithms provides an efficient framework for computing\nthese problems.\n  In this paper, we argue that this new class of relational join algorithms is\nhighly amenable to specialized hardware acceleration thanks to two fundamental\nproperties: improved locality and inherent concurrency. The improved locality\nis a result of the provably bound number of intermediate results these\nalgorithms generate, which results in smaller working sets. In addition, their\ninherent concurrency can be leveraged for effective hardware acceleration and\nhiding memory latency. We demonstrate the hardware amenability of this new\nclass of algorithms by introducing TrieJax, a hardware accelerator for graph\npattern matching. The TrieJax design leverages the improved locality and high\nconcurrency properties to dramatically accelerate graph pattern matching, and\ncan be tightly integrated into existing manycore processors.\n  We evaluate TrieJax on a set standard graph pattern matching queries and\ndatasets.

Using this model, we calculate\nanalytical forms for the steady-state equilibrium pressure gradient and\npressure profile for circular and spherical bubbles and flat interfaces in two\nand three dimensions. According to the analytical solutions, the pressure\nchanges continuously across the interface in a way that is quantitatively\nsimilar to what is observed in MD simulations. Furthermore, the pressure\ndifference $P_{\\varepsilon, in} - P_{\\varepsilon, out}$ satisfies the\nYoung-Laplace law for the radius of curvature greater than $3\\varepsilon$ and\ndeviates from the Young-Laplace law otherwise (i.e., $P_{\\varepsilon, in} -\nP_{\\varepsilon, out}$ goes to zero as the radius of the curvature goes to zero,\nwhere $P_{\\varepsilon, out}$ is the pressure outside of the bubble at the\ndistance greater than $3\\varepsilon$ from the interface and $P_{\\varepsilon,\nin}$ is the pressure at the center of the bubble). The latter indicates that\nthe surface tension in the proposed model decreases with the decreasing radius\nof curvature, which agrees with molecular dynamics simulations and laboratory\nexperiments with nanobubbles.

A\nmain tool was denominator reduction which allowed the authors to examine graphs\nup to loop order (first Betti number) 10. We introduce an improved quadratic\ndenominator reduction which makes it possible to extend the previous results to\nloop order 11 (and partially orders 12 and 13). For comparison, also\nnon-$\\phi^4$ graphs are investigated. Here, we extend the results from loop\norder 9 to 10. The new database of 4801 unique $c_2$-invariants (previously\n157) -- while being consistent with all major $c_2$-conjectures -- leads to a\nmore refined picture of perturbative quantum geometries. In the appendix,\nFriedrich Knop proves a Chevalley-Warning-Ax theorem for double covers of\naffine space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 15:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 13:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

However, existing evaluation platforms are either not\ncompatible with multi-agent settings, or limited to a specific game. That is,\nthere is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent\nintelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform\nfor multi-agent intelligence with 35 games of diverse logics and\nrepresentations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage\nwhere many problems remain unexplored. Therefore, we provide a building toolkit\nfor researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the\nprovided game set based on a GUI-configurable social tree and five basic\nmulti-agent reward schemes. Finally, we provide Python implementations of five\nstate-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with\nthe baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we\ncan train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for\nevaluating agents with population performance.

Since the states are not directly\nobservable in a POMDP, decision making has to be performed based on the output\nof a Bayesian filter (continuous beliefs). Hence, POMDPs are often\ncomputationally intractable to solve exactly and researchers resort to\napproximate methods often using discretizations of the continuous belief space.\nThese approximate solutions are, however, prone to discretization errors, which\nhas made POMDPs ineffective in applications, wherein guarantees for safety,\noptimality, or performance are required. To overcome the complexity challenge\nof POMDPs, we apply notions from control theory. The goal is to determine the\nreachable belief space of a POMDP, that is, the set of all possible evolutions\ngiven an initial belief distribution over the states and a set of actions and\nobservations. We begin by casting the problem of analyzing a POMDP into\nanalyzing the behavior of a discrete-time switched system. For estimating the\nreachable belief space, we find over-approximations in terms of sub-level sets\nof Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, in order to verify safety and optimality\nrequirements of a given POMDP, we formulate a barrier certificate theorem,\nwherein we show that if there exists a barrier certificate satisfying a set of\ninequalities along with the belief update equation of the POMDP, the safety and\noptimality properties are guaranteed to hold. In both cases, we show how the\ncalculations can be decomposed into smaller problems that can be solved in\nparallel.

To obviate this issue, a new\ncooperative jamming scheme is proposed in this paper, in which the data can be\nconfidentially communicated from the source to the destination through multiple\nuntrusted relays. In our proposed secure transmission scheme, all the\nlegitimate nodes contribute to providing secure communication by intelligently\ninjecting artificial noises to the network in different communication phases.\nFor the sake of analysis, we consider a multi-hop untrusted relaying network\nwith two successive intermediate nodes, i.e, a three-hop communications\nnetwork. Given this system model, a new closed-form expression is presented in\nthe high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region for the Ergodic secrecy rate (ESR).\nFurthermore, we evaluate the high SNR slope and power offset of the ESR to gain\nan insightful comparison of the proposed secure transmission scheme and the\nstate-of-arts. Our numerical results highlight that the proposed secure\ntransmission scheme provides better secrecy rate performance compared with the\ntwo-hop untrusted relaying as well as the direct transmission schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 12:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 16:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

In this paper, we formalize the\nPME task into the multi-grained text classification problem, and propose a\nhierarchical neural network to effectively model and extract multi-grained\ninformation without manually-defined procedural features. Under this structure,\nwe accordingly propose the coarse-to-fine (grained) learning mechanism,\ntraining multi-grained tasks in coarse-to-fine grained order to share the\nhigh-level knowledge for the low-level tasks. To evaluate our approach, we\nconstruct two multi-grained datasets from two different domains and conduct\nextensive experiments from different dimensions.
