For instance, one could\nestimate the impact of a new drug on specific individuals to assist the clinic\nplan and improve the survival rate. In this paper, we focus on studying the\nproblem of estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) from\nobservational data. The challenges for this problem are two-fold: on the one\nhand, we have to derive a causal estimator to estimate the causal quantity from\nobservational data, where there exists confounding bias; on the other hand, we\nhave to deal with the identification of CATE when the distribution of\ncovariates in treatment and control groups are imbalanced. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a neural network framework called Adversarial\nBalancing-based representation learning for Causal Effect Inference (ABCEI),\nbased on the recent advances in representation learning. To ensure the\nidentification of CATE, ABCEI uses adversarial learning to balance the\ndistributions of covariates in treatment and control groups in the latent\nrepresentation space, without any assumption on the form of the treatment\nselection/assignment function. In addition, during the representation learning\nand balancing process, highly predictive information from the original\ncovariate space might be lost. ABCEI can tackle this information loss problem\nby preserving useful information for predicting causal effects under the\nregularization of a mutual information estimator. The experimental results show\nthat ABCEI is robust against treatment selection bias, and matches/outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art approaches. Our experiments show promising results on\nseveral datasets, representing different health care domains among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 16:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 11:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 21:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

As a\nresult, many approaches are forced to use workarounds for mathematically\nunambiguously solvable problems. Methods: PYRO-NN is a generalized framework to\nembed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow.\nThe current status includes state-of-the-art parallel-, fan- and cone-beam\nprojectors and back-projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow\nlayers.

In this work, we provide a simulation framework for the purpose of\nbetter understanding lithium intercalated graphite and its behaviour during use\nin a battery. In order to address the large systems sizes and long time scales\nrequired to investigate said effects, we identify the highly efficient, but\nsemi-empirical Density Funtional Tight Binding (DFTB) as a suitable approach\nand combine particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the machine learning (ML)\nprocedure Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to obtain the necessary parameters.\nUsing the resulting parametrization, we are able to reproduce experimental\nreference structures at a level of accuracy which is in no way inferior to much\nmore costly ab initio methods. We finally present structural properties and\ndiffusion barriers for some exemplary system states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 16:25:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

Efforts towards protection mechanisms\nthat prevent or limit the success of such threats, however, have been ad-hoc so\nfar and have primarily focused on designing threat-specific customized defense\nmechanisms. Such approaches are not very practical, as evident from their\nlimited adoption within major mobile/wearable operating systems. In the end, it\nis clear that all privacy threats that take advantage of unrestricted access to\nzero-permission sensors can be prevented if access to these sensors is\nregulated. However, due to the dynamic nature of sensor usage and requirements\nof different mobile applications, design of such access control mechanisms is\nnot trivial. To effectively design an automated mobile defense mechanism that\ncan dynamically measure the threat level of different sensor access requests\nfrom different applications and appropriately block suspicious requests, the\nproblem of zero-permission sensor access needs to be first formally defined and\nanalyzed. This paper accomplishes the above objective by employing game theory,\nspecifically, signaling games, to analytically model the sensor access scenario\nfor mobile applications, including, formalizing sensor access strategies of\nmobile applications and defense strategies of the on-board defense mechanism\nand the associated costs and benefits. Within the confines of a formal and\npractical game model, the paper then outlines conditions under which equilibria\ncan be achieved between entities (applications and defense mechanism) with\nconflicting goals. The game model is further analyzed using numerical\nsimulations, and also extended in the form of a repeated signaling game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 16:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Social\nmedia appeals to users due to its fast dissemination of information, low cost,\nand easy access. However, social media also enables the widespread of fake\nnews. Because of the detrimental societal effects of fake news, detecting fake\nnews has attracted increasing attention. However, the detection performance\nonly using news contents is generally not satisfactory as fake news is written\nto mimic true news. Thus, there is a need for an in-depth understanding on the\nrelationship between user profiles on social media and fake news. In this\npaper, we study the challenging problem of understanding and exploiting user\nprofiles on social media for fake news detection. In an attempt to understand\nconnections between user profiles and fake news, first, we measure users'\nsharing behaviors on social media and group representative users who are more\nlikely to share fake and real news; then, we perform a comparative analysis of\nexplicit and implicit profile features between these user groups, which reveals\ntheir potential to help differentiate fake news from real news. To exploit user\nprofile features, we demonstrate the usefulness of these user profile features\nin a fake news classification task. We further validate the effectiveness of\nthese features through feature importance analysis.

Gradient coding is a coding-theoretic\nframework to mitigate stragglers by enabling the server to recover the gradient\nsum in the presence of stragglers. 'Approximate gradient codes' are variants of\ngradient codes that reduce computation and storage overhead per worker by\nallowing the server to approximately reconstruct the gradient sum.\n  In this work, our goal is to construct approximate gradient codes that are\nresilient to stragglers selected by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our\nmotivation for constructing codes to mitigate adversarial stragglers stems from\nthe challenge of tackling stragglers in massive-scale elastic and serverless\nsystems, wherein it is difficult to statistically model stragglers. Towards\nthis end, we propose a class of approximate gradient codes based on balanced\nincomplete block designs (BIBDs). We show that the approximation error for\nthese codes depends only on the number of stragglers, and thus, adversarial\nstraggler selection has no advantage over random selection. In addition, the\nproposed codes admit computationally efficient decoding at the server. Next, to\ncharacterize fundamental limits of adversarial straggling, we consider the\nnotion of 'adversarial threshold' -- the smallest number of workers that an\nadversary must straggle to inflict certain approximation error. We compute a\nlower bound on the adversarial threshold, and show that codes based on\nsymmetric BIBDs maximize this lower bound among a wide class of codes, making\nthem excellent candidates for mitigating adversarial stragglers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The disc radius is a fundamental quantity to\ndiagnose whether discs undergo viscous spreading, discriminating between\nviscosity or angular momentum removal by winds as drivers of disc evolution.\nObservationally, however, the sub-mm continuum emission is dominated by the\ndust, which also drifts inwards, complicating the picture. In this paper we\ninvestigate, using theoretical models of dust grain growth and radial drift,\nhow the radii of dusty viscous proto-planetary discs evolve with time. Despite\nthe existence of a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution, we find that the\nradius enclosing most of the dust $\\textit{mass}$ increases with time, closely\nfollowing the evolution of the gas radius. This behaviour arises because,\nalthough dust initially grows and drifts rapidly onto the star, the residual\ndust retained on Myr timescales is relatively well coupled to the gas.\nObserving the expansion of the dust disc requires using definitions based on\nhigh fractions of the disc $\\textit{flux}$ (e.g. 95 per cent) and very long\nintegrations with ALMA, because the dust grains in the outer part of the disc\nare small and have a low sub-mm opacity. We show that existing surveys lack the\nsensitivity to detect viscous spreading. The disc radii they measure do not\ntrace the mass radius or the sharp outer edge in the dust distribution, but the\nouter limit of where the grains have significant sub-mm opacity. We predict\nthat these observed radii should shrink with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

We\ntreat these strongly coupled modes by evolving their wavepacket dynamics in the\nabsence of additional coupling exactly. The remaining weakly coupled nuclear\ndegrees of freedom are partitioned into modes that are fast relative to the\nnonadiabatic coupling and those that are slow.

Most of\nthe anomalies found have the character of signaling violation of lepton\nuniversality. There are four lepton universality violating anomalies known at\npresent, which we shall fit with one overall scale parameter to order of\nmagnitude accuracy. One can look at the picture that we have found - due to the\nrather strong top Yukawa coupling - as a new sector of strongly interacting\nparticles analogous to quantum color dynamics inside the standard model! In\naddition we treat what is presumably also an anomaly: the experimental value of\nthe direct charge conjugation parity violation parameter epsilon prime over\nepsilon turns out to be a factor 2 or more larger than the standard model\nprediction,but fit our model. However if we include in our anomaly model such\nprocesses not involving leptons (but only quarks), it seems superficially that\nwe obtain very large - and unacceptable - anomalies in meson zero meson zero\nbar etc. mixing. To rescue our model from this falsification, we think of the\ninteracting quarks as provided with clouds (on half terra electron volt scale)\nof, and that too strongly interacting such clouds cannot penetrate into each\nother. Thereby the interactions and thus the resulting anomalies are damped.\nEven with such a crutch for our theory we only barely manage to avoid an\noverlarge anomaly in the indirect charge conjugation parity violation parameter\nepsilon. Our modified model also predicts an anomalous contribution to the\nmeson long to meson short mass difference of the same order of magnitude as the\nexperimental value, which is consistent with the deviation from the standard\nmodel lattice value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 19:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

Demand-aware design is a promising avenue\nfor addressing a critical challenge in ride-sharing systems, namely joint\noptimization of request-vehicle assignment and routing for a fleet of vehicles.\nIn this paper, we develop a probabilistic demand-aware framework to tackle the\nchallenge. We focus on maximizing the expected number of passenger pickups,\ngiven the probability distributions of future demands. The key idea of our\napproach is to assign requests to vehicles in a probabilistic manner. It\ndifferentiates our work from existing ones and allows us to explore a richer\ndesign space to tackle the request-vehicle assignment puzzle with a performance\nguarantee but still keeping the final solution practically implementable. The\noptimization problem is non-convex, combinatorial, and NP-hard in nature. As a\nkey contribution, we explore the problem structure and propose an elegant\napproximation of the objective function to develop a dual-subgradient\nheuristic. We characterize a condition under which the heuristic generates a\n$\\left(1-1/e\\right)$ approximation solution. Our solution is simple and\nscalable, amendable for practical implementation. Results of numerical\nexperiments based on real-world traces in Manhattan show that, as compared to a\nconventional demand-oblivious scheme, our demand-aware solution improves the\npassenger pickups by up to 46%. The results also show that joint optimization\nat the fleet level leads to 19% more pickups than that by separate\noptimizations at individual vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 20:05:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 11:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 05:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Decoding the observed\nmeasurements, a task which is traditionally computationally intensive, is\nperformed using a deep-learning-based approach, facilitating a high-performance\nchannel discovery. Our solution not only outperforms state-of-the-art\ncompressed sensing methods, but it also determines the lower bound on the\nnumber of measurements required for reliable channel discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 22:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 18:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 22:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain,\nwhere patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different\nfrequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections\nin equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these\nissues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation\nand then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the\ndifferent resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named\nMulti-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The\nbuilding block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an\ninformative dense representation at each time step using signal information\nsuch as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp\nand overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which\nalso models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating\nthe informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses\nmultiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further\nfacilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three\nmain contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates\ninformative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating\ntask-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different\nsignals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in\nparallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and\nMulti-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three\npredictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 22:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

This framework is well-suited to many\nreal-world inverse problems, which are typically modelled in\ninfinite-dimensional spaces, and where the application of finite-dimensional\napproaches can lead to noticeable artefacts. Another typical feature of such\nproblems is that the signals are not only sparse in some dictionary, but\npossess a so-called local sparsity in levels structure. Consequently, the\nsampling scheme should be designed so as to exploit this additional structure.\nIn this paper, we introduce a series of uniform recovery guarantees for\ninfinite-dimensional compressed sensing based on sparsity in levels and\nso-called multilevel random subsampling.

More generally, our study shows that analytics of\ndigital records of grocery purchases can be used as a cheap and scalable tool\nfor health surveillance and, upon these records, different stakeholders from\ngovernments to insurance companies to food companies could implement effective\nprevention strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

Given this state of affairs, important questions follow. What\nis the relationship between fairness as defined by computer scientists and\nnotions of social welfare? In this paper, we present a welfare-based analysis\nof classification and fairness regimes. We translate a loss minimization\nprogram into a social welfare maximization problem with a set of implied\nwelfare weights on individuals and groups--weights that can be analyzed from a\ndistribution justice lens. In the converse direction, we ask what the space of\npossible labelings is for a given dataset and hypothesis class. We provide an\nalgorithm that answers this question with respect to linear hyperplanes in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ that runs in $O(n^dd)$. Our main findings on the relationship\nbetween fairness criteria and welfare center on sensitivity analyses of\nfairness-constrained empirical risk minimization programs. We characterize the\nranges of $\\Delta \\epsilon$ perturbations to a fairness parameter $\\epsilon$\nthat yield better, worse, and neutral outcomes in utility for individuals and\nby extension, groups. We show that applying more strict fairness criteria that\nare codified as parity constraints, can worsen welfare outcomes for both\ngroups. More generally, always preferring \"more fair\" classifiers does not\nabide by the Pareto Principle---a fundamental axiom of social choice theory and\nwelfare economics. Recent work in machine learning has rallied around these\nnotions of fairness as critical to ensuring that algorithmic systems do not\nhave disparate negative impact on disadvantaged social groups. By showing that\nthese constraints often fail to translate into improved outcomes for these\ngroups, we cast doubt on their effectiveness as a means to ensure justice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 01:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

A recent important class of such platforms is Fourier\nptychography, which is geared towards efficiently creating gigapixel images\nwith high resolution and large field of view (FOV). In current FP\nimplementations, pupil aberration is often recovered at each small segment of\nthe entire FOV. This reconstruction strategy fails to consider the\nfield-dependent nature of the optical pupil. Given the power series expansion\nof the wavefront aberration, the spatially varying pupil can be fully\ncharacterized by tens of coefficients over the entire FOV.

It is widely believed that hash tables waste a\nconsiderable amount of memory, as they either leave allocated space untouched\n(open addressing) or store additional pointers (separate chaining). For the\nformer, Cleary introduced the compact hashing technique that stores only a part\nof a key to save space. However, as can be seen by the line of research\nfocusing on compact hash tables with open addressing, there is additional\ninformation, called displacement, required for restoring a key. There are\nseveral representations of this displacement information with different space\nand time trade-offs. In this article, we introduce a separate chaining hash\ntable that applies the compact hashing technique without the need for the\ndisplacement information.

Like all nonparametric methods, the\nHP filter depends critically on a tuning parameter that controls the degree of\nsmoothing. Yet in contrast to modern nonparametric methods and applied work\nwith these procedures, empirical practice with the HP filter almost universally\nrelies on standard settings for the tuning parameter that have been suggested\nlargely by experimentation with macroeconomic data and heuristic reasoning. As\nrecent research (Phillips and Jin, 2015) has shown, standard settings may not\nbe adequate in removing trends, particularly stochastic trends, in economic\ndata.\n  This paper proposes an easy-to-implement practical procedure of iterating the\nHP smoother that is intended to make the filter a smarter smoothing device for\ntrend estimation and trend elimination. We call this iterated HP technique the\nboosted HP filter in view of its connection to $L_{2}$-boosting in machine\nlearning. The paper develops limit theory to show that the boosted HP (bHP)\nfilter asymptotically recovers trend mechanisms that involve unit root\nprocesses, deterministic polynomial drifts, and polynomial drifts with\nstructural breaks. A stopping criterion is used to automate the iterative HP\nalgorithm, making it a data-determined method that is ready for modern\ndata-rich environments in economic research. The methodology is illustrated\nusing three real data examples that highlight the differences between simple HP\nfiltering, the data-determined boosted filter, and an alternative\nautoregressive approach. These examples show that the bHP filter is helpful in\nanalyzing a large collection of heterogeneous macroeconomic time series that\nmanifest various degrees of persistence, trend behavior, and volatility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 03:53:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 08:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 05:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

Without loss of\ngenerality, a nonlinear flexible plate is considered here, and is solved by a\nfinite element method based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The\nno-slip boundary condition at the fluid--structure interface is achieved by\nusing a diffusion-interface penalty IB method. With the above proposed method,\nthe aeroacoustics field generated by the moving boundaries and the associated\nflows are inherently solved. In order to validate and verify the current\nmethod, several benchmark cases are conducted: acoustic waves scattered from a\nstationary cylinder in a quiescent flow, sound generation by a stationary and a\nrotating cylinder in a uniform flow, sound generation by an insect in hovering\nflight, deformation of a red blood cell induced by acoustic waves and acoustic\nwaves scattered by a stationary sphere.

This allows us to couple tightly the rate\nestimation with context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding. It also provides a\ndifferentiable distortion objective function.

In this regard, we propose an enhanced\nOFDM-SNM scheme in this paper, which utilizes the flexibility of placing\nsubcarriers to harvest a coding gain in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nregion. In particular, we stipulate a methodology that optimizes the subcarrier\nactivation pattern (SAP) by subcarrier assignment using instantaneous channel\nstate information (CSI) and therefore the subcarriers with higher channel power\ngains will be granted the priority to be activated, given the number of\nsubcarriers is fixed.

Monte Carlo simulations were conducted at three metallicities, and three\nevolutionary stages of the primary.

Recently, general-purpose planners have been\nintroduced, combining behavior and local motion planning. These general-purpose\nplanners allow behavior-aware motion planning given a single reward function.\nHowever, two challenges arise: First, this function has to map a complex\nfeature space into rewards. Second, the reward function has to be manually\ntuned by an expert. Manually tuning this reward function becomes a tedious\ntask. In this paper, we propose an approach that relies on human driving\ndemonstrations to automatically tune reward functions.

Non-inferiority (NI) trials are increasingly used to evaluate new\ntreatments expected to have secondary advantages over standard of care, but\nsimilar efficacy on the primary outcome. When designing a NI trial with a\nbinary primary outcome, the choice of effect measure for the NI margin has an\nimportant effect on sample size calculations; furthermore, if the control event\nrisk observed is markedly different from that assumed, the trial can quickly\nlose power or the results become difficult to interpret. Methods. We propose a\nnew way of designing NI trials to overcome the issues raised by unexpected\ncontrol event risks by specifying a NI frontier, i.e. a curve defining the most\nappropriate non-inferiority margin for each possible value of control event\nrisk. We propose a fixed arcsine difference frontier, the power-stabilising\ntransformation for binary outcomes. We propose and compare three ways of\ndesigning a trial using this frontier. Results. Testing and reporting on the\narcsine scale leads to results which are challenging to interpret clinically.\nWorking on the arcsine scale generally requires a larger sample size compared\nto the risk difference scale. Therefore, working on the risk difference scale,\nmodifying the margin after observing the control event risk, might be\npreferable, as it requires a smaller sample size. However, this approach tends\nto slightly inflate type I error rate; a solution is to use a lower\nsignificance level for testing. When working on the risk ratio scale, the same\napproach leads to power levels above the nominal one, maintaining type I error\nunder control. Conclusions. Our proposed methods of designing NI trials using\npower-stabilising frontiers make trial design more resilient to unexpected\nvalues of the control event risk, at the only cost of requiring larger sample\nsizes when the goal is to report results on the risk difference scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 10:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

In this scenario,\ndensely deploying millimeter wave (mmWave) base stations is a promising\napproach to provide very high transmission speeds to the vehicles. However,\nmmWave signals suffer from high path and penetration losses which might render\nthe communication unreliable and discontinuous. Coexistence between mmWave and\nLong Term Evolution (LTE) communication systems has therefore been considered\nto guarantee increased capacity and robustness through heterogeneous\nnetworking. Following this rationale, we face the challenge of designing fair\nand efficient attachment policies in heterogeneous vehicular networks.\nTraditional methods based on received signal quality criteria lack\nconsideration of the vehicle's individual requirements and traffic demands, and\nlead to suboptimal resource allocation across the network. In this paper we\npropose a Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware attachment scheme which biases the\ncell selection as a function of the vehicular service requirements, preventing\nthe overload of transmission links.

Specifically, industrial\ncommunication network technology such as Profinet has proved to be a major game\nchanger for such automation. However, industrial automation devices often have\nto exhibit robustness to dynamically changing network conditions and thus,\ndemand a rigorous testing environment to avoid any safety-critical failures.\nHence, in this paper, we have proposed an FPGA-based novel framework called\nProfi-Load to generate Profinet traffic with specific intensities for a\nspecified duration of time. The proposed Profi-Load intends to facilitate the\nperformance testing of the industrial automated devices under various network\nconditions. By using the advantage of inherent hardware parallelism and\nre-configurable features of FPGA, Profi-Load is able to generate Profinet\ntraffic efficiently.

A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the\neffectiveness of Profi-Load and it has been observed that Profi-Load is able to\ngenerate precise load at a constant rate for stringent timing requirements.\nFurthermore, a suitable Human Machine Interface (HMI) has also been developed\nfor quick access to our framework.

These choices, however, do not square with the\nnotion of self similarity which is essentially a \"local\" concept. We first\ndemonstrate that the streamwise variations of velocity and length scales in\nwall jets show remarkable scaling with local parameters i.e. there appear to be\nno imposed length and velocity scales. Next, it is shown that the mean velocity\nprofile data suggest existence of two distinct layers - the wall (inner) layer\nand the full-free jet (outer) layer. Each of these layers scales on the\nappropriate length and velocity scales and this scaling is observed to be\nuniversal i.e. independent of the local friction Reynolds number. Analysis\nshows that the overlap of these universal scalings leads to a\nReynolds-number-dependent power-law velocity variation in the overlap layer. It\nis observed that the mean-velocity overlap layer corresponds well to the\nmomentum-balance mesolayer and there appears to be no evidence for an inertial\noverlap; only the meso-overlap is observed.

Somewhat counter-intuitively, the charge\nis transferred from the Ti cations with formal $d^1$ electron configuration to\nthe the V cations with formal $d^2$ configuration, thereby increasing the\noccupation difference of the $t_{2g}$ states.

For\nthe symmetric case, $D_1=D_2\\equiv D$, our results also confirm that the\nequilbrium droplet configuration always has the symmetry of the substrate\ncorresponding to either three isolated drops when $D$ is large or a single\ntriple drop when $D$ is small; however, symmetry broken configurations do occur\nin a metastable part of the phase diagram which lies very close to the\nequilibrium bridging phase boundary.

Hence, these vehicles need a single\ncontroller referred to as Robust Simultaneously Stabilizing Decoupling (RSSD)\noutput feedback controller that achieves simultaneous stabilization, desired\ndecoupling, robustness, and performance for a finite set of unstable\nmulti-input-multi-output adversely coupled uncertain plants. To synthesize a\nRSSD output feedback controller, a new method that is based on a central plant\nis proposed in this paper. Given a finite set of plants for simultaneous\nstabilization, we considered a plant in this set that has the smallest maximum\n$v-$gap metric as the central plant. Following this, the sufficient condition\nfor the existence of a simultaneous stabilizing controller associated with such\na plant is described. The decoupling feature is then appended to this\ncontroller using the properties of the eigenstructure assignment method.\n  Afterward, the sufficient conditions for the existence of a RSSD output\nfeedback controller are obtained. Using these sufficient conditions, a new\noptimization problem for the synthesis of a RSSD output feedback controller is\nformulated. To solve this optimization problem, a new genetic algorithm based\noffline iterative algorithm is developed. The effectiveness of this iterative\nalgorithm is then demonstrated by generating a RSSD controller for a fixed-wing\nnano air vehicle. The performance of this controller is validated through\nnumerical and hardware-in-the-loop simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 14:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 15:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

Examples of interpretable\nclassification models include decision trees, rule sets, and rule lists.\nLearning such models often involves optimizing hyperparameters, which typically\nrequires substantial amounts of data and may result in relatively large models.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of learning compact yet accurate\nprobabilistic rule lists for multiclass classification. Specifically, we\npropose a novel formalization based on probabilistic rule lists and the minimum\ndescription length (MDL) principle. This results in virtually parameter-free\nmodel selection that naturally allows to trade-off model complexity with\ngoodness of fit, by which overfitting and the need for hyperparameter tuning\nare effectively avoided. Finally, we introduce the Classy algorithm, which\ngreedily finds rule lists according to the proposed criterion. We empirically\ndemonstrate that Classy selects small probabilistic rule lists that outperform\nstate-of-the-art classifiers when it comes to the combination of predictive\nperformance and interpretability. We show that Classy is insensitive to its\nonly parameter, i.e., the candidate set, and that compression on the training\nset correlates with classification performance, validating our MDL-based\nselection criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 14:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

We investigate this question in the case of quorum sensing (QS)\nbacteria, which regulate cooperative traits in response to population density.\nCooperation is modeled by the prisoner's dilemma, where individuals produce a\ncostly public good (PG) that equally benefits all members of a community\ndivided into multiple, distinct patches (multilevel selection). Cost and\nbenefit are non-linear functions of the PG production. The analysis of\nevolutionary stability yields an optimization problem for the expression of PG\nin dependency on the number of QS individuals within a colony. We find that the\noptimal total PG production of the QS population mainly depends on the shape of\nthe benefit. A graded and a switch-like response is possible, in accordance\nwith earlier results. Interestingly, at the level of the individual cell, the\nQS response is determined by the shape of the costs. All QS individuals respond\neither homogeneously if cost are a convex function of the PG production rate,\nor they respond heterogeneously with distinct ON/OFF responses if the costs are\nconcave. The latter finding is consistent with recent experimental findings,\nand contradicts the usual interpretation of QS as a mechanism to establish a\nuniform, synchronized response of a bacterial population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 14:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

These high energy particles interact\nwith the baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to\nproduce secondary leptons.

First, we find that the high/low temperature duality of\nthe 2d Ising model translates into a new self-duality formula for Wigner's\n6j-symbol from the theory of spin recoupling. Second, we focus on the duality\nbetween the large spin asymptotics of the 6j-symbol and Fisher zeros.

In this regard, fault-tolerant\ninterconnection networks and especially fault-tolerant routing methods are\ncrucial parts of these systems. Hypercube is a popular interconnection network\nthat is used in many multiprocessors. There are several suggested practices for\nfault tolerant routing in these systems. In this paper, a neural routing method\nis introduced which is named as Fault Avoidance Routing (FAR). This method\nkeeps the message as far from the faulty nodes as possible. The proposed method\nemploys the Hopfield neural network. In comparison with other neural routing\nmethods, FAR requires a small number of neurons. The simulation results show\nthat FAR has excellent performance in larger interconnection networks and\nnetworks with a high density of faulty nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 07:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

We find both similarities with and\nmajor differences from the related properties of quantum systems. Two search\nalgorithms utilizing the observed features are introduced. For the first one we\nassume an unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition\n(unknown by Bob) of up to n=2^N strings; those we call names. Bob has access to\nthe superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the INBL system of N\nnoise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the\nsuperposition, once the search has begun, it takes N switching operations\nfollowed by a single measurement of the superposition wave. Thus the time and\nhardware complexity of the search algorithm is O[log(n)] which indicates an\nexponential speedup compared to Grover's quantum algorithm in a corresponding\nsetting. An extra advantage is that the error probability of the search is\nzero. Moreover, the scheme can also check the existence of a fraction of a\nstring, or several separate string fractions embedded in an arbitrarily long,\narbitrary string. In the second algorithm, we expand the above scheme to a\nphonebook with n names and s phone numbers. When the names and numbers have the\nsame bit resolution, once the search has begun, the time and hardware\ncomplexity of this search algorithm is O[log(n)]. In the case of one-to-one\ncorrespondence between names and phone numbers (n=s), the algorithm offers\ninverse phonebook search too. The error probability of this search algorithm is\nalso zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:12:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 01:25:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 17:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Yet standard grade GPS\ndata, such as that provided by mobile phones, is often noisy and exhibits\nsignificant localization errors in many urban areas. Approaches for accurate\nlocalization from imagery often rely on structure-based techniques, and thus\nare limited in scale and are expensive to compute. In this paper, we present a\nscalable visual localization approach geared for real-time performance. We\npropose a hybrid coarse-to-fine approach that leverages visual and GPS location\ncues. Our solution uses a self-supervised approach to learn a compact road\nimage representation. This representation enables efficient visual retrieval\nand provides coarse localization cues, which are fused with vehicle ego-motion\nto obtain high accuracy location estimates. As a benchmark to evaluate the\nperformance of our visual localization approach, we introduce a new large-scale\ndriving dataset based on video and GPS data obtained from a large-scale network\nof connected dash-cams.

In order to attain certain desired return\nprofiles, quantitative strategists must determine a large array of trading\nparameters. Backtesting, the attempt to identify the appropriate parameters\nusing historical data available, has been highly criticized due to the\nabundance of misleading results. Hence, there is an increasing interest in\ndevising procedures for the assessment and comparison of strategies, that is,\ndevising schemes for preventing what is known as backtesting overfitting. So\nfar, many financial researchers have proposed different ways to tackle this\nproblem that can be broadly categorised in three types: Data Snooping,\nOverestimated Performance, and Cross-Validation Evaluation. In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to dealing with financial overfitting, a\nCovariance-Penalty Correction, in which a risk metric is lowered given the\nnumber of parameters and data used to underpins a trading strategy. We outlined\nthe foundation and main results behind the Covariance-Penalty correction for\ntrading strategies. After that, we pursue an empirical investigation, comparing\nits performance with some other approaches in the realm of Covariance-Penalties\nacross more than 1300 assets, using Ordinary and Total Least Squares. Our\nresults suggest that Covariance-Penalties are a suitable procedure to avoid\nBacktesting Overfitting, and Total Least Squares provides superior performance\nwhen compared to Ordinary Least Squares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 08:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}
