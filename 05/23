To encourage robustness, it iteratively computes adversarial examples\nfor the model, and then re-trains on these examples via some update rule. This\nwork analyzes the performance of adversarial training on linearly separable\ndata, and provides bounds on the number of iterations required for large\nmargin. We show that when the update rule is given by an arbitrary empirical\nrisk minimizer, adversarial training may require exponentially many iterations\nto obtain large margin. However, if gradient or stochastic gradient update\nrules are used, only polynomially many iterations are required to find a\nlarge-margin separator. By contrast, without the use of adversarial examples,\ngradient methods may require exponentially many iterations to achieve large\nmargin. Our results are derived by showing that adversarial training with\ngradient updates minimizes a robust version of the empirical risk at a\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\ln(t)^2/t)$ rate, despite non-smoothness. We corroborate our\ntheory empirically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

In this work, we present the Lagrangian formulation\nof the MP theory starting directly from the principle of least action and the\nwell-known Lagrangian densities of the electromagnetic field and the medium\nwithin the special theory of relativity. The Lagrangian densities and the\nresulting Euler-Lagrange equations lead directly and without any further\npostulates to the unique expression of the optical Abraham force that\ndynamically couples the electromagnetic field and the medium in the MP theory\nof light. The field-medium coupling is symmetric and bi-directional and it\nfulfills the law of action and counteraction. The coupled dynamical equations\nalso enable the exact description of the very small kinetic energy of the\nmedium as a part of the total energy of the coupled state of light.

Monitoring the conditions of these nodes is\nimportant for system management purposes, which, however, can be extremely\nresource demanding as this requires collecting local measurements of each\nindividual node and constantly sending those measurements to a central\ncontroller. Meanwhile, it is often useful to forecast the future system\nconditions for various purposes such as resource planning/allocation and\nanomaly detection, but it is usually too resource-consuming to have one\nforecasting model running for each node, which may also neglect correlations in\nobserved metrics across different nodes. In this paper, we propose a mechanism\nfor collecting and forecasting the resource utilization of machines in a\ndistributed computing system in a scalable manner. We present an algorithm that\nallows each local node to decide when to transmit its most recent measurement\nto the central node, so that the transmission frequency is kept below a given\nconstraint value. Based on the measurements received from local nodes, the\ncentral node summarizes the received data into a small number of clusters.\nSince the cluster partitioning can change over time, we also present a method\nto capture the evolution of clusters and their centroids. As an effective way\nto reduce the amount of computation, time-series forecasting models are trained\non the time-varying centroids of each cluster, to forecast the future resource\nutilizations of a group of local nodes.

Given such partial preference information, we explore the design of\nrobust deterministic mechanisms, where by robust mechanisms we mean ones that\nperform well with respect to all the possible unknown true preferred locations\nof the agents. Towards this end, we consider two well-studied objective\nfunctions and look at implementing these under two natural solution concepts\nfor our setting i) very weak dominance and ii) minimax dominance. We show that\nunder the former solution concept, there are no mechanisms that do better than\na naive mechanism which always, irrespective of the information provided by the\nagents, outputs the same location. However, when using the latter, weaker,\nsolution concept, we show that one can do significantly better, and we provide\nupper and lower bounds on the performance of mechanisms for the objective\nfunctions of interest. Furthermore, we note that our mechanisms can be viewed\nas extensions to the classical optimal mechanisms in that they perform\noptimally when agents precisely know and specify their preferred locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 16:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

At the same time, individuals may use knowledge, gained by\ntransparency, to invest effort strategically in order to maximize their chances\nof receiving a beneficial decision. Our goal is to find decision policies that\nare optimal in terms of utility in such a strategic setting. To this end, we\nfirst characterize how strategic investment of effort by individuals leads to a\nchange in the feature distribution. Using this characterization, we first show\nthat, in general, we cannot expect to find optimal decision policies in\npolynomial time and there are cases in which deterministic policies are\nsuboptimal. Then, we demonstrate that, if the cost individuals pay to change\ntheir features satisfies a natural monotonicity assumption, we can narrow down\nthe search for the optimal policy to a particular family of decision policies\nwith a set of desirable properties, which allow for a highly effective\npolynomial time heuristic search algorithm using dynamic programming.

Practically, it plays an\nimportant role for CTR modeling in these applications by mining user interest\nfrom rich historical behavior data. Driven by the development of deep learning,\ndeep CTR models with ingeniously designed architecture for user interest\nmodeling have been proposed, bringing remarkable improvement of model\nperformance over offline metric.However, great efforts are needed to deploy\nthese complex models to online serving system for realtime inference, facing\nmassive traffic request. Things turn to be more difficult when it comes to long\nsequential user behavior data, as the system latency and storage cost increase\napproximately linearly with the length of user behavior sequence. In this\npaper, we face directly the challenge of long sequential user behavior modeling\nand introduce our hands-on practice with the co-design of machine learning\nalgorithm and online serving system for CTR prediction task.

Here we overcome this difficulty by\nderiving a real-space model of atomic motion in the prototypical NTE material\nscandium trifluoride, ScF3, from total neutron scattering data. We show that\nNTE in this material depends not only on rigid unit modes - the vibrations in\nwhich the scandium coordination octahedra remain undistorted - but also on\nmodes that distort these octahedra.

While we may have samples large enough for Central Limit\nTheorem to kick in, experimentation is challenging due to the wide confidence\ninterval of estimation. We demonstrate the pressure by running A/A simulations\nwith customer spending data from a large-scale Ecommerce site. Solutions are\nthen explored. On one front we address the heavy tail directly and highlight\nthe often ignored nuances of winsorization. In particular, the legitimacy of\nfalse positive rate could be at risk. We are further inspired by the idea of\nrobust statistics and introduce Huber regression as a better way to measure\ntreatment effect. On another front covariates from pre-experiment period are\nexploited. Although they are independent to assignment and potentially explain\nthe variation of response well, concerns are that models are learned against\nprediction error rather than the bias of parameter. We find the framework of\northogonal learning useful, matching not raw observations but residuals from\ntwo predictions, one towards the response and the other towards the assignment.\nRobust regression is readily integrated, together with cross-fitting.

The creation of bipartite\nentanglement has also been reported for two-walker systems. In this scenario,\nhowever, since the global state lies in a fourpartite Hilbert space, the\nquestion arises as to whether genuine multipartite entanglement may develop in\ntime. Also, since the spatial degrees of freedom can be viewed as a noisy\nchannel for the two-spin part, one may wonder how other nonclassical aspects,\nsuch as Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, quantum discord,\nand symmetrical quantum discord, evolve in time during the walk. The lack of\nanalytical and numerical evidences which would allow one to address these\nquestions is possibly due to the usual computational difficulties associated\nwith the recursive nature of quantum walks. Here, we work around this issue by\nintroducing a simplified Gaussian model which proves to be very accurate within\na given domain and powerful for analytical studies.

Theoretical studies of switching error probability of\nmagneto-elastic switches have predicted probabilities ranging from 10E-8-10E-3\nat room temperature for ideal, defect-free nanomagnets, but experiments with\nreal nanomagnets show a much higher probability that exceeds 0.1 in some cases.\nThe obvious spoilers that can cause this large difference are defects and\nnon-idealities. Here, we have theoretically studied the effect of common\ndefects (that occur during fabrication) on magneto-elastic switching\nprobability in the presence of room-temperature thermal noise. Surprisingly, we\nfound that even small defects increase the switching error probabilities by\norders of magnitude. There is usually a critical stress that leads to the\nlowest error probability and its value increases enormously in the presence of\ndefects. All this could limit or preclude the application of magneto-elastic\n(straintronic) binary switches in either Boolean logic or memory, despite their\nexcellent energy-efficiency, and restrict them to non-Boolean (e.g.\nneuromorphic, stochastic) computing applications. We also studied the\ndifference between magneto-elastic switching with a stress pulse of constant\namplitude and sinusoidal time-varying amplitude (e.g. due to a surface acoustic\nwave) and found that the latter method is more reliable and generates lower\nswitching error probabilities in most cases, provided the time variation is\nreasonably slow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 18:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 18:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Our approach proves that some widespread beliefs about QM\ncan be questioned and establishes new links with a classical view, which is\nsignificant in the debate on the interpretations of QM. We propose here a brief\nsurvey of our results, highlighting their common background. We firstly show\nhow quantum logic (QL) can be embedded into classical logic (CL) if the\nembedding is required to preserve the logical order and not the algebraic\nstructure, and also how QL can be interpreted as a pragmatic sublanguage within\na pragmatic extension of CL. Both these results challenge the thesis that CL\nand QL formalize the properties of different and incompatible notions of truth.\nWe then show that quantum probability admits an epistemic interpretation if\ncontextuality is taken into account as a basic constituent of the language of\nQM, which overcomes the interpretation of quantum probability as ontic.\nFinally, we show that the proofs that QM is a contextual theory stand on a\nsupplementary epistemological assumption that is usually unnoticed and left\nimplicit. Dropping such assumption opens the way, at least in principle, to\nnon-contextual interpretations of QM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 18:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

In order to make imputations, we train a simple and\neffective generator network to generate imputations that a discriminator\nnetwork is tasked to distinguish. Following this, a predictor network is\ntrained using the imputed samples from the generator network to capture the\nclassification uncertainties and make predictions accordingly. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and MNIST image datasets as well as five\nreal-world tabular classification datasets, under different missingness rates\nand structures. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in generating imputations as well as providing estimates for the class\nuncertainties in a classification task when faced with missing values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 19:29:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 03:24:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 04:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

This reduction in\nreachable states leads to replanning when the agent encounters states without a\nprecomputed action during plan execution. However, not all states are suitable\nfor replanning. In the worst case, the agent may not be able to reach the goal\nfrom the newly encountered state. Agents should be better prepared to handle\nsuch risky situations and avoid replanning in risky states. Hence, we consider\nreplanning in states that are unsafe for deliberation as a negative side effect\nof planning with reduced models. While the negative side effects can be\nminimized by always using the full model, this defeats the purpose of using\nreduced models. The challenge is to plan with reduced models, but somehow\naccount for the possibility of encountering risky situations. An agent should\nthus only replan in states that the user has approved as safe for replanning.\nTo that end, we propose planning using a portfolio of reduced models, a\nplanning paradigm that minimizes the negative side effects of planning using\nreduced models by alternating between different outcome selection approaches.\nWe empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three domains:\nan electric vehicle charging domain using real-world data from a university\ncampus and two benchmark planning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 20:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

For the past four\ndecades, human decision-making under uncertainty has continued to be explained\nby theoretical models based on prospect theory, a framework that was awarded\nthe Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

While machine learning is a natural candidate for\nsolving these problems, it is currently unclear to what extent it can improve\npredictions obtained by current theories. We argue that this is mainly due to\ndata scarcity, since noisy human behavior requires massive sample sizes to be\naccurately captured by off-the-shelf machine learning methods. To solve this\nproblem, what is needed are machine learning models with appropriate inductive\nbiases for capturing human behavior, and larger datasets. We offer two\ncontributions towards this end: first, we construct \"cognitive model priors\" by\npretraining neural networks with synthetic data generated by cognitive models\n(i.e., theoretical models developed by cognitive psychologists). We find that\nfine-tuning these networks on small datasets of real human decisions results in\nunprecedented state-of-the-art improvements on two benchmark datasets. Second,\nwe present the first large-scale dataset for human decision-making, containing\nover 240,000 human judgments across over 13,000 decision problems.

In the flattened envelope, the polarization is mainly due to\nthe magnetically aligned dust grains, inferring a highly pinched poloidal field\nmorphology there. Thus, both the kinematics and field morphology support that\nthe flattened envelope is a pseudodisk formed as the infalling gas is guided by\nthe field lines to the equatorial plane.

Despite\nstate-of-the-art methods achieving strong overall accuracy, Multi-Hop (MH)\nreasoning remains particularly challenging. To address MH-QA specifically, we\npropose a Deep Reinforcement Learning based method capable of learning\nsequential reasoning across large collections of documents so as to pass a\nquery-aware, fixed-size context subset to existing models for answer\nextraction. Our method is comprised of two stages: a linker, which decomposes\nthe provided support documents into a graph of sentences, and an extractor,\nwhich learns where to look based on the current question and already-visited\nsentences. The result of the linker is a novel graph structure at the sentence\nlevel that preserves logical flow while still allowing rapid movement between\ndocuments. Importantly, we demonstrate that the sparsity of the resultant graph\nis invariant to context size. This translates to fewer decisions required from\nthe Deep-RL trained extractor, allowing the system to scale effectively to\nlarge collections of documents.\n  The importance of sequential decision making in the document traversal step\nis demonstrated by comparison to standard IE methods, and we additionally\nintroduce a BM25-based IR baseline that retrieves documents relevant to the\nquery only.

Various methods based on functional\ncausal models have been proposed to solve this problem, by assuming the causal\nprocess satisfies some (structural) constraints and showing that the reverse\ndirection violates such constraints. The nonlinear additive noise model has\nbeen demonstrated to be effective for this purpose, but the model class is not\ntransitive--even if each direct causal relation follows this model, indirect\ncausal influences, which result from omitted intermediate causal variables and\nare frequently encountered in practice, do not necessarily follow the model\nconstraints; as a consequence, the nonlinear additive noise model may fail to\ncorrectly discover causal direction.

To alleviate catastrophic\nforgetting, our method replays one sample per class from previous tasks, and\ncorrespondingly matches newly predicted embeddings to their nearest\nclass-representative prototypes stored from previous tasks. Compared with\nrecent continual learning approaches, our method can readily adapt to new tasks\nwith more classes without requiring the addition of new units. Furthermore, our\nmethod is more memory efficient since only class-representative prototypes with\ntheir means and variances, as well as only one sample per class from previous\ntasks need to be stored.

Despite the benefits of\nover-parameterization, a huge amount of parameters makes deep networks\ncumbersome in daily life applications. Though techniques such as pruning and\ndistillation are developed, they are expensive in fully training a dense\nnetwork as backward selection methods, and there is still a void on\nsystematically exploring forward selection methods for learning structural\nsparsity in deep networks. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes a new\napproach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces, which\ngenerate a family of models from simple to complex ones along the dynamics via\ncoupling a pair of parameters, such that over-parameterized deep models and\ntheir structural sparsity can be explored simultaneously. This kind of\ndifferential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, dubbed Deep\nstructure splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose global\nconvergence in learning deep networks could be established under the\nKurdyka-Lojasiewicz framework. Experimental evidence shows that our method\nachieves comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers\nin exploring the sparse structure of several widely used backbones on the\nbenchmark datasets. Remarkably, with early stopping, our method unveils\n`winning tickets' in early epochs: the effective sparse network structures with\ncomparable test accuracy to fully trained over-parameterized models, that are\nfurther transferable to similar alternative tasks.

Therefore, there\nis a critical need for compact and ultralow-power VMM blocks to perform\nresource-intensive low-to-moderate precision computations. To this end, in this\nwork, for the first time, we propose a time-domain mixed-signal VMM exploiting\na modified configuration of 1MOSFET-1RRAM (1T-1R) array. The proposed VMM\novercomes the energy inefficiency of the current-mode VMM approaches based on\nRRAMs. A rigorous analysis of the different non-ideal factors affecting the\ncomputational precision indicates that the non-negligible minimum cell\ncurrents, channel length modulation (CLM) and drain-induced barrier lowering\n(DIBL) are the dominant mechanisms degrading the precision of the proposed VMM.\nOur results also indicate that there exists a trade-off between the\ncomputational precision, dynamic range, and the area- and energy-efficiency of\nthe proposed VMM approach. Therefore, we provide the necessary design\nguidelines for optimizing the performance. Our preliminary results show that an\neffective computational precision of 6-bits is achievable owing to an inherent\ncompensation effect in the modified 1T-1R blocks.

Most tutorial ontologies focus on illustrating one aspect of\nontology development, notably language features and automated reasoners, but\nignore ontology development factors, such as emergent modelling guidelines and\nontological principles. Yet, novices replicate examples from the exercises they\ncarry out. Not providing good examples holistically causes the propagation of\nsub-optimal ontology development, which may negatively affect the quality of a\nreal domain ontology. Results. We identified 22 requirements that a good\ntutorial ontology should satisfy regarding subject domain, logics and\nreasoning, and engineering aspects. We developed a set of ontologies about\nAfrican Wildlife to serve as tutorial ontologies. A majority of the\nrequirements have been met with the set of African Wildlife Ontology tutorial\nontologies, which are introduced in this paper.

Compare to random-mutation-based\nfuzzing, concolic execution is especially good at exploring paths that are\nguarded by complex and tight branch predicates (e.g., (a*b) == 0xdeadbeef). The\ndrawback, however, is that concolic execution engines are much slower than\nnative execution. One major source of the slowness is that concolic execution\nengines have to the interpret instructions to maintain the symbolic expression\nof program variables. In this work, we propose SynFuzz, a novel approach to\nperform scalable concolic execution. SynFuzz achieves this goal by replacing\ninterpretation with dynamic taint analysis and program synthesis. In\nparticular, to flip a conditional branch, SynFuzz first uses operation-aware\ntaint analysis to record a partial expression (i.e., a sketch) of its branch\npredicate. Then it uses oracle-guided program synthesis to reconstruct the\nsymbolic expression based on input-output pairs. The last step is the same as\ntraditional concolic execution - SynFuzz consults a SMT solver to generate an\ninput that can flip the target branch. By doing so, SynFuzz can achieve an\nexecution speed that is close to fuzzing while retain concolic execution's\ncapability of flipping complex branch predicates. We have implemented a\nprototype of SynFuzz and evaluated it with three sets of programs: real-world\napplications, the LAVA-M benchmark, and the Google Fuzzer Test Suite (FTS). The\nevaluation results showed that SynFuzz was much more scalable than traditional\nconcolic execution engines, was able to find more bugs in LAVA-M than most\nstate-of-the-art concolic execution engine (QSYM), and achieved better code\ncoverage on real-world applications and FTS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 08:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

The presence of two\nX-ray blobs illuminating an accretion disc can cause the interference between\ntwo reprocessing-echo components and produce distinct physical features in the\nPSD. The oscillatory structures (e.g., dips and humps) are seen but, contrarily\nto the lamp-post case, the strongest dip is not always the one at the lowest\nfrequency. Instead, we find the frequency where the strongest dip is seen\nassociates to the lower-source height while the lowest frequency where the\nfirst dip appears links with the upper-source height. This is because the\nreverberation timescales increase with the source height. Accurate modelling of\nthe PSD then helps put constraints to the lower and upper limit of the corona\nextent. Furthermore, the reverberation signatures are less pronounced with\nincreasing number of sources that do not produce reflection (e.g., additional\nX-rays from fast, relativistic outflows). The amplitude of the oscillations\nalso depends on the amount of dilution contributed by the X-ray sources, thus\nencodes information about their relative brightness. Due to stronger dilutions,\nrobust detection of these signatures with the current observations will become\neven more difficult if the corona is extended. Future observations made by\nAthena will enable us to fit these characteristics in statistically significant\ndetails, and to reveal the nature of the disc-corona system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 09:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

This paper proposes a framework for prescriptive process monitoring,\nwhich extends predictive monitoring with the ability to generate alarms that\ntrigger interventions to prevent an undesired outcome or mitigate its effect.\nThe framework incorporates a parameterized cost model to assess the\ncost-benefit trade-off of generating alarms. We show how to optimize the\ngeneration of alarms given an event log of past process executions and a set of\ncost model parameters. The proposed approaches are empirically evaluated using\na range of real-life event logs. The experimental results show that the net\ncost of undesired outcomes can be minimized by changing the threshold for\ngenerating alarms, as the process instance progresses. Moreover, introducing\ndelays for triggering alarms, instead of triggering them as soon as the\nprobability of an undesired outcome exceeds a threshold, leads to lower net\ncosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 10:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 12:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

The size of the shared sub-structure is tunned by varying the\nchemical affinity $\\nu$ such that for significant positive $\\nu$ sharing the\nlargest face is the most probable, while for $\\nu < 0$, attaching via a single\nnode dominates. Our results reveal that, while the parameter of hyperbolicity\nremains $\\delta_{max}=1$ across the assemblies, their structure and spectral\ndimension $d_s$ vary with the size of cliques $n$ and the affinity when $\\nu\n\\geq 0$.

The back tests of the 2015 Chinese stock market bubbles\nindicates that the LPPLS model can readily detect the bubble behavior of the\nfaster-than-exponential increase corrected by the accelerating\nlogarithm-periodic oscillations in the 2015 Chinese Stock market. The existence\nof log-periodicity is detected by applying the Lomb spectral analysis on the\ndetrended residuals.

Basis\npursuit denoising (BPD) performs noise reduction in this way. However, the\nshortcoming of using L1 norm regularization is the underestimation of the true\nsolution. Recently, a class of non-convex penalties have been proposed to\nimprove this situation. This kind of penalty function is non-convex itself, but\npreserves the convexity property of the whole cost function. This approach has\nbeen confirmed to offer good performance in 1-D signal denoising. This paper\ndemonstrates the aforementioned method to 2-D signals (images) and applies it\nto multisensor image fusion. The problem is posed as an inverse one and a\ncorresponding cost function is judiciously designed to include two data\nattachment terms. The whole cost function is proved to be convex upon suitably\nchoosing the non-convex penalty, so that the cost function minimization can be\ntackled by convex optimization approaches, which comprise simple computations.\nThe performance of the proposed method is benchmarked against a number of\nstate-of-the-art image fusion techniques and superior performance is\ndemonstrated both visually and in terms of various assessment measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 13:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 18:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

In this paper, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to\ntrain reinforcement learning agents for evacuation planning.

Symbolic action\nplanning is useful to resolve causal dependencies and to break a causally\ncomplex problem down into a sequence of simpler high-level actions. A problem\nwith the integration of both approaches is that action planning is based on\ndiscrete high-level action- and state spaces, whereas reinforcement learning is\nusually driven by a continuous reward function. However, recent advances in\nreinforcement learning, specifically, universal value function approximators\nand hindsight experience replay, have focused on goal-independent methods based\non sparse rewards. In this article, we build on these novel methods to\nfacilitate the integration of action planning with reinforcement learning by\nexploiting the reward-sparsity as a bridge between the high-level and low-level\nstate- and control spaces.

The recent Tsetlin Machine (TM)\nattempts to address this lack by using easy-to-interpret conjunctive clauses in\npropositional logic to solve complex pattern recognition problems. The TM\nprovides competitive accuracy in several benchmarks, while keeping the\nimportant property of interpretability. It further facilitates hardware-near\nimplementation since inputs, patterns, and outputs are expressed as bits, while\nrecognition and learning rely on straightforward bit manipulation. In this\npaper, we exploit the TM paradigm by introducing the Convolutional Tsetlin\nMachine (CTM), as an interpretable alternative to CNNs. Whereas the TM\ncategorizes an image by employing each clause once to the whole image, the CTM\nuses each clause as a convolution filter. That is, a clause is evaluated\nmultiple times, once per image patch taking part in the convolution. To make\nthe clauses location-aware, each patch is further augmented with its\ncoordinates within the image. The output of a convolution clause is obtained\nsimply by ORing the outcome of evaluating the clause on each patch. In the\nlearning phase of the TM, clauses that evaluate to 1 are contrasted against the\ninput. For the CTM, we instead contrast against one of the patches, randomly\nselected among the patches that made the clause evaluate to 1. Accordingly, the\nstandard Type I and Type II feedback of the classic TM can be employed\ndirectly, without further modification. The CTM obtains a peak test accuracy of\n99.4% on MNIST, 96.31% on Kuzushiji-MNIST, 91.5% on Fashion-MNIST, and 100.0%\non the 2D Noisy XOR Problem, which is competitive with results reported for\nsimple 4-layer CNNs, BinaryConnect, Logistic Circuits and an FPGA-accelerated\nBinary CNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 14:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 06:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 16:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 01:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 11:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

These breakthroughs pave the way for\nquantum information processing that combines the long coherence times of\nsolid-state spin qubits with the long-distance connectivity, fast control, and\nfast high-fidelity quantum-non-demolition readout of existing superconducting\nqubit implementations. Here, we theoretically analyze and optimize the\ndispersive readout of a single spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD)\ncoupled to a microwave resonator via its electric dipole moment. The strong\nspin-photon coupling arises from the motion of the electron spin in a local\nmagnetic field gradient. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the\nreadout accounting for both Purcell spin relaxation and spin relaxation arising\nfrom intrinsic electric noise within the semiconductor. We express the maximum\nachievable SNR in terms of the cooperativity associated with these two\ndissipation processes. We find that while the cooperativity increases with the\nstrength of the dipole coupling between the DQD and the resonator, it does not\ndepend on the strength of the magnetic field gradient. We then optimize the SNR\nas a function of experimentally tunable DQD parameters. We identify wide\nregions of parameter space where the unwanted backaction of the resonator\nphotons on the qubit is small. Moreover, we find that the coupling of the\nresonator to other DQD transitions can enhance the SNR by at least a factor of\ntwo, a ``straddling'' effect that occurs only at nonzero energy detuning of the\nDQD double-well potential.

The\nfeature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments\n(generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the\nprobability distribution.The loss can be back-propagated not only to the\nnetwork weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune\nthe size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise\ninterpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in\nthe aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each\ndistribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose\nparameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation,\nfrom the original networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our new perspective of network pruning\ncompared to traditional network pruning algorithms. Various searching and\nknowledge transfer approaches are conducted to show the effectiveness of the\ntwo components.

Most of the existing meta-learning\nmethods are proposed to tackle few-shot learning problems such as image and\ntext, in rather Euclidean domain. However, there are very few works applying\nmeta-learning to non-Euclidean domains, and the recently proposed graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) models do not perform effectively on graph few-shot learning\nproblems. Towards this, we propose a novel graph meta-learning framework --\nMeta-GNN -- to tackle the few-shot node classification problem in graph\nmeta-learning settings. It obtains the prior knowledge of classifiers by\ntraining on many similar few-shot learning tasks and then classifies the nodes\nfrom new classes with only few labeled samples. Additionally, Meta-GNN is a\ngeneral model that can be straightforwardly incorporated into any existing\nstate-of-the-art GNN. Our experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach not only improves the node\nclassification performance by a large margin on few-shot learning problems in\nmeta-learning paradigm, but also learns a more general and flexible model for\ntask adaption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 15:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

In this paper, we make use of the phaseless near-field data\nincurred by the cavity and the point sources, and thus the configuration is\nmore feasible in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 03:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

It is used to\ndefine two imaging progression markers: 1) a morphological age and 2) a disease\nscore. These markers can be computed locally in any brain region. The approach\nis evaluated on brain structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the ADNI\ndatabase. The generative model is first estimated on a control population,\nthen, for each subject, the markers are computed for each acquisition. The\nlongitudinal evolution of these markers is then studied in relation with the\nclinical diagnosis of the subjects and used to generate possible morphological\nevolution. In the model, the morphological changes associated with normal aging\nare mainly found around the ventricles, while the Alzheimer's disease specific\nchanges are more located in the temporal lobe and the hippocampal area. The\nstatistical analysis of these markers highlights differences between clinical\nconditions even though the inter-subject variability is quiet high. In this\ncontext, the model can be used to generate plausible morphological trajectories\nassociated with the disease. Our method gives two interpretable scalar imaging\nbiomarkers assessing the effects of aging and disease on brain morphology at\nthe individual and population level.

The proposed scheme builds on the classical fuzzy\nvault by adding the concept of uncertainty and imprecision to the classical\nscheme. To lock a secret key K in the classical fuzzy vault the locking and\nunlocking elements are crisp or real elements and consequently the locking and\nunlocking operations are strict imperative. In the fuzzy-fuzzy vault scheme,\nAlice locks the secret key K using a set of fuzzy elements that belong to\nmulti-fuzzy set A~ obtained from a universe public set of fuzzy elements in a\nmulti-fuzzy set F~_q and projecting them on polynomial p. The elements in\nmulti-fuzzy sets F~_q and A~ are fuzzy using m membership functions MF_i,\ni=1,2,...,m. Alice selects a set k of fuzzy elements fuzzy with a specific\nmembership function MF_K from A~ to lock the vault. To hide the genuine locking\npoints Alice generates a set of fuzzy chaff points that some of them do not lie\non polynomial p while the other fuzzy chaff points may lie on polynomial p but\nfuzzy with different membership functions other than the membership function\nMF_K used to lock the vault. To unlock the fuzzy-fuzzy vault and retrieve the\nsecret key K , Bob should have a set of unlocking fuzzy elements belonging to\nmulti-fuzzy set B~ which substantially overlap with A~ is required. Then Bob\nselects t'_(TF_ki) fuzzy elements from B~ which are close to the t_(TF_k) fuzzy\nelements from A~ used by Alice to lock the vault. We show that adding\nuncertainty and imprecision by introducing fuzzy theory will enhance the\nsecurity threshold of the fuzzy vault.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 11:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

Generics in Java, however, include some features---such as Java\nwildcards, $F$-bounded generics, and Java erasure---that have been hard to\nanalyze and reason about so far, reflecting the fact that the mathematical\nmodeling of generics in Java and other similar nominally-typed object-oriented\nprogramming (OOP) languages is a challenge. As a result, the type systems of\nmainstream nominally-typed OOP languages, which are built based on current\nmodels of generics, are overly complex, which hinders the progress of these\ntype systems.\n  In this paper we present a detailed outline of a new approach to modeling\nJava generics that uses concepts and tools from order theory, and we report on\nour progress in developing this approach. Fundamentally, we use the nominal\nsubclassing relation (as a partial order) together with some standard and novel\norder-theoretic tools to construct the generic nominal subtyping relation (as a\npartial order) and the containment relation between generic type arguments (a\nthird partial order). We further analyze the relation between these three\nordering relations---which lie at the heart of mainstream generic OO type\nsystems---using order theoretic tools, and accordingly we explore extensions of\nOO type systems suggested by such analysis. In our approach we also make use of\nsome concepts and tools from category theory. We believe a combined\norder-theoretic and category-theoretic approach to modeling generics holds the\nkeys to overcoming much of the adversity found when analyzing features of\ngeneric OO type systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 11:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

The problem of optimizing an artificial neural network is\ntreated as a physical system, composed of a conservative vector force field.\nThe derived scalar potential is a measure of the potential energy of the\nnetwork, a function of the distance between predictions and targets.\n  Starting from some analogies with wave mechanics, the description of the\nsystem is justified with an eigenvalue equation that is a variant of the\nSchr\\~odinger equation, in which the potential is defined by the mutual\ninformation between inputs and targets. The weights and parameters of the\nnetwork, as well as those of the state function, are varied so as to minimize\nenergy, using an equivalent of the variational theorem of wave mechanics. The\nminimum energy thus obtained implies the principle of minimum mutual\ninformation (MinMI). We also propose a definition of the potential work\nproduced by the force field to bring a network from an arbitrary probability\ndistribution to the potential-constrained system, which allows to establish a\nmeasure of the complexity of the system. At the end of the discussion we expose\na recursive procedure that allows to refine the state function and bypass some\ninitial assumptions, as well as a discussion of some topics in quantum\nmechanics applied to the formalism, such as the uncertainty principle and the\ntemporal evolution of the system.\n  Results demonstrate how the minimization of energy effectively leads to a\ndecrease in the average error between network predictions and targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 21:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 13:35:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 21:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}
