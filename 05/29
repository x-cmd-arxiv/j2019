Unlike prior methods that focus on detecting low-level artifacts\ngenerated during the manipulation process, we use an image retrieval approach\nto tackle this problem. When given a spliced query image, our goal is to\nretrieve the original image from a database of authentic images. To achieve\nthis goal, we propose representing an image by its constituent objects based on\nthe intuition that the finest granularity of manipulations is oftentimes at the\nobject-level. We introduce a framework, object embeddings for spliced image\nretrieval (OE-SIR), that utilizes modern object detectors to localize object\nregions. Each region is then embedded and collectively used to represent the\nimage. Further, we propose a student-teacher training paradigm for learning\ndiscriminative embeddings within object regions to avoid expensive multiple\nforward passes. Detailed analysis of the efficacy of different feature\nembedding models is also provided in this study.

Unfortunately,\ncommon paper matching algorithms often construct matchings suffering from two\ncritical problems: (1) the group of reviewers assigned to a paper do not\ncollectively possess sufficient expertise, and (2) reviewer workloads are\nhighly skewed. In this paper, we propose a novel local fairness formulation of\npaper matching that directly addresses both of these issues. Since optimizing\nour formulation is not always tractable, we introduce two new algorithms,\nFairIR and FairFlow, for computing fair matchings that approximately optimize\nthe new formulation. FairIR solves a relaxation of the local fairness\nformulation and then employs a rounding technique to construct a valid matching\nthat provably maximizes the objective and only compromises on fairness with\nrespect to reviewer loads and papers by a small constant. In contrast, FairFlow\nis not provably guaranteed to produce fair matchings, however it can be 2x as\nefficient as FairIR and an order of magnitude faster than matching algorithms\nthat directly optimize for fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that both\nFairIR and FairFlow improve fairness over standard matching algorithms on real\nconference data. Moreover, in comparison to state-of-the-art matching\nalgorithms that optimize for fairness only, FairIR achieves higher objective\nscores, FairFlow achieves competitive fairness, and both are capable of more\nevenly allocating reviewers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 16:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

The process of accurately diagnosing a\nbiopsy sample requires significant expertise in the field, and as such can be\ntime-consuming and is prone to uncertainty and error. With the advent of\ndigital pathology, using image recognition systems to highlight problem areas\nor locate similar images can aid pathologists in making quick and accurate\ndiagnoses. In this paper, we specifically consider the encoded local\nprojections (ELP) algorithm, which has previously shown some success as a tool\nfor classification and recognition of histopathology images. We build on the\nsuccess of the ELP algorithm as a means for image classification and\nrecognition by proposing a modified algorithm which captures the local\nfrequency information of the image. The proposed algorithm estimates local\nfrequencies by quantifying the changes in multiple projections in local windows\nof greyscale images. By doing so we remove the need to store the full\nprojections, thus significantly reducing the histogram size, and decreasing\ncomputation time for image retrieval and classification tasks. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of applying our method to histopathology images\nwhich have been digitally separated into their hematoxylin and eosin stain\ncomponents. The proposed algorithm is tested on the publicly available invasive\nductal carcinoma (IDC) data set. The histograms are used to train an SVM to\nclassify the data.

Band ODs model the semantics of attributes that\nare monotonically related with small variations without there being an\nintrinsic violation of semantics. The class of abcODs generalizes band ODs to\nmake them more relevant to real-world applications by relaxing them to hold\napproximately (abODs) with some exceptions and conditionally (bcODs) on subsets\nof the data. We study the problem of automatic dependency discovery over a\nhierarchy of abcODs. First, we propose a more efficient algorithm to discover\nabODs than in recent prior work. The algorithm is based on a new optimization\nto compute a longest monotonic band (longest subsequence of tuples that satisfy\na band OD) through dynamic programming by decreasing the runtime from O(n^2) to\nO(n \\log n) time. We then illustrate that while the discovery of bcODs is\nrelatively straightforward, there exist codependencies between approximation\nand conditioning that make the problem of abcOD discovery challenging. The\nnaive solution is prohibitively expensive as it considers all possible\nsegmentations of tuples resulting in exponential time complexity. To reduce the\nsearch space, we devise a dynamic programming algorithm for abcOD discovery\nthat determines the optimal solution in O(n^3 \\log n) complexity. To further\noptimize the performance, we adapt the algorithm to cheaply identify\nconsecutive tuples that are guaranteed to belong to the same band--this\nimproves the performance significantly in practice without losing optimality.\nWhile unidirectional abcODs are most common in practice, for generality we\nextend our algorithms with both ascending and descending orders to discover\nbidirectional abcODs.

It has applications in the organization of\ncommercial and personal music collections. Often, music tracks are described as\na set of timbre-inspired sound textures. In shallow-learning systems, the total\nnumber of sound textures per track is usually too high, and texture\ndownsampling is necessary to make training tractable. Although previous work\nhas solved this by linear downsampling, no extensive work has been done to\nevaluate how texture selection benefits genre classification in the context of\nthe bag of frames track descriptions. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of\nframe selection on automatic music genre classification in a bag of frames\nscenario. We also present a novel texture selector based on K-Means aimed to\nidentify diverse sound textures within each track. We evaluated texture\nselection in diverse datasets, four different feature sets, as well as its\nrelationship to a univariate feature selection strategy. The results show that\nframe selection leads to significant improvement over the single vector\nbaseline on datasets consisting of full-length tracks, regardless of the\nfeature set. Results also indicate that the K-Means texture selector achieves\nsignificant improvements over the baseline, using fewer textures per track than\nthe commonly used linear downsampling. The results also suggest that texture\nselection is complementary to the feature selection strategy evaluated. Our\nqualitative analysis indicates that texture variety within classes benefits\nmodel generalization. Our analysis shows that selecting specific audio excerpts\ncan improve classification performance, and it can be done automatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 17:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

Our proposed method mitigates the latent\nvacancy problem and achieves the first success in unsupervised learning of\ncontrollable representations for text. Empirically, our method outperforms\nunsupervised baselines and strong supervised approaches on text style transfer,\nand is capable of performing more flexible fine-grained control over text\ngeneration than existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 17:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 02:47:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 21:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 17:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

The recent detection of $r$-process\nelements in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies and the abundances measured in\nclassical dwarfs challenges the NSB merger scenario both in terms of\ncoalescence time scales and merger locations. In this paper, we focus on the\ndynamics of NSBs in the gravitational potentials of different types of host\ngalaxies and on its impact on the subsequent galactic enrichment. We find that,\nfor a $\\sim t^{-1}$ delay time distribution, even when receiving a low kick\n($\\sim 10~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$) from the second supernova explosion, in shallow\ndwarf galaxy potentials NSBs tend to merge with a large off-set from the host\ngalaxy. This results in a significant geometrical dilution of the amount of\nproduced $r-$process elements that fall back and pollute the host galaxy gas\nreservoir. The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a\nlarge scatter in the expected $r$-process enrichment within a single UFD or\nclassical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium\nabundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic\nparameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the\nneed of additional $r$-process production sites that suffer less severe\ndilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 18:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 12:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

However, as one\nconsiders a growing number of continuous features, a curse of dimensionality\napplies making asymptotically valid inference impossible (Abadie and Imbens,\n2006). The alternative of ignoring plausibly relevant features is certainly no\nbetter, and the resulting trade-off substantially limits the application of\nmatching methods to \"wide\" datasets. Instead, Li and Fu (2017) recasts the\nproblem of matching in a metric learning framework that maps features to a\nlow-dimensional space that facilitates \"closer matches\" while still capturing\nimportant aspects of unit-level heterogeneity. However, that method lacks key\ntheoretical guarantees and can produce inconsistent estimates in cases of\nheterogeneous treatment effects.

We find that the atomic\nnonaffinity can efficiently characterize the locations of the shear\ntransformation zones, with a predicative capacity comparable to the best\nindicators. More importantly, the atomic nonaffinity, combining the sign of\nthird order derivative of energy with respect to coordinates, reveals an\nintrinsic softest shear orientation. By analyzing the angle between this\norientation and the shear loading direction, it is possible to predict the\nprotocol-dependent response of plastic events. Employing the new method, the\ndistribution of orientations of shear transformation zones in a model\ntwo-dimensional amorphous solids can be measured. The resulting plastic events\ncan be understood from a simple model of independent plastic events occurring\nat variously oriented shear transformation zones.

This challenge is addressed by a new optimizer, called\nexplorative gradient method (EGM). EGM alternatively performs one exploitive\ndownhill simplex step and an explorative Latin hypercube sampling iteration.\nThus, the convergence rate of a gradient based method is guaranteed while, at\nthe same time, better minima are explored. For an analytical multi-modal test\nfunction, EGM is shown to significantly outperform the downhill simplex method,\nthe random restart variant, Latin hypercube sampling, Monte Carlo iterations\nand the genetic algorithm. EGM is applied to minimize the net drag power of the\ntwo-dimensional fluidic pinball benchmark with three cylinder rotations as\nactuation parameters. The net drag power is reduced by $40\\%$ employing direct\nnumerical simulations at a Reynolds number of $100$ based on the cylinder\ndiameter. This optimal actuation leads to $98\\%$ drag reduction employing\nCoanda forcing for boat tailing and partial stabilization of vortex shedding.\nThe price is an actuation energy corresponding to $58\\%$ of the unforced\nparasitic drag power. EGM is also used to minimize drag of the $35^\\circ$\nslanted Ahmed body employing distributed steady blowing with 10 inputs. $17\\%$\ndrag reduction are achieved using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations\n(RANS) at the Reynolds number $Re_H=1.9 \\times 10^5$ based on the height of the\nAhmed body.

A stronger condition, called strong linearizability\nhas been proposed, but its study has been somewhat ad-hoc. This paper\ninvestigates strong linearizability by casting it in the context of\nobservational refinement of objects. We present a strengthening of\nobservational refinement, which generalizes strong linearizability, obtaining\nseveral important implications.\n  When a concrete concurrent object refining another, more abstract object -\noften sequential - the correctness of a program employing the concrete object\ncan be verified by considering its behaviors when using the more abstract\nobject. This means that trace properties of a program using the concrete object\ncan be proved by considering the program with the abstract object. This,\nhowever, does not hold for hyperproperties, including many security properties\nand probability distributions of events.\n  We define strong observational refinement, a strengthening of refinement that\npreserves hyperproperties, and prove that it is equivalent to the existence of\nforward simulations. We show that strong observational refinement generalizes\nstrong linearizability. This implies that strong linearizability is also\nequivalent to forward simulation, and shows that strongly linearizable\nimplementations can be composed both horizontally (i.e., locality) and\nvertically (i.e., with instantiation).\n  For situations where strongly linearizable implementations do not exist (or\nare less efficient), we argue that reasoning about hyperproperties of programs\ncan be simplified by strong observational refinement of abstract objects that\nare not necessarily sequential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 20:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

They arise as the combination of\ntwo physical processes: a driving force $f(u)$ that depends on the state\nvariable $u$ and a diffusive mechanism that spreads this effect over a spatial\ndomain. The canonical form is $u_t - \\triangle u = f(u)$. Application areas\ninclude chemical processes, heat flow models and population dynamics. The\ndirect or forwards problem for such equations is now very well-developed and\nunderstood. However, our interest lies in the inverse problem of recovering the\nreaction term $f(u)$ not just at the level of determining a few parameters in a\nknown functional form, but recovering the complete functional form itself. To\nachieve this we set up the usual paradigm for the parabolic equation where $u$\nis subject to both given initial and boundary data, then prescribe overposed\ndata consisting of the solution at a later time $T$. For example, in the case\nof a population model this amounts to census data at a fixed time. Our approach\nwill be two-fold.First we will transform the inverse problem into an equivalent\nnonlinear mapping from which we seek a fixed point. We will be able to prove\nimportant features of this map such as a self-mapping property and give\nconditions under which it is contractive. Second, we consider the direct map\nfrom $f$ through the partial differential operator to the overposed data. We\nwill investigate Newton schemes for this case.

While a variety of measurement\nstrategies have been developed to characterize how well the system is\ninitialized, for a given one, there is in general a trade-off between its\nefficiency and the accessible information of the quantum state. Conventional\nquantum state tomography can characterize unknown states by reconstructing the\ndensity matrix; however, its exponentially expensive postprocessing is likely\nto produce a deviate result. Alternatively, quantum state verification provides\na technique to quantify the prepared state with significantly fewer\nmeasurements, especially for quantum entangled states.

However, current\npopular decomposition algorithms generally require to sample and evaluate a\nlarge number of solutions for interdependency detection, which is very\ntime-consuming. To address this issue, this study proposes a new decomposition\nalgorithm named fast differential grouping (FDG). FDG first identifies the type\nof an instance by detecting the interdependencies of a few pairs of variable\nsubsets selected according to certain rules, and thus can rapidly complete the\ndecomposition of a fully separable or nonseparable instance. For an identified\npartially separable instance, FDG converts the key decomposition process into a\nsearch process in a binary tree by taking corresponding variable subsets as\ntree nodes. This enables it to directly deduce the interdependency related to a\nchild node by reutilizing the solutions sampled for corresponding parent and\nbrother nodes. To support the above operations, this study designs a normalized\nvariable-subset-oriented interdependency indicator, which can adaptively\ngenerate decomposition thresholds according to its distribution and thus\nenhances decomposition accuracy. Computational complexity analysis and\nexperimental results verify that FDG outperforms popular decomposition\nalgorithms. Further tests indicate that FDG embedded in a cooperative\nco-evolution framework can achieve highly competitive optimization results as\ncompared with some state-of-the-art algorithms for large scale black-box\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 03:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

As the model posterior is\nalmost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate\napproximation the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model\nposterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the\npredictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is\nto use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large\nnumber of samples, evaluate the model repeatedly and average multiple model\noutputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this\nwork, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained,\nwe propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability\ndistribution induced by model posterior with a parameterized model and in an\namortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the true uncertainty of a specific\nBayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at\ntesting time.

A popular\nrelaxation of the problem is the one-parameter family called the entropic cost\nproblem. The entropic cost $K_h$, $h>0$, is significantly faster to compute and\n$h K_h$ is known to converge to the optimal transport cost as $h$ goes to zero.\nWe are interested the rate of convergence. We show that the difference between\n$K_h$ and $1/h$ times the optimal cost of transport has a pointwise limit when\ntransporting a compactly supported density to another that satisfies a few\nother technical restrictions. This limit is the relative entropy of $\\rho_1$\nwith respect to a Riemannian volume measure on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ that measures the\nlocal sensitivity of the transport map.

The processes lower the free energy below the mean-field\nHartree--Fock--Bogoliubov's value in the same way as a previous\nzero-temperature formalism. From our numerical results, the pair creation or\nannihilation processes neglected in the Popov--Shohno approximation are\nenhanced, particularly in the long wavelength region, owing to the many-body\neffects. Because the 3/2-body correlations give a finite contribution to the\nself-energy of quasiparticles, they may change the microscopic properties\nqualitatively, even in the weak-coupling region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 04:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

We\nmeasure information in a neural network via the optimal trade-off between\naccuracy of the response and complexity of the weights, measured by their\ncoding length. Depending on the choice of code, the definition can reduce to\nstandard measures such as Shannon Mutual Information and Fisher Information.\nHowever, the more general definition allows us to relate information to\ngeneralization and invariance, through a novel notion of effective information\nin the activations of a deep network.

Empirical study validates the above\nstatements and shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior\ninstance-level and comparative bag-level performance, compared to\nstate-of-the-art MIL methods. In addition, it shows that the proposed method\ncan achieve similar results as the fully supervised model (trained with\ninstance labels) for label prediction at the instance level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 05:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

Recently the two dimensional transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) owing to their large exciton binding energies,\noscillator strength and valley degree of freedom have emerged as a very\nattractive platform to realize exciton-polaritons at elevated temperatures.\nAchieving electrical injection of polaritons is attractive both as a precursor\nto realizing electrically driven polariton lasers as well as for high speed\nlight-emitting diodes (LED) for communication systems. Here we demonstrate an\nelectrically driven polariton LED operating at room temperature using monolayer\ntungsten disulphide (WS2) as the emissive material. To realize this device, the\nmonolayer WS2 is sandwiched between thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel\nbarriers with graphene layers acting as the electrodes.

In this paper, we mainly discuss the issue of\npropagating labels in kernel space. A Kernel-Induced Label Propagation\n(Kernel-LP) framework by mapping is proposed for high-dimensional data\nclassification using the most informative patterns of data in kernel space. The\nessence of Kernel-LP is to perform joint label propagation and adaptive weight\nlearning in a transformed kernel space. That is, our Kernel-LP changes the task\nof label propagation from the commonly-used Euclidean space in most existing\nwork to kernel space. The motivation of our Kernel-LP to propagate labels and\nlearn the adaptive weights jointly by the assumption of an inner product space\nof inputs, i.e., the original linearly inseparable inputs may be mapped to be\nseparable in kernel space. Kernel-LP is based on existing positive and negative\nLP model, i.e., the effects of negative label information are integrated to\nimprove the label prediction power. Also, Kernel-LP performs adaptive weight\nconstruction over the same kernel space, so it can avoid the tricky process of\nchoosing the optimal neighborhood size suffered in traditional criteria. Two\nnovel and efficient out-of-sample approaches for our Kernel-LP to involve new\ntest data are also presented, i.e., (1) direct kernel mapping and (2) kernel\nmapping-induced label reconstruction, both of which purely depend on the kernel\nmatrix between training set and testing set.

In this paper, we specifically study the\nbreakup mechanism of an evaporating contact-free (acoustic levitation) emulsion\ndroplet (water-oil) under external heating. Three distinct regimes are observed\nduring the lifespan of the evaporating droplet. Initially, the droplet diameter\nregresses linearly with time, followed by vapor bubble nucleation due to a\nsignificant difference in the boiling temperature among the components of the\nemulsion. The collapse of this bubble results in a high-intensity breakup of\nthe droplet leading to the propulsion of residual liquid in the form of a\ncrown-like sheet. The area of the expanding crown varies linearly with the\nsquare of the time. It is hypothesized that the expansion of the liquid sheet\ncentrifuges the larger water sub-droplets towards the edge, resulting in unique\nspatial segregation.

The Lifshitz phase transition is accompanied by a\nsignificant growth of local magnetic moments and emergence of strong\norbital-selective correlations. It is seen as a pronounced anomaly (`kink') in\nthe total energies upon expansion of the lattice, associated with a remarkable\nenhancement of compressibility.

In this\npaper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Built upon the Generative Adversarial\nImitation Learning, AGAIL has three components: a generator, a discriminator,\nand a guide. The generator learns a policy with rewards provided by the\ndiscriminator, which tries to distinguish state distributions between\ndemonstrations and samples generated by the policy. The guide provides\nadditional rewards to the generator when demonstrated actions for specific\nstates are available.

Although the blockchain\nconsensus mechanism approaches ACID compliance, use cases that rely on frequent\nstate changes are impractical due to the block publishing interval of $O(10^1)$\nseconds. The effective isolation level is Read-Committed, only revealing state\ntransitions at the end of the block interval. Values read may be stale and not\nmatch program order, causing many transactions to fail when a block is\ncommitted. This paper perceives the blockchain as a transactional data\nstructure, using this analogy in the development of a new algorithm,\nHash-Mark-Set (HMS), that improves transaction throughput by providing a\nRead-Uncommitted view of state variables. HMS creates a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG) from the pending transaction pool.

The gold\nstandard for detecting seizures is based on visual inspection of continuous\nelectroencephalogram (cEEG) complemented by video analysis, performed by an\nexpert clinical neurophysiologist. Previous studies have reported varying\ndegree of agreement between expert EEG readers, with kappa coefficients ranging\nfrom 0.4 to 0.85, calling into question the validity of visual scoring. This\nvariability in visual scoring of neonatal seizures may be due to factors such\nas reader expertise and the nature of expressed patterns.

One way to develop this is to\nuse a shared multi-center neonatal seizure database and use the inputs from\nmultiple experts.

In this paper, we investigate the long-term carbon cycle for\nthese planets throughout their evolution. Methods: We built box models of the\nlong-term carbon cycle based on CO$_2$ degassing, seafloor-weathering,\nmetamorphic decarbonation, and ingassing and coupled them with thermal\nevolution models of stagnant lid and plate tectonics planets. Results: The\nassumed relationship between the seafloor-weathering rate and the atmospheric\nCO$_2$ or the surface temperature strongly influences the climate evolution for\nboth tectonic regimes. For a plate tectonics planet, the atmospheric CO$_2$\npartial pressure is characterised by an equilibrium between ingassing and\ndegassing and depends on the temperature gradient in subduction zones affecting\nthe stability of carbonates. For a stagnant lid planet, partial melting and\ndegassing are always accompanied by decarbonation, such that the combined\ncarbon content of the crust and atmosphere increases with time. Whereas the\ninitial mantle temperature for plate tectonics planets only affects the early\nevolution, it influences the evolution of the surface temperature of stagnant\nlid planets for much longer. Conclusions: For both tectonic regimes, mantle\ncooling results in a decreasing atmospheric CO$_2$ partial pressure. For a\nplate tectonics planet this is caused by an increasing fraction of subduction\nzones that avoid crustal decarbonation, and for stagnant lid planets this is\ncaused by an increasing decarbonation depth. This mechanism may partly\ncompensate for the increase of the surface temperature due to increasing solar\nluminosity with time and hereby contribute to keep planets habitable in the\nlong-term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 13:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Introduction of DM inside NS softens the equation of state. We explored\nthe effect of variation of DM mass and DM Fermi momentum on the NS EOS.\nMoreover, DM-Higgs coupling is constrained using dark matter direct detection\nexperiments. Then, we studied cooling of normal NSs using APR and DD2 EOSs and\nDM admixed NSs using dark-matter modified DD2 with varying DM mass and Fermi\nmomentum. We have done our analysis by considering different NS masses. Also DM\nmass and DM Fermi momentum are varied for fixed NS mass and DM-Higgs coupling.\nWe calculated the variations of luminosity and temperature of NS with time for\nall EOSs considered in our work and then compared our calculations with the\nobserved astronomical cooling data of pulsars namely Cas A, RX J0822-43, 1E\n1207-52, RX J0002+62, XMMU J17328, PSR B1706-44, Vela, PSR B2334+61, PSR\nB0656+14, Geminga, PSR B1055-52 and RX J0720.4-3125.

In this\nwork, we introduce a new kind of loss, multi-path consistency loss, which\nevaluates the differences between direct translation\n$\\mathcal{D}_s\\to\\mathcal{D}_t$ and indirect translation\n$\\mathcal{D}_s\\to\\mathcal{D}_a\\to\\mathcal{D}_t$ with $\\mathcal{D}_a$ as an\nauxiliary domain, to regularize training. For multi-domain translation (at\nleast, three) which focuses on building translation models between any two\ndomains, at each training iteration, we randomly select three domains, set them\nrespectively as the source, auxiliary and target domains, build the multi-path\nconsistency loss and optimize the network. For two-domain translation, we need\nto introduce an additional auxiliary domain and construct the multi-path\nconsistency loss. We conduct various experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods, including face-to-face translation,\npaint-to-photo translation, and de-raining/de-noising translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 14:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

GANs are a framework for learning a\ngenerative model using a system of two neural networks competing with each\nother. One network generates synthetic images from random input vectors, and\nthe other discriminates between synthetic and real images. The motivation of\nthis study is to create new fonts using the GAN framework while maintaining\nstyle consistency over all characters. In GlyphGAN, the input vector for the\ngenerator network consists of two vectors: character class vector and style\nvector. The former is a one-hot vector and is associated with the character\nclass of each sample image during training. The latter is a uniform random\nvector without supervised information. In this way, GlyphGAN can generate an\ninfinite variety of fonts with the character and style independently\ncontrolled. Experimental results showed that fonts generated by GlyphGAN have\nstyle consistency and diversity different from the training images without\nlosing their legibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 14:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 07:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

In this analysis we use\ntwo independent energy-estimation methods that utilize extensive air shower\nvariables such as the core position, shower angle, and shower lateral energy\ndistribution. In contrast, the previously published HAWC energy spectrum\nroughly estimated the shower energy with only the number of photomultipliers\ntriggered. This new methodology yields a much improved energy resolution over\nthe previous analysis and extends HAWC's ability to accurately measure\ngamma-ray energies well beyond 100 TeV. The energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula\nis well fit to a log parabola shape $\\left(\\frac{dN}{dE} = \\phi_0\n\\left(E/\\textrm{7 TeV}\\right)^{-\\alpha-\\beta\\ln\\left(E/\\textrm{7\nTeV}\\right)}\\right)$ with emission up to at least 100 TeV.

Bright stellar positions are now known with an uncertainty below 1\nmas thanks to Gaia DR2. Between 2019-2020, the Galactic plane will be the\nbackground of Jupiter. The dense stellar background will lead to an increase in\nthe number of occultations, while the Gaia DR2 catalogue will reduce the\nprediction uncertainties for the shadow path.\n  Aims. We observed a stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa (J2) and\npropose a campaign for observing stellar occultations for all Galilean moons.\n  Methods. During a predicted period of time, we measured the light flux of the\nocculted star and the object to determine the time when the flux dropped with\nrespect to one or more reference stars, and the time that it rose again for\neach observational station. The chords obtained from these observations allowed\nus to determine apparent sizes, oblatness, and positions with kilometre\naccuracy.\n  Results. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by\nthe Galilean moon Europa observed on 2017 March 31. The apparent fitted ellipse\npresents an equivalent radius of 1561.2 $\\pm$ 3.6 km and oblatenesses 0.0010\n$\\pm$ 0.0028.

We also present prospects for a campaign to observe the future\nevents that will occur between 2019 and 2021 for all Galilean moons.\n  Conclusions. Stellar occultation is a suitable technique for obtaining\nphysical parameters and highly accurate positions of bright satellites close to\ntheir primary. A number of successful events can render the 3D shapes of the\nGalilean moons with high accuracy.

The linear dispersion -- rather than\nsquare root dispersion of {\\it pure 2D} electron systems with extended Fermi\nsurface -- arises from the strong anisotropy introduced by the Fermi arc\nitself, due to which the continuum of surface particle-hole excitations in this\nsystem will have strong resemblence to the one-dimensional electron systems.\nThis places the Fermi arc electron liquid in between the 1D and 2D electron\nliquids.

Although supervised deep learning can perform accurate\nsegmentation of pathological areas, it is limited by requiring a-priori\ndefinitions of these regions, large-scale annotations, and a representative\npatient cohort in the training set. In contrast, anomaly detection is not\nlimited to specific definitions of pathologies and allows for training on\nhealthy samples without annotation. Anomalous regions can then serve as\ncandidates for biomarker discovery. Knowledge about normal anatomical structure\nbrings implicit information for detecting anomalies. We propose to take\nadvantage of this property using bayesian deep learning, based on the\nassumption that epistemic uncertainties will correlate with anatomical\ndeviations from a normal training set. A Bayesian U-Net is trained on a\nwell-defined healthy environment using weak labels of healthy anatomy produced\nby existing methods. At test time, we capture epistemic uncertainty estimates\nof our model using Monte Carlo dropout. A novel post-processing technique is\nthen applied to exploit these estimates and transfer their layered appearance\nto smooth blob-shaped segmentations of the anomalies. We experimentally\nvalidated this approach in retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images,\nusing weak labels of retinal layers.

The resulting segmentations allowed very high accuracy for separating\nhealthy and diseased cases with late wet AMD, dry geographic atrophy (GA),\ndiabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO).

The key to our\napproach is probabilistically modeling user consensus with respect to each\nentity-attribute pair, rather than modeling each pair as either True or False.\nUncertainty in the model is explicitly represented and used to control the KB's\nprecision. We propose three neural networks for fitting the consensus model and\nevaluate each one on data from Google Maps--a large KB of locations and their\nsubjective and factual attributes.

The conceptual principle and methodological techniques\nbehind the mechanisms involved [in such dynamics] have been harder to grasp\nthan researchers understood them to be. In this paper, we show how to construct\na large variety of behaviors by applying a simple algorithm to networked\nagents, which could, conceivably, offer a straightforward way out of the\ncomplexity. The model starts with the probability that systemic risk spreads.\nEven in a very random social structure, the propagation of risk is guaranteed\nby an arbitrary network property of a set of elements. Despite intensive\nsystemic risk, the potential of the absence of failure could also be driven\nwhen there has been a strong investment in protection through a heuristically\nevolved protection level. It is very interesting to discover that many\napplications are still seeking the mechanisms through which networked\nindividuals build many of these protection process or mechanisms based on\nfitness due to evolutionary drift. Our implementation still needs to be\npolished against what happens in the real world, but in general, the approach\ncould be useful for researchers and those who need to use protection dynamics\nto guard against systemic risk under intrinsic randomness in artificial\ncircumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 09:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

There is considerable momentum toward simplifying such\nanalyses by applying comprehensive community-standard metadata to observational\nand model output data archives.\n  The representation of gridded data is a critical element in describing the\ncontents of model output. We seek here to propose a standard for describing the\ngrids on which such data are discretized. The standard is drafted specifically\nfor inclusion within the Climate and Forecasting (CF) metadata conventions.\n  The contents of this paper have been in the \"grey literature\" since 2007: it\nhas been posted to arXiv to be citable.
