We analyse the common behaviour and differences in the intensities and\nprofiles of different emission lines in flare and quiet modes of Proxima\nactivity.\n  Methods. We compare the pseudo-equivalent widths (pEW) and profiles of the\nemission lines in the HARPS high-resolution (R ~ 115,000) spectra observed at\nthe same epochs.\n  Results. All emission lines show variability with a timescale of at least 10\nmin. The strength of all lines except He I 4026 A correlate with \\Halpha.\nDuring strong flares the `red asymmetry' appears in the Halpha emission line\nindicating the infall of hot condensed matter into the chromosphere with\nvelocities greater than 100 km/s disturbing chromospheric layers. As a result,\nthe strength of the Ca II lines anti-correlates with Halpha during strong\nflares. The He I lines at 4026 and 5876 A appear in the strong flares.

The standard answer is that distributional semantics is not fully\nadequate in this regard, because it falls short on some of the central aspects\nof formal semantic approaches: truth conditions, entailment, reference, and\ncertain aspects of compositionality. We argue that this standard answer rests\non a misconception: These aspects do not belong in a theory of expression\nmeaning, they are instead aspects of speaker meaning, i.e., communicative\nintentions in a particular context.

We propose a new\ndeep approach to Kalman filtering which can be learned directly in an\nend-to-end manner using backpropagation without additional approximations.

One common assumption made in these designs is that the\ncommunication happens over a dedicated network. For many practical\napplications, however, communication must occur over shared networks, leading\nto two critical design challenges, namely - time-delays in the feedback and\nfair sharing of bandwidth among users. In this paper, we present a set of\nsparse H2 control designs under these two design constraints. An important\naspect of our design is that the delay itself can be a function of sparsity,\nwhich leads to an interesting pattern of trade-offs in the H2 performance. We\npresent three distinct algorithms. The first algorithm preconditions the\nassignable bandwidth to the network and produces an initial guess for a\nstabilizing controller. This is followed by our second algorithm, which\nsparsifies this controller while simultaneously adapting the feedback delay and\noptimizing the H2 performance using alternating directions method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). The third algorithm extends this approach to a multiple\nuser scenario where optimal number of communication links, whose total sum is\nfixed, is distributed fairly among users by minimizing the variance of their H2\nperformances. The problem is cast as a difference-of-convex (DC) program with\nmixed-integer linear program (MILP) constraints. We provide theorems to prove\nconvergence of these algorithms, followed by validation through numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 17:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

As transistors\ncontinue to scale down to increase computational performance, physical\nlimitations from nanoscale field-effect operation begin to cause undesirable\ncurrent leakage that is detrimental to the continued advancement of computing.\nUsing a fundamentally different mechanism of operation, we show that through\nnanoscale strain engineering with thin films and ferroelectrics (FEs) the\ntransition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ can be reversibly switched with\nelectric-field induced strain between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ (semimetallic) phase to\na semiconducting MoTe$_2$ phase in a field effect transistor geometry. This\nalternative mechanism for transistor switching sidesteps all the static and\ndynamic power consumption problems in conventional field-effect transistors\n(FETs).

Most theoretical results in this\narea rely on the so-called \\emph{locally tree-like approximation}. This is,\nhowever, usually an `uncontrolled' approximation, in the sense that the\nmagnitudes of the error are typically unknown, although numerical results show\nthat this error is often surprisingly small. In this paper, we place this\napproximation on more rigorous footing by calculating the magnitude of\ndeviations away from tree-based theories in the context of discrete-time\ncritical network cascades with re-excitable nodes. We discuss the conditions\nunder which tree-like approximations give good results for calculating network\ncriticality, and also explain the reasons for deviation from this\napproximation, in terms of the density of certain kinds of network motifs.\nUsing this understanding, we derive results for network criticality that apply\nto general networks that explicitly do not satisfy the locally tree-like\napproximation. In particular, we focus on the bi-parallel motif, the smallest\nmotif relevant to the failure of a tree-based theory in this context, and we\nderive the corrections due to such motifs on the conditions for criticality. We\nverify our claims on computer-generated networks, and we confirm that our\ntheory accurately predicts the observed deviations from criticality. Using our\ntheory, we explain why numerical simulations often show that deviations from a\ntree-based theory are surprisingly small.

We present a method for\naccelerating lattice MC simulations using fully connected and convolutional\nartificial neural networks that are trained to perform local and global moves\nin configuration space, respectively. Both networks take local spacetime MC\nconfigurations as input features and can, therefore, be trained using samples\ngenerated by conventional MC runs on smaller lattices before being utilized for\nsimulations on larger systems. This new approach is benchmarked for the case of\ndeterminant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) studies of the two-dimensional Holstein\nmodel. We find that both artificial neural networks are capable of learning an\nunspecified effective model that accurately reproduces the MC configuration\nweights of the original Hamiltonian and achieve an order of magnitude speedup\nover the conventional DQMC algorithm.

For view aggregation in deep\nlearning models, pooling has been applied extensively. However, pooling leads\nto a loss of the content within views, and the spatial relationship among\nviews, which limits the discriminability of learned features. We propose\n3DViewGraph to resolve this issue, which learns 3D global features by more\neffectively aggregating unordered views with attention. Specifically, unordered\nviews taken around a shape are regarded as view nodes on a view graph.\n3DViewGraph first learns a novel latent semantic mapping to project low-level\nview features into meaningful latent semantic embeddings in a lower dimensional\nspace, which is spanned by latent semantic patterns. Then, the content and\nspatial information of each pair of view nodes are encoded by a novel spatial\npattern correlation, where the correlation is computed among latent semantic\npatterns. Finally, all spatial pattern correlations are integrated with\nattention weights learned by a novel attention mechanism.

Examples of tasks that require rearrangement include packing objects\ninside a bin, wherein objects need to lay according to a predefined pattern.

Nonprehensile actions,\nsuch as pushing and sliding, are preferred because they can be performed using\nminimalistic end-effectors that can easily be inserted in the bin.\nRearrangement with nonprehensile actions is a challenging problem as it\nrequires reasoning about object interactions in a combinatorially large\nconfiguration space of multiple objects.

Additionally, SplitNet generalizes better\nto unseen environments from the same simulator and transfers faster and more\neffectively to novel embodied navigation tasks.

The phase-field formulation is used to resolve the sharp crack\nsurface topology on the anisotropic/non-uniform local state in the regularized\nconcept. To resolve the crack phase-field by a given single preferred\ndirection, second-order structural tensors are imposed to both the bulk and\ncrack surface density functions. Accordingly, a split in tension and\ncompression modes in anisotropic materials is considered. A Global-Local\nformulation is proposed, in which the full displacement/phase-field problem is\nsolved on a lower (local) scale, while dealing with a purely linear elastic\nproblem on an upper (global) scale. Robin-type boundary conditions are\nintroduced to relax the stiff local response at the global scale and enhancing\nits stabilization.

Our main result is that it is NP-hard to decide\nwhether there exists a distribution $p$ for which $\\lambda(\\mathcal{A},p)< 0$,\ni.e. it is NP-hard to decide whether this dynamical system can be stabilized.\n  This hardness result holds even in the \"simple\"' case where $\\mathcal{A}$\ncontains only rank-one matrices. Somewhat surprisingly, this is in stark\ncontrast to the Joint Spectral Radius -- the deterministic kindred of the\nLyapunov exponent -- for which the analogous optimization problem for rank-one\nmatrices is known to be exactly computable in polynomial time.\n  To prove this hardness result, we first observe via Birkhoff's Ergodic\nTheorem that the Lyapunov exponent of rank-one matrices admits a simple formula\nand in fact is a quadratic form in $p$. Hardness of the design problem is shown\nthrough a reduction from the Independent Set problem. Along the way, simple\nexamples are given illustrating that $p \\mapsto \\lambda(\\mathcal{A},p)$ is\nneither convex nor concave in general. We conclude with extensions to\ncontinuous distributions, exchangeable processes, Markov processes, and\nstationary ergodic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 03:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

We first propose a\nstraightforward adaptation of gradient boosting exploiting multiple output\nregression trees as base learners. We then argue that this method is only\nexpected to be optimal when the outputs are fully correlated, as it forces the\npartitioning induced by the tree base learners to be shared by all outputs. We\nthen propose a novel extension of gradient tree boosting to specifically\naddress this issue. At each iteration of this new method, a regression tree\nstructure is grown to fit a single random projection of the current residuals\nand the predictions of this tree are fitted linearly to the current residuals\nof all the outputs, independently. Because of this linear fit, the method can\nadapt automatically to any output correlation structure. Extensive experiments\nare conducted with this method, as well as other algorithmic variants, on\nseveral artificial and real problems. Randomly projecting the output space is\nshown to provide a better adaptation to different output correlation patterns\nand is therefore competitive with the best of the other methods in most\nsettings.

One of the key unsettled issue\nin SNR origin of cosmic ray model is the maximum attainable energy by a cosmic\nray particle in the supernova shock. Recently it has been suggested that an\namplification of effective magnetic field strength at the shock may take place\nin young SNRs due to growth of magnetic waves induced by accelerated cosmic\nrays and as a result the maximum energy achieved by cosmic rays in SNR may\nreach the knee energy instead of $\\sim 200$ TeV as predicted earlier under\nnormal magnetic field situation. In the present work we investigate the\nimplication of such maximum energy scenarios on TeV gamma rays and neutrino\nfluxes from the molecular clouds interacting with the SNR W28. The authors\ncompute the gamma-ray and neutrino flux assuming two different values for the\nmaximum energy reached by cosmic rays in the SNR, from CR interaction in nearby\nmolecular clouds. Both protons and nuclei are considered as accelerated\nparticles and as target material.

These have been used since 1929, because in 1928 FN predicted they would\nbe linear. In the 1950s, a mistake in FN's thinking was found. Corrected theory\nby Murphy and Good (MG) made theoretical FN plots slightly curved. This causes\ndifficulties when attempting to extract precise values of emission\ncharacterization parameters from straight lines fitted to experimental FN\nplots. Improved mathematical understanding, from 2006 onwards, has now enabled\na new FE data-plot form, the \"Murphy-Good plot\".

Given\na network of interacting nodes, nestedness can be described as the tendency for\nnodes to interact with subsets of the interaction partners of better-connected\nnodes. Known since more than $80$ years in biogeography, nestedness has been\nfound in systems as diverse as ecological mutualistic organizations, world\ntrade, inter-organizational relations, among many others. This review article\nfocuses on three main pillars: the existing methodologies to observe nestedness\nin networks; the main theoretical mechanisms conceived to explain the emergence\nof nestedness in ecological and socio-economic networks; the implications of a\nnested topology of interactions for the stability and feasibility of a given\ninteracting system. We survey results from variegated disciplines, including\nstatistical physics, graph theory, ecology, and theoretical economics.\nNestedness was found to emerge both in bipartite networks and, more recently,\nin unipartite ones; this review is the first comprehensive attempt to unify\nboth streams of studies, usually disconnected from each other.

SRAM is widely used for on-chip cache memory in\nmicroprocessors, game software, computers, workstations, portable handheld\ndevices due to high data speed, low power consumption, low voltage supply,\nno-refresh needed. Therefore, to build a reliable cache/memory, the individual\ncell (SRAM) must be designed to have high Static Noise Margin (SNM). In\nsub-threshold region, conventional 6T-cell SRAM experiences poor read and write\nability, and reduction in the SNM at various fluctuation of the threshold\nvoltage, supply voltage down scaling, and technology scaling in nano-meter\nranges (180nm, 90nm, 45nm, 22nm, 16nm and 10nm). Thus, noise margin becomes\nworse during read and write operations compared to hold operation which the\ninternal feedback operates independent of the access transistors. Due to these\nlimitations of the conventional 6T SRAM cell, we have proposed a 9T SRAM that\nwill drastically minimize these limitations; the extra three transistors added\nto the 6T topology will improve the read, hold and write SNM.

In order to improve the mass resolving power\nwhile preserving the acceptance of the storage ring, the IMS with two\nTime-Of-Flight (TOF) detectors has been implemented at the storage ring CSRe in\nLanzhou, China. Additional velocity information beside the revolution time in\nthe ring can be obtained for each of the stored ions by using the double TOF\ndetector system. In this paper, we introduced a new method of using a 658 nm\nlaser range finder and a short-pulsed ultra-violet laser to directly measure\nthe distance and time delay difference between the two TOF detectors which were\ninstalled inside the $10^{-11}$ mbar vacuum chambers. The results showed that\nthe distance between the two ultra-thin carbon foils of the two TOF detectors\nwas ranging from 18032.5 mm to 18035.0 mm over a measurable area of\n20$\\times$20 mm$^2$.\n  Given the measured distance, the time delay difference which comes with\nsignal cable length difference between the two TOF detectors was measured to be\n$\\Delta t_{delay1-2}=99$(26) ps. The new method has enabled us to use the speed\nof light in vacuum to calibrate the velocity of stored ions in the ring. The\nvelocity resolution of the current double TOF detector system at CSRe was\ndeduced to be $\\sigma(v)/v=4.4\\times 10^{-4}$ for laser light, mainly limited\nby the time resolution of the TOF detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 23:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has\nshown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without\nusing human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of\nunsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and\npatient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),\na generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson\nDirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson\ndistribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex\nfactors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the\nempirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts with\nEHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), for the\ndiscovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the\neffectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying latent disease clusters through the\nvisualization of disease representations learned by two approaches. We also\ntested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups\nthrough survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished\ndisease clusters by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could\nstratify patients into more differentiable subgroups than PDM in terms of\np-values. However, the subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying\npatterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the\nalleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could\nbe leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 20:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

Therefore, there is an\nongoing debate about which indicators should be used to measure innovation.\nRecent approaches have favoured the use of composite innovation indicators.\nHowever, there is no consensus about the appropriate methodology to aggregate\nthe varying dimensions of innovation into a single summary indicator. One of\nthe best known examples of composite innovation indicators is the European\nInnovation Scoreboard (EIS). It is a relevant tool for benchmarking innovation\nin Europe. Still, the EIS lacks a proper scheme for weighting the included\nindicators according to their relative importance. In this context, we propose\nan appraisal methodology permitting to take into consideration the interaction\nof criteria and robustness concerns related to the elicitation of the weights\nassigned to the elementary indicators. With this aim, we apply the\nhierarchical-SMAA-Choquet integral approach. This integrated multicriteria\ndecision making (MCDM) method helps the users to rank and benchmark countries'\ninnovation performance taking into account the importance and interaction of\ncriteria assigned by themselves, rather than equal weights or weights\nexogenously fixed by external experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 08:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

When searching online, users may not know how to accurately describe\ntheir product of choice in words. An alternative approach is to search an\nembedding space, allowing the user to query using a representation of the item\n(like a tune for a song, or a picture for an object). However, this approach\nrequires the user to possess an example representation of their desired item.\nAdditionally, most current search systems do not allow the user to dynamically\nadapt the results with further feedback. On the other hand, users often have a\nmental picture of the desired item and are able to answer ordinal questions of\nthe form: \"Is this item similar to what you have in mind?\" With this\nassumption, our algorithm allows for users to provide sequential feedback on\nsearch results to adapt the search feed.

Token-level assignments are\nimportant for downstream tasks such as classification. Even recent models,\nwhich aim to improve the quality of these token-level topic assignments, have\nbeen evaluated only with respect to global metrics. We propose a task designed\nto elicit human judgments of token-level topic assignments. We use a variety of\ntopic model types and parameters and discover that global metrics agree poorly\nwith human assignments.\n  Since human evaluation is expensive we propose a variety of automated metrics\nto evaluate topic models at a local level. Finally, we correlate our proposed\nmetrics with human judgments from the task on several datasets. We show that an\nevaluation based on the percent of topic switches correlates most strongly with\nhuman judgment of local topic quality. We suggest that this new metric, which\nwe call consistency, be adopted alongside global metrics such as topic\ncoherence when evaluating new topic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 00:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

We design an optimal\nproduct offering, pricing and customer portfolio. A framework and solution\napproach for assessing and operating such multi-service battery operations with\nstochastic services and different priority levels is an open problem is\nproposed. The methodology consists in modelling the problem as a two-stage\nstochastic optimization between high priority stochastic grid services and low\npriority cloud storage for stochastic end users. We also propose the\noperational metrics of multiplexing gain and probability of blocking to assess\nthe operation of multi-service multi-user battery. To address the computational\nchallenge of solving the stochastic optimization with a large number of\nend-users, we propose effective capacity as a convex approximation that allows\nan analytical solution. We then provide an empirical analysis based on real\ngrid congestion data from RTE France, and a large dataset of end-users'\nelectricity consumption in California. Our empirical analysis shows (i) our\nproposed effective capacity is a close approximation, (ii) battery operation\nand profit are sensitive to the cost of external resources, number of\nend-users, and RTE's leasing price of the battery, and (iii) with only a slight\ndiscount of the leasing price, the profit of the third party from a stochastic\nresidual battery can be the same as that of a deterministic one. Cloud storage\nas a low priority service can profitably exist alongside other high priority\nbattery services, making integration of more storage in the grid economically\nviable, and allowing larger intermittent renewables, a key path towards reduced\ncarbon emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 21:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 10:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}
