It\nrelies upon a conjecture to deal with the multiple exclusion that takes place\nwhen the states available to single particles are spatially correlated and it\ncan be simultaneously excluded by more than one particle. The Haldane's\nstatistics [F. D. M. Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 937 (1991)] and Wu's\ndistribution [Y.-S. Wu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 2103 (1984)] are recovered in the\nlimit of non-correlated states (constant statistical exclusion) of the multiple\nexclusion statistics. In addition, the exclusion spectrum function $G(n)$ is\nintroduced to account for the dependence of the statistical exclusion on the\noccupation-number $n$. Results of thermodynamics and state occupation are shown\nfor ideal lattice gases of linear particles of size $k$ ($k$-mers) where\nmultiple exclusion occurs. Remarkable agreement is found with simulations from\n$k=2$ to $10$ where multiple exclusion dominates as $k$ increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 16:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

The underlying\ncontinuous formulation includes both \"no-slip\" fluid-structure interaction as\nwell as frictionless contact between multiple elastic bodies. The respective\ninterface conditions in normal and tangential orientation and especially the\nrole of the fluid stress within the region of closed contact are discussed for\nthe general problem of FSCI. To ensure continuity of the tangential constraints\nfrom no-slip to frictionless contact, a transition is enabled by using the\ngeneral Navier condition with varying slip length. Moreover, the fluid stress\nin the contact zone is obtained by an extension approach as it plays a crucial\nrole for the lift-off behavior of contacting bodies. With the given continuity\nof the spatially continuous formulation, continuity of the discrete problem\n(which is essential for the convergence of Newton's method) is reached\nnaturally. As topological changes of the fluid domain are an inherent challenge\nin FSCI configurations, a non-interface fitted Cut Finite Element Method\n(CutFEM) is applied to discretize the fluid domain. All interface conditions,\nthat is the `no-slip' FSI, the general Navier condition, and frictionless\ncontact are incorporated using Nitsche based methods, thus retaining the\ncontinuity and consistency of the model. To account for the strong interaction\nbetween the fluid and solid discretization, the overall coupled discrete system\nis solved monolithically. Numerical examples of varying complexity are\npresented to corroborate the developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 16:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

Such simulators are typically based\non either empirical correlations or first-principles mechanistic models. The\nsimulators allow evaluating the pressure drop in multiphase pipe flow with\nacceptable accuracy. However, the only shortcoming of these correlations and\nmechanistic models is their applicability. In order to extend the applicability\nand the accuracy of the existing accessible methods, a method of pressure drop\ncalculation in the pipeline is proposed. The method is based on well\nsegmentation and calculation of the pressure gradient in each segment using\nthree surrogate models based on Machine Learning algorithms trained on a\nrepresentative lab data set from the open literature. The first model predicts\nthe value of a liquid holdup in the segment, the second one determines the flow\npattern, and the third one is used to estimate the pressure gradient. To build\nthese models, several ML algorithms are trained such as Random Forest, Gradient\nBoosting Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network,\nand their predictive abilities are cross-compared. The proposed method for\npressure gradient calculation yields $R^2 = 0.95$ by using the Gradient\nBoosting algorithm as compared with $R^2 = 0.92$ in case of Mukherjee and Brill\ncorrelation and $R^2 = 0.91$ when a combination of Ansari and Xiao mechanistic\nmodels is utilized. The method for pressure drop prediction is also validated\non three real field cases.

Perturbing the\nexpressions of these characters as generating functions of Gelfand-Tsetlin\npatterns, we produce two families of symmetric polynomials that interpolate\nbetween characters of ${\\rm Sp}_{2n}(\\mathbb{C})$ and ${\\rm\nSO}_{2n+1}(\\mathbb{C})$ and between characters of ${\\rm SO}_{2n}(\\mathbb{C})$\nand ${\\rm SO}_{2n+1}(\\mathbb{C})$. We identify the first family as a\none-parameter specialization of Koornwinder polynomials, for which we thus\nprovide a novel combinatorial structure; on the other hand, the second family\nappears to be new. We next develop a method of Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern\ndecomposition to establish identities between all these polynomials that, in\nthe case of irreducible characters, can be viewed as branching rules. Through\nthese formulas we connect orthogonal and symplectic characters, and more\ngenerally the interpolating polynomials, to LPP models with various symmetries,\nthus going beyond the link with classical Schur polynomials originally found by\nBaik and Rains (Duke Math.

Much of spectral graph theory descends\ndirectly from spectral geometry, the study of differentiable manifolds through\nthe spectra of associated differential operators. But the translation from\nspectral geometry to spectral graph theory has largely focused on results\ninvolving only a few extreme eigenvalues and their associated eigenvalues.\nUnlike in geometry, the study of graphs through the overall distribution of\neigenvalues - the spectral density - is largely limited to simple random graph\nmodels. The interior of the spectrum of real-world graphs remains largely\nunexplored, difficult to compute and to interpret.\n  In this paper, we delve into the heart of spectral densities of real-world\ngraphs. We borrow tools developed in condensed matter physics, and add novel\nadaptations to handle the spectral signatures of common graph motifs. The\nresulting methods are highly efficient, as we illustrate by computing spectral\ndensities for graphs with over a billion edges on a single compute node. Beyond\nproviding visually compelling fingerprints of graphs, we show how the\nestimation of spectral densities facilitates the computation of many common\ncentrality measures, and use spectral densities to estimate meaningful\ninformation about graph structure that cannot be inferred from the extremal\neigenpairs alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 16:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

The boundary of the polygon obstructs both\nvisibility and mobility of a robot. Since the polygon is initially unknown to\nthe robots, the natural approach is to first explore and construct a map of the\npolygon. For this, the robots need an unlimited amount of persistent memory to\nstore the snapshots taken from different points inside the polygon. However, it\nhas been shown by Di Luna et al. [DISC 2017] that map construction can be done\neven by oblivious robots by employing a positional encoding strategy where a\nrobot carefully positions itself inside the polygon to encode information in\nthe binary representation of its distance from the closest polygon vertex. Of\ncourse, to execute this strategy, it is crucial for the robots to make accurate\nmovements. In this paper, we address the question whether this technique can be\nimplemented even when the movements of the robots are unpredictable in the\nsense that the robot can be stopped by the adversary during its movement before\nreaching its destination. However, there exists a constant $\\delta > 0$,\nunknown to the robot, such that the robot can always reach its destination if\nit has to move by no more than $\\delta$ amount.

The model of negotiation and survival of\ngroup leaders are governed by the nature-inspired evolutionary process of queen\nants, also known as Foundress Dilemma. The motivation of using a virtual\ngrouping concept (instead of taking a subset of population as the group\nleaders) is to stay focused on finding the conditions leading individuals in a\nsociety tolerating a significantly diversified (desegregated) neighborhood,\nrather than, indulging into complex details, which would be more relevant to\nstudies targeting the evolution of societal group and leaders.

Although one optimizes\nover the networks parameters, the main loss function generally only depends on\nthe realization of the neural network, i.e. the function it computes. Studying\nthe optimization problem over the space of realizations opens up new ways to\nunderstand neural network training. In particular, usual loss functions like\nmean squared error and categorical cross entropy are convex on spaces of neural\nnetwork realizations, which themselves are non-convex. Approximation\ncapabilities of neural networks can be used to deal with the latter\nnon-convexity, which allows us to establish that for sufficiently large\nnetworks local minima of a regularized optimization problem on the realization\nspace are almost optimal. Note, however, that each realization has many\ndifferent, possibly degenerate, parametrizations.

Besides conventional STM\nmanipulations and electronic structure characterization with single-probe STM,\nintegration of multiple atomically precisely controlled probes in a multiprobe\nSTM system vastly extends the capability of in situ characterization to a new\ndimension where the charge and spin transport behaviors can be examined from\nmesoscopic to atomic length scale. The automation of the atomic scale\nmanipulation and the integration with the well-established lithographic\nprocesses would further push this bottom-up approach to a new level that\ncombines reproducible fabrication, extraordinary programmability, and the\nability to produce large-scale arrays of quantum structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 17:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

For autonomous agents to have this\ncapability, they must be able to extract reusable skills from past experience\nthat can be recombined in new ways for subsequent tasks. Furthermore, when\ncontrolling complex high-dimensional morphologies, such as humanoid bodies,\ntasks often require coordination of multiple skills simultaneously. Learning\ndiscrete primitives for every combination of skills quickly becomes\nprohibitive. Composable primitives that can be recombined to create a large\nvariety of behaviors can be more suitable for modeling this combinatorial\nexplosion. In this work, we propose multiplicative compositional policies\n(MCP), a method for learning reusable motor skills that can be composed to\nproduce a range of complex behaviors. Our method factorizes an agent's skills\ninto a collection of primitives, where multiple primitives can be activated\nsimultaneously via multiplicative composition. This flexibility allows the\nprimitives to be transferred and recombined to elicit new behaviors as\nnecessary for novel tasks. We demonstrate that MCP is able to extract\ncomposable skills for highly complex simulated characters from pre-training\ntasks, such as motion imitation, and then reuse these skills to solve\nchallenging continuous control tasks, such as dribbling a soccer ball to a\ngoal, and picking up an object and transporting it to a target location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 17:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

However, the five-dimensional mass terms of bulk\nfermions must be odd functions on the orbifold, and as such they should be\ndescribed by a field depending on the coordinate of the extra dimension. We\ndemonstrate the feasibility of dynamically generating these fermion bulk masses\nwith a bulk scalar field in warped extra dimensions. The bulk scalar acquires a\nvacuum expectation value, which is odd under the orbifold symmetry and gives\nrise to the fermion bulk masses through non-universal Yukawa-like interactions.\nLike in the conventional Randall-Sundrum setup, the localization of the\ndifferent fermion zero modes along the extra dimension naturally explains the\nobserved flavor structure and four-dimensional mass hierarchy of the SM\nfermions.

Prior works have\nshown that a class of scheduling strategies called threshold based strategies\n(TBSs) achieve optimal system utility under temporal fairness constraints. The\noptimal TBS thresholds are determined as a function of the channel statistics.\nIn order to provide performance guarantees for TBSs in practical scenarios ---\nwhere the scheduler learns the optimal thresholds based on the empirical\nobservations of the channel realizations --- it is necessary to evaluate the\nrates of convergence of TBS thresholds to the optimal value.

Traditional approaches to this problem are based\neither on the materialization of subresults (to avoid their recomputation) or\non the recomputation of subresults (to avoid the space overhead of\nmaterialization). Both techniques have recently been shown suboptimal: instead\nof materializing results and subresults, one can maintain a data structure that\nsupports efficient maintenance under updates and can quickly enumerate the full\nquery output, as well as the changes produced under single updates.\nUnfortunately, these data structures have been developed only for\naggregate-join queries composed of equi-joins, limiting their applicability in\ndomains such as CER where temporal joins are commonplace. In this paper, we\npresent a new approach for dynamically evaluating queries with multi-way\ntheta-joins under updates that is effective in avoiding both materialization\nand recomputation of results, while supporting a wide range of applications. To\ndo this we generalize Dynamic Yannakakis, an algorithm for dynamically\nprocessing acyclic equi-join queries.

Normal tensile strengths of all\nvulcanizates were similar. At the relatively slow strain rate experienced\nwholesale by normal uncut specimens, all vulcanizates, prior to crack\ninitiation, strain-crystallized sufficiently to be strong. However, pre-cut\nspecimens experience increased strain rate at a cut tip. Magnification of the\nstrain rate increases as cut depth c increases. Fracture in the gum NR and\nvulcanizates with up to 14 phr of black occurred by simple forward crack growth\nfrom a cut tip, and all exhibited a critical cut size, above which strength\ndropped abruptly. Furthermore, for these lightly filled samples, strength and\ncritical cut size decreased with increased black content. This indicates less\nstrain-crystalliation before rupture of pre-cut specimens, when levels of black\nare low. This effect is attributerd to rapid straining at a cut tip and\nhindering of the chain mobility necessary for crystallization. When black\ncontent was increased to 15 phr, with 1 mm<c<2 mm, about 50% of specimens\nretained simple lateral fracture and were weak, but the other 50% developed\ndeviated cracks (knotty tearing) and were significantly stronger than\ncorresponding pre-cut gum specimens, especially at large c. High strength with\nsufficient black levels are attributed to increased strain-crystallization and\nsuper-blunting (multiple cracks) at a cut tip. These inhibit forward crack\ngrowth. For carbon black to enhance strain-crystallization relative to the gum,\nit appears there must be enough of it to form a bound rubber/black network. If\nthe black concentration is less than this percolation threshold,\nstrain-crystallization is hindered at a cut tip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 18:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

To avoid denial of service attacks and\nmonetize the services, payment transactions are executed whenever code is being\nexecuted between contracts. It is thus natural to investigate if predictive\nanalysis is capable to forecast these interactions.

Technically\nspeaking, two essential limitations can be found in such model-based\napproaches: 1) the mitigation cannot be achieved without degrading the accuracy\nof the machine learning models, and 2) when the data used for training are\nlargely biased, the training time automatically increases so as to find\nsuitable learning parameters that help produce fair results. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose in this work a new framework that can largely mitigate\nthe biases and discriminations in machine learning systems while at the same\ntime enhancing the prediction accuracy of these systems. The proposed framework\nis based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), which are used\nto generate new synthetic fair data with selective properties from the original\ndata.

In\nrecent years, Markov State Models have gained immense popularity for computing\nstate-to-state dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. However, the\nassumption that the underlying dynamics on the reduced space is Markovian\ninduces a systematic bias in the model, especially in biomolecular systems with\ncomplicated energy landscapes. To address this problem, we have devised a new\napproach we call quasi-stationary distribution kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC)\nthat gives accurate long time state-to-state evolution while retaining the\nentire time resolution even when the dynamics is highly non-Markovian. The\nproposed method is a kinetic Monte Carlo approach that takes advantage of two\nconcepts: (i) the quasi-stationary distribution and (ii) dynamical corrections\ntheory. Implementation of QSD-KMC imposes stricter requirements on the lengths\nof the trajectories than in a Markov State Model approach, as the trajectories\nmust be long enough to dephase. However, the QSD-KMC model produces\nstate-to-state trajectories that are statistically indistinguishable from an MD\ntrajectory mapped onto the discrete set of states, for an arbitrary choice of\nstate decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can be used to\nconstruct a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of\nthe initial choice of states. We demonstrate the QSD-KMC method on two\none-dimensional model systems, one of which is a driven nonequilibrium system,\nand on two well-characterized biomolecular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 00:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 18:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The choice of read-out in the meter determines the\ntrade-off between irreversible decoherence and measurement information by\nsteering the system into a corresponding set of conditional output states. The\nHilbert space algebra of entanglement ensures that the irreversible part of the\ndecoherence is exactly equal to the Hellinger distance describing the\nresolution achieved in the measurement.

Herlihy [Herlihy, 2018] invented this protocol by using hashed\ntimelock contracts. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D =\n(V,A). Vertex set V denotes a set of parties and arc set A denotes a set of\nproposed asset transfers.

Thus, the\npolarization vector of a linearly polarized light may rotate during the\npropagation. The rotation angle of the polarization vector depends on both the\nphoton energy and the distance of the source. It is believed that if the\nrotation angle differs by more than $\\pi/2$ over an energy range, then the net\npolarization of the signal would be significantly suppressed and could not be\nas high as the observed level. Thus, the detection of highly polarized photons\nimplies that the relative rotation angle ($\\Delta\\Theta$) should not be too\nlarge. In this paper, we give a detailed calculation on the evolution of\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) polarization arising from a possible violation of the\nWEP, and we find that more than $60\\%$ of the initial polarization degree can\nbe conserved even if $\\Delta\\Theta$ is larger than $\\pi/2$. In addition, to\ntightly constrain the WEP violation, GRBs with harder spectra and polarization\nobservations in a wider energy range seem to be favored.

Gaussian processes (GPs) are an attractive\nchoice for modeling real-valued nonlinear functions due to their flexibility\nand uncertainty quantification. However, the typical GP regression model\nsuffers from several drawbacks: 1) Conventional GP inference scales $O(N^{3})$\nwith respect to the number of observations; 2) Updating a GP model sequentially\nis not trivial; and 3) Covariance kernels typically enforce stationarity\nconstraints on the function, while GPs with non-stationary covariance kernels\nare often intractable to use in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose\na sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to fit infinite mixtures of GPs that capture\nnon-stationary behavior while allowing for online, distributed inference. Our\napproach empirically improves performance over state-of-the-art methods for\nonline GP estimation in the presence of non-stationarity in time-series data.\nTo demonstrate the utility of our proposed online Gaussian process\nmixture-of-experts approach in applied settings, we show that we can\nsucessfully implement an optimization algorithm using online Gaussian process\nbandits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 02:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 15:54:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 02:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 03:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 11:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

This works well for normal head\nanatomies, but fails in the presence of unexpected lesions. Deep convolutional\nneural networks leverage instead spatial patterns and can learn to segment\nlesions, but often ignore prior probabilities. Approach: We add three sources\nof prior information to a three-dimensional convolutional network, namely,\nspatial priors with a TPM, morphological priors with conditional random fields,\nand spatial context with a wider field-of-view at lower resolution. We train\nand test these networks on 3D images of 43 stroke patients and 4 healthy\nindividuals which have been manually segmented. Results: We demonstrate the\nbenefits of each sources of prior information, and we show that the new\narchitecture, which we call Multiprior network, improves the performance of\nexisting segmentation software, such as SPM, FSL, and DeepMedic for abnormal\nanatomies. The relevance of the different priors was compared and the TPM was\nfound to be most beneficial. The benefit of adding a TPM is generic in that it\ncan boost the performance of established segmentation networks such as the\nDeepMedic and a UNet. We also provide an out-of-sample validation and clinical\napplication of the approach on an additional 47 patients with disorders of\nconsciousness. We make the code and trained networks freely available.\nConclusions: Biomedical images follow imaging protocols that can be leveraged\nas prior information into deep convolutional neural networks to improve\nperformance. The network segmentations match human manual corrections performed\nin 3D, and are comparable in performance to human segmentations obtained from\nscratch in 2D for abnormal brain anatomies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 02:54:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 19:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 16:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 14:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Recently, a growing number of studies are intended\nfor object detection on resource constraint devices, such as YOLOv1, YOLOv2,\nSSD, MobileNetv2-SSDLite, whose accuracy on COCO test-dev detection results are\nyield to mAP around 22-25% (mAP-20-tier).

The experimental design includes two factors:\nTMS intensity (10%, 65%, and 90% of the phosphene threshold) and crowding (high\nand low) conditions. The accuracy results show that there is a strong\ninteraction between crowding condition and TMS condition.

In our FTS observations,\nimportant FIR cooling lines in the ISM, including CO J=4-3 to 13-12, [CI] 370\nmicron, and [NII] 205 micron, were clearly detected. In combination with\nground-based CO data, we then constructed CO spectral line energy distributions\n(SLEDs) on 10 pc scales over a 60 pc x 60 pc area and found that the shape of\nthe observed CO SLEDs considerably changes across 30 Doradus, e.g., the peak\ntransition varies from J=6-5 to 10-9, while the slope characterized by the\nhigh-to-intermediate J ratio ranges from 0.4 to 1.8.

Specifically, PhaNet discovers the most relevant regions to the\nfacial expression by an attention mechanism in hierarchical scales, and the\nmost informative scales are then selected to learn the pose-invariant and\nexpression-discriminative representations. PhaNet is end-to-end trainable by\nminimizing the hierarchical attention losses, the FER loss and pose loss with\ndynamically learned loss weights. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nPhaNet on three multi-view datasets (BU-3DFE, Multi-pie, and KDEF) and two\nin-the-wild FER datasets (AffectNet and SFEW).

Middle-school girls appear to be engaged in\ncoding courses, but when they choose academic majors relevant to their future\ncareers, only few pursue computer science as a major. In order to show students\na new way of learning and to engage them with coding activities, we used the\nlearning app Pocket Code. In the \"No One Left Behind\" H2020 European project,\nthe app was evaluated in several school subjects. An evaluation of the\nattractiveness of the app shows that students were motivated by Pocket Code's\nease of use and its appealing design; however, girls rated the app less\nenthusiastically. To appeal to female teenagers in particular, a tailored\nversion of the app \"Luna&Cat\" has been developed. This customised version\nstands in contrast to the \"one size fits all\" solution Pocket Code, which may\ndiscourage certain user groups. For apps to have a higher chance to appeal to a\nspecific target group, it is, among many other points, necessary to optimise\ntheir store listing on app stores, especially as we found that app stores are\nthe most effective way to reach teenagers. Thus, this paper covers the\nfollowing research question. What customizations are necessary in Pocket Code\nto reinforce female teenagers in their coding activities? To answer this\nquestion, a focus group discussion was performed. This discussion first brought\ninsights about our target group and suggested names and designs for the new\napp; and second, allowed each student to make proposals for their desired\ngames. Later, these game ideas were analysed, graphically designed, and further\ndeveloped together with university design students. By showing female teenagers\ngames designed by other young women in their age group, we help them to get\nideas and inspiration to code their own programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 07:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

With a\ncarefully-designed objective function, mathematical optimization can be quite\nhelpful in solving many problems.

The basic idea is to consider the neural network as an objective\nfunction, and the input as an optimization variable. For the learning of\nobjective function from the training data, two processes are conducted: In the\ninner process, the optimization variable (the input of the network) are\noptimized to minimize the objective function (the network output), while fixing\nthe network weights. In the outer process, on the other hand, the weights are\noptimized based on how close the final solution of the inner process is to the\ndesired solution. After learning the objective function, the solution for the\ntest set is obtained in the same manner of the inner process.

We formulate the joint optimization problem of maximizing the\nsecrecy rate (Max-SR) over the transmit antenna selection and ANP in the\ncontext of secure SM-aided networks, which is mathematically a non-linear mixed\ninteger programming problem. In order to solve this problem, we provide a pair\nof solutions, namely joint and separate solutions. Specifically, an accurate\napproximation of the SR is used for reducing the computational complexity, and\nthe optimal AN covariance matrix (ANCM) is found by convex optimization for any\ngiven active antenna group (AAG). Then, given a large set of AAGs, simulated\nannealing mechanism is invoked for optimizing the choice of AAG, where the\ncorresponding ANCM is recomputed by this optimization method as well when the\nAAG changes. To further reduce the complexity of the above-mentioned joint\noptimization, a low-complexity two-stage separate optimization method is also\nproposed. Furthermore, when the number of transmit antennas tends to infinity,\nthe Max-SR problem becomes equivalent to that of maximizing the ratio of the\ndesired user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio to the eavesdropper's.\nThus our original problem reduces to a fractional programming problem, hence a\nsignificant computational complexity reduction can be achieved for the\noptimization problem.

Controlling an unsteady fluid flow is\nparticularly important, as flow control is a key enabler for technologies in\nenergy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g., planes,\ntrains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and\nhealth (e.g., artificial hearts and artificial respiration). However, the\nhigh-dimensional, nonlinear, and multi-scale dynamics make real-time feedback\ncontrol infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional systems exhibit\ndominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for\neffective control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system\nis not required. Advances in machine learning have the potential to\nrevolutionize flow control given its ability to extract principled, low-rank\nfeature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep\nlearning model predictive control (DeepMPC) framework that exploits low-rank\nfeatures of the flow in order to achieve considerable improvements to control\nperformance. Instead of predicting the entire fluid state, we use a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant quantities of\nthe system. The RNN is then embedded into a MPC framework to construct a\nfeedback loop, and incoming sensor data is used to perform online updates to\nimprove prediction accuracy. The results are validated using varying fluid flow\nexamples of increasing complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 08:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

In fact, user's behaviors from different\ndomains regarding the same items are usually relevant. Therefore, we can learn\ncomplete user behaviors to alleviate the sparsity using complementary\ninformation from correlated domains. It is intuitive to model users' behaviors\nusing graph, and graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown the great\npower for representation learning, which can be used to learn item embedding.\nHowever, it is challenging to transfer the information across domains and learn\ncross-domain representation using the existing GNNs.

The reason is that\nthey are only optimized for good weather conditions and given noise models.\nHowever, most of them fail, if data with unknown disturbances occur, and their\nperformance decrease enormously. One possibility to still obtain reliable\nresults is to observe the environment with different sensor types, such as\ncamera and lidar, and to fuse the sensor data by means of neural networks,\nsince different sensors behave differently in diverse weather conditions.\nHence, the sensors can complement each other by means of an appropriate sensor\ndata fusion. Nevertheless, the fusion-based approaches are still susceptible to\ndisturbances and fail to classify disturbed image areas correctly. This problem\ncan be solved by means of a special training method, the so called Robust\nLearning Method (RLM), a method by which the neural network learns to handle\nunknown noise. In this work, two different sensor fusion architectures for\nsemantic segmentation are compared and evaluated on several datasets.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the RLM increases the robustness in adverse\nweather conditions enormously, and achieve good results although no disturbance\nmodel has been learned by the neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 09:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

We detect multifractal (nonlinear) signatures in the full\nmonitoring and densely sampled period of the H$\\beta$ line and 5100 {\\AA}\ncontinuum light curves of NGC 5548, possibly indicating the presence of complex\nand nonlinear interaction in the 5100 {\\AA} continuum and H$\\beta$ emission\nline regions. Moreover, the degree of multifractality of H$\\beta$ line is found\nto be about twice that of the 5100 {\\AA} continuum. The nonlinearity of both\nemissions could be generated when the broad-line region reprocesses the\nradiation from the central compact source. Finally, we found that\nanti-persistent long-range temporal correlation is the main source of the\nmultifractality detected in both light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 10:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

This is achieved through the so-called Capsules (i.e., groups of neurons)\nthat encode both the instantiation probability and the spatial information.\nHowever, one of the major hurdles in the wide adoption of CapsNets is their\ngigantic training time, which is primarily due to the relatively higher\ncomplexity of their new constituting elements that are different from CNNs. In\nthis paper, we implement different optimizations in the training loop of the\nCapsNets, and investigate how these optimizations affect their training speed\nand the accuracy. Towards this, we propose a novel framework FasTrCaps that\nintegrates multiple lightweight optimizations and a novel learning rate policy\ncalled WarmAdaBatch (that jointly performs warm restarts and adaptive batch\nsize), and steers them in an appropriate way to provide high training-loop\nspeedup at minimal accuracy loss.

Moreover, the presence of outliers\ncan make the clustering problems to be much more challenging. To reduce the\ncomplexities, various sampling methods have been proposed in past years.\nNamely, we take a small sample (uniformly or non-uniformly) from input and run\nan existing approximation algorithm on the sample. Comparing with existing\nnon-uniform sampling methods, the uniform sampling approach has several\nsignificant benefits. For example, it only needs to read the data in one-pass\nand is very easy to implement in practice. Thus, the effectiveness of uniform\nsampling for clustering with outliers is a natural and fundamental problem\ndeserving to study in both theory and practice. In this paper, we propose a new\nand unified framework for analyzing the effectiveness of uniform sampling for\nthree representative center-based clustering with outliers problems,\n$k$-center/median/means clustering with outliers. We introduce a \"significance\"\ncriterion and prove that the performance of uniform sampling depends on the\nsignificance degree of the given instance. In particular, we show that the\nsample size can be independent of the ratio $n/z$ and the dimensionality. More\nimportantly, to the best of our knowledge, our method is the first uniform\nsampling approach that allows to discard exactly $z$ outliers for these three\ncenter-based clustering with outliers problems. The results proposed in this\npaper also can be viewed as an extension of the previous sub-linear time\nalgorithms for the ordinary clustering problems (without outliers). The\nexperiments suggest that the uniform sampling method can achieve comparable\nclustering results with other existing methods, but greatly reduce the running\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 10:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 14:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 01:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

We claim that\nsome of the brittleness stems from variance differences, i.e. when different\nenvironment areas - states and/or actions - have different rewards variance.\nThis causes two problems: First, the \"Boring Areas Trap\" in algorithms such as\nQ-learning, where moving between areas depends on the current area variance,\nand getting out of a boring area is hard due to its low variance. Second, the\n\"Manipulative Consultant\" problem, when value-estimation functions used in DQN\nand Actor-Critic algorithms influence the agent to prefer boring areas,\nregardless of the mean rewards return, as they maximize estimation precision\nrather than rewards. This sheds a new light on how exploration contribute to\ntraining, as it helps with both challenges.

Such soft-soft tower configurations\ngenerally have their fundamental side-side frequency in the below-rated\noperational domain. Because the turbine rotor practically has or develops a\nmass imbalance over time, a periodic and rotor-speed dependent side-side\nexcitation is present during below-rated operation. Persistent operation at the\ncoinciding tower and rotational frequency degrades the expected structural life\nspan. To reduce this effect, earlier work has shown the effectiveness of active\ntower damping control strategies using collective pitch control. A more passive\napproach is frequency skipping by inclusion of speed exclusion zones, which\navoids prolonged operation near the critical frequency. However, neither of the\nmethods incorporate a convenient way of performing a trade-off between energy\nmaximization and fatigue load minimization. Therefore, this paper introduces a\nquasi-linear parameter varying model predictive control (qLPV-MPC) scheme,\nexploiting the beneficial (convex) properties of a qLPV system description.

Combining these two approaches, a compact and mathematically\nsound formulation of the CM-LBM with external forcing is proposed. More\nspecifically, the proposed formalism fully takes advantage of the D3Q27\ndiscretization by relying on the corresponding set of 27 Hermite polynomials\n(up to the sixth order) for the derivation of both the discrete equilibrium\nstate and the forcing term.

From pair distribution function analysis, we observe that sodium\nions are inserted into titanium vacancies at the early stage of the discharge\nprocess. This is supported by density functional theory calculations, which\npredict that sodium insertion is more favourable at vacancies than at\ninterstitial sites. Our calculations also show that the intercalation voltage\nis sensitive to the anion coordination environment of the vacancy. Sodiation to\nhigher concentrations induces a phase transition toward a disordered\nrhombohedral structure, similar to that observed in defect-free TiO2.

This\napproach is costly, time-consuming and labour intensive, and therefore acts to\nlimit patient throughout and acts as one of the factors limiting the wider\nadoption of DCR-MRI in clinical practice. Therefore, to address this issue, we\npresent the first use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) as a basis for\nautomatic segmentation of a dynamic sequence, in this case, kidney ROIs in\nDCE-MRI. Using DMD coupled combined with thresholding and connected component\nanalysis is first validated on synthetically generated data with known\nground-truth, and then applied to ten healthy volunteers' DCE-MRI datasets.

Inspired by the F-Principle, we\npropose an effective model of linear F-Principle (LFP) dynamics which\naccurately predicts the learning results of two-layer ReLU neural networks\n(NNs) of large widths.

This reduces their flexibility when dealing\nwith workloads of workflows, as the workloads are often subject to\nunpredictable resource demand fluctuations. Moreover, autoscaling in clouds\nalmost always imposes budget constraints that should be satisfied. The\nbudget-aware autoscalers for workflows usually require task runtime estimates\nto be provided beforehand, which is not always possible when dealing with\nworkloads due to their dynamic nature. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel Performance-Feedback Autoscaler (PFA) that is budget-aware and does not\nrequire task runtime estimates for its operation.

However, one big limitation of previous research is that the\nsecurity domain and the privacy domain have typically been considered\nseparately. It is thus unclear whether the defense methods in one domain will\nhave any unexpected impact on the other domain.\n  In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this limitation by combining\nthe two domains. In particular, we measure the success of membership inference\nattacks against six state-of-the-art defense methods that mitigate the risk of\nadversarial examples (i.e., evasion attacks). Membership inference attacks\ndetermine whether or not an individual data record has been part of a model's\ntraining set. The accuracy of such attacks reflects the information leakage of\ntraining algorithms about individual members of the training set. Adversarial\ndefense methods against adversarial examples influence the model's decision\nboundaries such that model predictions remain unchanged for a small area around\neach input. However, this objective is optimized on training data. Thus,\nindividual data records in the training set have a significant influence on\nrobust models. This makes the models more vulnerable to inference attacks.\n  To perform the membership inference attacks, we leverage the existing\ninference methods that exploit model predictions. We also propose two new\ninference methods that exploit structural properties of robust models on\nadversarially perturbed data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that\ncompared with the natural training (undefended) approach, adversarial defense\nmethods can indeed increase the target model's risk against membership\ninference attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 15:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 04:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 19:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

In this article, we establish\nthat the nonparametric bootstrap for the HAL-TMLE, fixing the value of the\nsectional variation norm at a value larger or equal than the cross-validation\nselector, provides a consistent method for estimating the normal limit\ndistribution of the HAL-TMLE.\n  In order to optimize the finite sample coverage of the nonparametric\nbootstrap confidence intervals, we propose a selection method for this\nsectional variation norm that is based on running the nonparametric bootstrap\nfor all values of the sectional variation norm larger than the one selected by\ncross-validation, and subsequently determining a value at which the width of\nthe resulting confidence intervals reaches a plateau.\n  We demonstrate our method for 1) nonparametric estimation of the average\ntreatment effect based on observing on each unit a covariate vector, binary\ntreatment, and outcome, and for 2) nonparametric estimation of the integral of\nthe square of the multivariate density of the data distribution.

This wave phenomenon, known as Bloch oscillations\n(BOs), pertains to many physical systems. Can BOs also occur in topological\ninsulators with topologically protected edge states? This question is highly\nnontrivial, because in topological insulators with broken time-reversal\nsymmetry, the edge states propagate unidirectionally without backscattering,\nhence BOs that typically involve stages, where wavepacket moves along and\nagainst the direction of the force, seem to be impossible in such systems when\nforce acts parallel to the edge of the insulator. Here we reveal that BOs still\noccur with topological edge states, but in a nonconventional way: they are\naccompanied not only by oscillations along the edge in the direction of force,\nbut also by oscillations in the direction transverse to that of the force. Full\nBO cycle involves switching between edge states at the opposite edges through\ndelocalized bulk modes. Bloch oscillations of the topological edge states\nrequire to scan the first Brillouin zone twice to complete one cycle, thus they\nhave a period that is two times larger than the period of usual BOs.

We focus our evaluation on small encoder architectures, which\ncan be potentially run on mobile devices during both inference (re-using a\ncommon learned representation across multiple downstream tasks) and training\n(capturing the true data distribution without compromising users' privacy when\ncombined with federated learning). We evaluate the quality of the embeddings\nproduced by the self-supervised learning models, and show that they can be\nre-used for a variety of downstream tasks, and for some tasks even approach the\nperformance of fully supervised models of similar size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 13:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

However, current benchmark machine learning\ndatasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the\nstructure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's\nrepresentations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such\nproperties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with\nknown hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)\nis comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with\n11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,\nmedial vowel, and final consonant glyphs.

Supervised deep network representations contain structure\nrelated to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional\nstructure of the data is not evident.

It was shown in earlier work that data obtained via\nelectroencephalography (EEG) are affected only by the irrotational component of\nthe current. The irrotational component is denoted by $\\Psi$ and has support in\nthe cerebrum. This inverse problem is severely ill-posed and requires that\nadditional constraints are imposed. Here, we impose the requirement of the\nminimization of the $L_2$ norm of the current (energy). The function $\\Psi$ is\nexpanded in terms of inverse multiquadric radial basis functions (RBF) on a\nuniform Cartesian grid inside the cerebrum. The minimal energy constraint in\nconjunction with the RBF parametrization of $\\Psi$ results in a Tikhonov\nregularized solution of $\\Psi$. The RBF shape parameter (regularization\nparameter), is computed by solving a 1-D non-linear maximization problem.\nReconstructions are presented using synthetic data with a signal to noise ratio\n(SNR) of $20$ dB. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the exact and the\nreconstructed $\\Psi$ is RMSE=$0.1122$. The proposed reconstruction algorithm is\ncomputationally efficient and can be vectorized in MATLAB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 20:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Text mining offers a computational approach to investigate\nneurology literature and capture meaningful patterns. The overarching goal of\nthis study is to provide a new perspective on case reports of neurological\ndisease and syndrome analysis over the last six decades using text mining.\n  Methods: We extracted diseases and syndromes (DsSs) from more than 65,000\nneurology case reports from 66 journals in PubMed over the last six decades\nfrom 1955 to 2017. Text mining was applied to reports on the detected DsSs to\ninvestigate high-frequency DsSs, categorize them, and explore the linear trends\nover the 63-year time frame.\n  Results: The text mining methods explored high-frequency neurologic DsSs and\ntheir trends and the relationships between them from 1955 to 2017. We detected\nmore than 18,000 unique DsSs and found 10 categories of neurologic DsSs. While\nthe trend analysis showed the increasing trends in the case reports for top-10\nhigh-frequency DsSs, the categories had mixed trends.\n  Conclusion: Our study provided new insights into the application of text\nmining methods to investigate DsSs in a large number of medical case reports\nthat occur over several decades. The proposed approach can be used to provide a\nmacro level analysis of medical literature by discovering interesting patterns\nand tracking them over several years to help physicians explore these case\nreports more efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 17:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
