Our set up is in the context of an Open Quantum System (OQS), where\nthe two atoms, each having two energy levels and represented by Pauli spin\ntensor operators projected along any arbitrary direction. The system mimics the\nrole of a pair of freely falling Unruh De-Witt detectors, which are allowed to\nnon-adiabatically interact with a conformally coupled massless probe scalar\nfield which has the role of background thermal bath. The effective dynamics of\nthis combined system takes into account of the non-adiabatic interaction, which\nis commonly known as the Resonant Casimir Polder Interaction (RCPI) with the\nthermal bath. Our analysis reveals that the RCPI of two stable entangled atoms\nin the quantum vacuum states in OQS depends on the de Sitter space-time\ncurvature relevant to the temperature of the thermal bath felt by the static\nobserver. We also find that, in OQS, RCPI produces a new significant\ncontribution appearing in the effective Hamiltonian of the total system and\nthermal bath under consideration. We find that the Lamb Shift is characterized\nby a decreasing inverse square power-law behavior, $L^{-2}$, when inter atomic\nEuclidean distance, $L$, is much larger than a characteristic length scale,\n$k$, which is the inverse surface gravity of the background De Sitter space. If\nthe background space-time would have been Minkowskian this shift decreases as,\n$L^{-1}$, and is independent of temperature. Thus, we establish a connection\nbetween the curvature of the De Sitter space-time with the Lamb Shift\nspectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 13:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 15:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 19:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 16:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 06:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

The key insight,\nalready observed in the works of Mei, Montanari and Nguyen (2018), Chizat and\nBach (2018) as well as Rotskoff and Vanden-Eijnden (2018), is that a certain\nclass of the finite-dimensional non-convex problems becomes convex when lifted\nto infinite-dimensional space of measures. We leverage this observation and\nshow that the corresponding energy functional defined on the space of\nprobability measures has a unique minimiser which can be characterised by a\nfirst-order condition using the notion of linear functional derivative. Next,\nwe study the corresponding gradient flow structure in 2-Wasserstein metric,\nwhich we call Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics (MFLD), and show that the flow of\nmarginal laws induced by the gradient flow converges to a stationary\ndistribution, which is exactly the minimiser of the energy functional. We\nobserve that this convergence is exponential under conditions that are\nsatisfied for highly regularised learning tasks. Our proof of convergence to\nstationary probability measure is novel and it relies on a generalisation of\nLaSalle's invariance principle combined with HWI inequality. Importantly, we\nassume neither that interaction potential of MFLD is of convolution type nor\nthat it has any particular symmetric structure. Furthermore, we allow for the\ngeneral convex objective function, unlike, most papers in the literature that\nfocus on quadratic loss.

Our techniques are built to prove bounds for natural input\ndistributions. So far, all lower bounds for problems in the model relied on\nconstructing specifically tailored graph families for the specific problem at\nhand, resulting in lower bounds for artificially constructed inputs, instead of\nnatural input distributions.\n  One of our results is a lower bound for the directed planted clique problem.\nIn this problem, an input graph is either a random directed graph (each\ndirected edge is included with probability 1/2), or a random graph with a\nplanted clique of size k. That is, k randomly chosen vertices have all of the\nedges between them included, and all other edges in the graph appear with\nprobability 1/2. The goal is to determine whether a clique exists. We show that\nwhen k = n^(1/4 - eps), this problem requires a number of rounds polynomial in\nn.\n  Additionally, we construct a pseudo-random generator which fools the\nBroadcast Congested Clique. This allows us to show that every k round\nrandomized algorithm in which each processor uses up to n random bits can be\nefficiently transformed into an O(k)-round randomized algorithm in which each\nprocessor uses only up to O(k log n) random bits, while maintaining a high\nsuccess probability. The pseudo-random generator is simple to describe,\ncomputationally very cheap, and its seed size is optimal up to constant\nfactors. However, the analysis is quite involved, and is based on the new\ntechnique for proving lower bounds in the model.\n  The technique also allows us to prove the first average case lower bound for\nthe Broadcast Congested Clique, as well as an average-case time hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 17:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

We\naim to show in a two-step approach that 1-propanol can be formed through\nreaction steps that are expected to take place during the heavy CO freeze-out\nstage by adding C2H2 into the CO + H hydrogenation network via the formation of\npropanal (CH3CH2CHO) as an intermediate and its subsequent hydrogenation.\nTemperature programmed desorption-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is\nused to identify the newly formed propanal and 1-propanol.

The mechanisms that can contribute to the formation of solid-state\npropanal and 1-propanol, as well as other organic compounds, during the heavy\nCO freeze-out stage are constrained by both laboratory experiments and\ntheoretical calculations. Here it is shown that recombination of HCO radicals,\nformed upon CO hydrogenation, with radicals formed upon C2H2 processing - H2CCH\nand H3CCH2 - offers possible reaction pathways to solid-state propanal and\n1-propanol formation.

In this work we present the first generation\nof the (many-body) MB-UCB force field that explicitly accounts for the\ndecomposed molecular interactions commensurate with a variational energy\ndecomposition analysis, including charge transfer, with force field design\nchoices that reduce the computational expense of the MB-UCB potential while\nremaining accurate.

To realize such a classifier, we use an\nadversarial learning framework, which comprises of a spatio-temporal\nautoencoder for reconstructing input video frames and a spatio-temporal\nconvolution network to discriminate them against original video frames. 3D\nconvolutions are used to learn spatial and temporal features from the input\nvideo frames.

Unfortunately, cell size can only be\nobtained by pathologic evaluation of the tumor in the current standard of care.\nPrevious imaging approaches can be implemented on only animal MRI scanners or\nrequire relatively long acquisition times that are undesirable for clinical\nimaging. There is a need to develop cell size imaging for clinics. Experimental\nDesign: We propose a new method, IMPULSED (Imaging Microstructural Parameters\nUsing Limited Spectrally Edited Diffusion) that can characterize mean cell\nsizes in solid tumors. We report the use of combined sequences with different\ngradient waveforms on human MRI and analytical equations that link DWI signals\nof real gradient waveforms and specific microstructural parameters such as cell\nsize. We also describe comprehensive validations using computer simulations,\ncell experiments in vitro, and animal experiments in vivo and finally\ndemonstrate applications in pre-operative breast cancer patients. Results: With\nfast acquisitions (~ 7 mins), IMPULSED can provide high-resolution (1.3 mm\nin-plane) mapping of mean cell size of human tumors in vivo on\ncurrently-available 3T MRI scanners.

The framework consists of a convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based image encoder that extracts region-based visual features\nfrom the input image, and an recurrent neural network (RNN)-based caption\ndecoder that generates the output caption words based on the visual features\nwith the attention mechanism. Despite the success of existing studies, current\nmethods only model the co-attention that characterizes the inter-modal\ninteractions while neglecting the self-attention that characterizes the\nintra-modal interactions. Inspired by the success of the Transformer model in\nmachine translation, here we extend it to a Multimodal Transformer (MT) model\nfor image captioning. Compared to existing image captioning approaches, the MT\nmodel simultaneously captures intra- and inter-modal interactions in a unified\nattention block. Due to the in-depth modular composition of such attention\nblocks, the MT model can perform complex multimodal reasoning and output\naccurate captions. Moreover, to further improve the image captioning\nperformance, multi-view visual features are seamlessly introduced into the MT\nmodel.

Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM)\ncast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an\nindependent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the\nrelations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an\nactor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the\ncollaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we\ninvestigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the\nindependent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We\nargue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order\nrelations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes\n--- are an essential factor for successful recommendation.

For example, the limbs may move more flexibly and\nfreely than the torso does. Most of the existing 3D pose estimation methods,\ndespite the very promising results achieved, treat the body joints equally and\nconsequently often lead to larger reconstruction errors on the limbs. In this\npaper, we propose a progressive approach that explicitly accounts for the\ndistinct DOFs among the body parts. We model parts with higher DOFs like the\nelbows, as dependent components of the corresponding parts with lower DOFs like\nthe torso, of which the 3D locations can be more reliably estimated. Meanwhile,\nthe high-DOF parts may, in turn, impose a constraint on where the low-DOF ones\nlie. As a result, parts with different DOFs supervise one another, yielding\nphysically constrained and plausible pose-estimation results. To further\nfacilitate the prediction of the high-DOF parts, we introduce a pose-attribute\nestimation, where the relative location of a limb joint with respect to the\ntorso, which has the least DOF of a human body, is explicitly estimated and\nfurther fed to the joint-estimation module.

A major challenge in spectral modeling is the Fe-L\nspectrum, which is basically a complex assembly of n>2 to n=2 transitions of Fe\nions in different ionization states, affected by a range of atomic processes\nsuch as collisional excitation, resonant excitation, radiative recombination,\ndielectronic recombination, and innershell ionization.

Based on the ensemble learning framework, the weight of each\ndimension is adaptively adjusted by increasing the inter-class mean with a\ngradient ascent and reducing the intra-class variance with a gradient descent,\nand the classifier is established to identify an early DDoS attack by training\nsimple multiple kernel learning (SMKL) models with two characteristics\nincluding inter-class mean squared difference growth (M-SMKL) and intra-class\nvariance descent (S-SMKL). The sliding window mechanism is used to coordinate\nthe S-SMKL and M-SMKL to detect the early DDoS attack.

Previously, it has been found that there exists a\ncorrelation among three key parameters concerning the plateau phase, i.e., the\nend time of the plateau phase in the GRB rest frame ($T_{a}$), the\ncorresponding X-ray luminosity at the end time ($L_{X}$) and the isotropic\nenergy of the prompt GRB ($E_{\\gamma,\\rm{iso}}$). In this study, we\nsystematically search through all the \\emph{Swift} GRBs with a plateau phase\nthat occurred between 2005 May and 2018 August. We collect 174 GRBs, with\nredshifts available for all of them. For the whole sample, the correlation\nbetween $L_{X}$, $T_{a}$ and $E_{\\gamma,\\rm{iso}}$ is confirmed, with the best\nfit relation being $L_{X}\\propto T_{a}^{-1.01}E_{\\gamma,\\rm{iso}}^{0.84}$. Such\nan updated three-parameter correlation still supports that the central leftover\nafter GRBs is probably a millisecond magnetar. It is interesting to note that\nshort GRBs with duration less than 2 s in our sample also follow the same\ncorrelation, which hints that the merger production of two neutron stars could\nbe a high mass magnetar, but not necessarily a black hole. Moreover, GRBs\nhaving an \"internal\" plateau (i.e., with a following decay index being\ngenerally smaller than -3) also obey this correlation. It further strengthens\nthe idea that the internal plateau is due to the delayed collapse of a high\nmass neutron star into a black hole. The updated three-parameter correlation\nindicates that GRBs with a plateau phase may act as a standard candle for\ncosmology study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 07:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 13:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

However, class-specific attributes\nare usually noisy because of annotation errors and diversity of individual\nimages. Therefore, it is desirable to obtain image-specific attributes (ISA),\nwhich are image-level annotations, from the original class-specific attributes.\nIn this paper, we propose to learn image-specific attributes by graph-based\nattribute propagation. Considering the intrinsic property of hyperbolic\ngeometry that its distance expands exponentially, hyperbolic neighborhood graph\n(HNG) is constructed to characterize the relationship between samples. Based on\nHNG, we define neighborhood consistency for each sample to identify\ninconsistent samples. Subsequently, inconsistent samples are refined based on\ntheir neighbors in HNG.

Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high\ncomputational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a\nlarge space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each\nnode in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm\nthat is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering\nstructure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block\nof nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering\nalgorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This\nsimple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and\ncomputational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy\nwith previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a\nnew Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than\n5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit).\nFor training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the\nprevious state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much\nless memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this\ndata, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN\ntraining algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore,\nCluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory\noverhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer\nCluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI\ndataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

An\nelegant and widely used method of semi-analytically integrating trajectories of\nobjects subject to atmospheric drag was proposed by King-Hele (KH). However,\nthe analytical KH contraction method relies on the assumption that the\natmosphere density decays strictly exponentially with altitude. If the actual\ndensity profile does not satisfy the assumption of a fixed scale height, as is\nthe case for Earth's atmosphere, the KH method introduces potentially large\nerrors for non-circular orbit configurations.\n  In this work, the KH method is extended to account for such errors by using a\nnewly introduced atmosphere model derivative. By superimposing exponentially\ndecaying partial atmospheres, the superimposed KH method can be applied\naccurately while considering more complex density profiles. The KH method is\nfurther refined by deriving higher order terms during the series expansion. A\nvariable boundary condition to choose the appropriate eccentricity regime,\nbased on the series truncation errors, is introduced.

Spatial filtering and kernel smoothing\nof the kinematically collected raw data allow efficiently estimating the\nstandard deviations during RFM generation. In the positioning stage, the\nweights control the contribution of each feature to the dissimilarity measure,\nwhich in turn quantifies the difference between the set of online measured\nfeatures and the fingerprints stored in the RFM. Features with little\nvariability contribute more to the estimated position than features with high\nvariability. Iterations are necessary because the variability depends on the\nlocation, and the location is initially unknown when estimating the position.\nUsing real WiFi signal strength data from extended test measurements with\nground truth in an office building, we show that the standard deviations of\nthese features vary considerably within the region of interest and are neither\nsimple functions of the signal strength nor of the distances from the\ncorresponding access points.

Such strong gravity regime is often expected to exhibit\ndeviations from general relativity (GR) which may manifest through the presence\nof extra dimensions. Higher dimensions, which serve as the corner stone for\nstring theory and M-theory can act as promising alternatives to dark matter and\ndark energy with interesting implications in inflationary cosmology,\ngravitational waves and collider physics. Therefore it is instructive to\ninvestigate the effect of more than four spacetime dimensions on the black hole\ncontinuum spectrum which provide an effective astrophysical probe to the strong\ngravity regime. To explore such a scenario, we compute the optical luminosity\nemitted by a thin accretion disk around a rotating supermassive black hole\nalbeit in the presence of extra dimensions. The background metric resembles the\nKerr-Newman spacetime in GR where the tidal charge parameter inherited from\nextra dimensions can also assume negative signature. The theoretical luminosity\ncomputed in such a background is contrasted with optical observations of eighty\nquasars. The difference between the theoretical and observed luminosity for\nthese quasars is used to infer the most favoured choice of the rotation\nparameter for each quasar and the tidal charge parameter. This has been\nachieved by minimizing/maximizing several error estimators, e.g., chi-squared,\nNash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement etc. Intriguingly, all of them\nfavour a negative value for the tidal charge parameter, a characteristic\nsignature of extra dimensions.

However, the origin of the core rotation and its time\nevolution are not well understood. Recent observations reveal that molecular\nclouds exhibit a ubiquity of filamentary structures and that star forming cores\nare associated with the densest filaments. Since these results suggest that\ndense cores form primarily in filaments, the mechanism of core formation from\nfilament fragmentation should explain the distribution of the angular momentum\nof these cores. In this paper we analyze the relation between velocity\nfluctuations along the filament close to equilibrium and the angular momentum\nof the cores formed along its crest. We first find that an isotropic velocity\nfluctuation that follows the three-dimensional Kolmogorov spectrum does not\nreproduce the observed angular momentum of molecular cloud cores. We then\nidentify the need for a large power at small scales and study the effect of\nthree power spectrum models. We show that the one-dimensional Kolmogorov power\nspectrum with a slope -5/3 and an anisotropic model with reasonable parameters\nare compatible with the observations. Our results stress the importance of more\ndetailed and systematic observations of both the velocity structure along\nfilaments and the angular momentum distribution of molecular cloud cores to\ndetermine the validity of the mechanism of core formation from filamentary\nmolecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 13:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Notably, the\nunstable disorder states of uncontrolled cellular proliferation macroscopically\nemerge as complex spatio--temporal patterns that evolve statistically\ncorrelated by a universal law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 13:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

We argue that\nan inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which\nis latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process.\nAs such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the\ncollaborative filtering effect.\n  In this work, we propose to integrate the user-item interactions -- more\nspecifically the bipartite graph structure -- into the embedding process. We\ndevelop a new recommendation framework Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering\n(NGCF), which exploits the user-item graph structure by propagating embeddings\non it. This leads to the expressive modeling of high-order connectivity in\nuser-item graph, effectively injecting the collaborative signal into the\nembedding process in an explicit manner. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthree public benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over several\nstate-of-the-art models like HOP-Rec and Collaborative Memory Network. Further\nanalysis verifies the importance of embedding propagation for learning better\nuser and item representations, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of\nNGCF.

Second, we\nstudy the bulk-boundary correspondence of fragile TIs protected by inversion\nsymmetry. In particular, we generalize the notion of $d$-dimensional ($d$D)\n$k$th-order TIs, which is normally defined for $0<k\\le d$, to the cases with\n$k>d$, and show that they all have fragile topology. In terms of the Dirac\nHamiltonian, a $d$D $k$th-order TI has $(k-1)$ boundary mass terms. We show\nthat a minimal fragile TI with the filling anomaly can be considered as the\n$d$D $(d+1)$th-order TI, and all the other $d$D $k$th-order TIs with $k>(d+1)$\ncan be constructed by stacking $d$D $(d+1)$th-order TIs. Although $d$D\n$(d+1)$th-order TIs have no in-gap states, the boundary mass terms carry an odd\nwinding number along the boundary, which induces localized charges on the\nboundary at the positions where the boundary mass terms change abruptly. In the\ncases with $k>(d+1)$, we show that the net parity of the system with boundaries\ncan distinguish topological insulators and trivial insulators. Also, by\nstudying the (nested) Wilson loop spectra, we determine the minimal number of\nbands to resolve the Wannier obstruction, which is consistent with the\nprediction from our diagnosis method of fragile topology. Finally, we show that\na $(d+1)$D $(k-1)$th-order TI can be obtained by an adiabatic pumping of $d$D\n$k$th-order TI, which generalizes the previous study of the 2D 3rd-order TI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 14:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 10:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 07:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

The reduction of the magnetization is determined over\na range of peak system temperatures and for a number of anisotropy values.

The proposed\nmethods are based on the best uniform rational approximation (BURA)\n$r_{\\alpha,k}(t)$ of $t^{\\alpha}$ on $[0,1]$.

Especially positron emission tomography (PET) is susceptible to motion\ndue to its usually long scan times. In hybrid PET/MRI (magnetic resonance\nimaging), simultaneously acquired dynamic MRI data can be used to correct for\nmotion. Usually, MRI model-based motion correction approaches are applied to\nthe PET data. However, these approaches may fail for non-predictable, irregular\nmotion. We propose a novel approach for the continuous and real-time tracking\nof motion using highly accelerated, dynamic MRI for an accurate motion\nestimation.

A combination of crustquake and vortex unpinning models is invoked to\naccount for the extended spin-up, magnitude and post-glitch relaxation\ncharacteristics of this glitch. We evaluate the extended spin-up followed by\nthe familiar spin-down as due to the creep response to the initial induced\ninward motion of some vortex lines pinned to broken crustal plates moving\ninward towards the rotation axis, together with the common and familiar\npost-glitch creep response to the sudden outward motion of vortices unpinned at\nthe glitch. Our analysis confirms that the number of unpinned vortices\nparticipating in glitches are similar in all Crab glitches, and within an order\nof magnitude in all glitches from all pulsars. This typical number of unpinned\nvortices is related to the broken plate size in quakes as triggers for vortex\nunpinning avalanches.

INTRODUCTION Identification and validation of\nincreasingly complex mechanical models is a major concern in experimental solid\nmechanics. The recent developments of computed tomography coupled with in-situ\ntests provide extremely rich and non-destructive analyses [1].

In both cases the DM halo density is cored with a size $r_0$\nand a central density $\\rho_0$: $\\rho(r)= \\rho_0/(1+r/r_0)(1+(r/r_0)^2)$. Since\n$r_0\\rho_0=120 M_{\\odot}$/pc$^2$ [Donato et al., MNRAS, 397, 1169, 2009], then\nby varying the central density one can reproduce the DM profile in any spiral.\nUsing the Newman-Jains method we extend our solution to obtain a rotating black\nhole surrounded by dark matter halo. We find that, the apparent shape of the\nshadow beside the black hole spin $a$, it also depends on the central density\nof the surrounded dark matter $\\rho_0$. As a specific example we consider the\ngalaxy M87, with a central density $\\rho_0=6.9\\,\\times 10^{6}\nM_{\\odot}$/kpc$^3$ and a core radius $r_0=91.2$ kpc. In the case of M87, our\nanalyses show that the effect of dark matter on the size of the black hole\nshadow is almost negligible compared to the shadow size of the Kerr vacuum\nsolution hence the angular diameter $ 42$ $\\mu$as remains almost unaltered when\nthe dark matter is considered. For a small totally dark matter dominated spiral\nsuch as UGC 7232, we find similar effect of dark matter on the shadow images\ncompared to the M87. However, in specific conditions having a core radius\ncomparable to the black hole mass and dark matter with very high density, we\nshow that the shadow images decreases compared to the Kerr vacuum black hole.\nThe effect of dark matter on the apparent shadow shape can shed some light in\nfuture observations as an indirect way to detect dark matter using the shadow\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 12:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 15:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 09:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Despite their value, however, they\nstill suffer from the challenges of capturing complicated user preferences and\nfine-grained user-POI relationship for spatio-temporal sensitive POI\nrecommendation. Existing recommendation algorithms, including both shallow and\ndeep approaches, usually embed the visiting records of a user into a single\nlatent vector to model user preferences: this has limited power of\nrepresentation and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntopic-enhanced memory network (TEMN), a deep architecture to integrate the\ntopic model and memory network capitalising on the strengths of both the global\nstructure of latent patterns and local neighbourhood-based features in a\nnonlinear fashion. We further incorporate a geographical module to exploit\nuser-specific spatial preference and POI-specific spatial influence to enhance\nrecommendations. The proposed unified hybrid model is widely applicable to\nvarious POI recommendation scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world\nWeChat datasets demonstrate its effectiveness (improvement ratio of 3.25% and\n29.95% for context-aware and sequential recommendation, respectively).
