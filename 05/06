We consider the Matern\ncluster process to model RUs and the probabilistic content placement to cache\nfiles in RUs. Accordingly, we study the exact hit probability for a user of\ninterest for two strategies; closest selection, where the user is served by the\nclosest RU that has its requested file, and best selection, where the serving\nRU having the requested file provides the maximum instantaneous received power\nat the user. As key steps for the analyses, the Laplace transform of out of\ncloud interference, the desired link distance distribution in the closest\nselection, and the desired link received power distribution in the best\nselection are derived. Also, we approximate the derived exact hit probabilities\nfor both the closest and the best selections in such a way that the related\nobjective functions for the content caching design of the network can lead to\ntractable concave optimization problems. Solving the optimization problems, we\npropose algorithms to efficiently find their optimal content placements.\nFinally, we investigate the impact of different parameters such as the number\nof antennas and the cache memory size on the caching performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 16:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

Pinski & Narin (1976) derived the Influence Weight (IW) as an\nalternative to Garfield's JIF. Whereas the JIF is based on raw citation counts\nnormalized by the number of publications, IWs are based on the eigenvectors in\nthe matrix of aggregated journal-journal citations without a reference to size:\nthe cited and citing sides are combined by a matrix approach. IWs emerge as a\nvector after recursive iteration of the normalized matrix. Before recursion, IW\nis a (vector-based) non-network indicator of impact, but after recursion (i.e.\nrepeated improvement by iteration), IWs can be considered a network measure of\nprestige among the journals in the (sub)graph as a representation of a field of\nscience. As a consequence (not intended by Pinski & Narin in 1976), the\nself-citations are integrated at the field level and no longer disturb the\nanalysis as outliers.

We focus on two different models of a qubit in contact with\nthe external environment: the first is the Spin Boson Model (SBM), which gives\na description of the qubit in terms of static tunnelling energy and a bias\nfield. The second model describes an externally driven qubit, where both the\nbias field and the tunnelling rate are controlled by a time-dependent magnetic\nfield obeying to a finite time protocol.

Motivated by\nthe increasing adoption of distributed energy resources into the\ndistribution-level grids, it becomes imperative to estimate the state of\ndistribution grids in order to ensure stable operation. Traditional power\nsystem state estimation techniques mainly focus on the transmission network\nwhich involve solving an overdetermined system and eliminating bad data.\nHowever, distribution networks are typically underdetermined due to the large\nnumber of connection points and high cost of pervasive installation of\nmeasurement devices. In this paper, we consider the recently proposed\nstate-estimation method for underdetermined systems that is based on matrix\ncompletion. In particular, a constrained matrix completion algorithm was\nproposed, wherein the standard matrix completion problem is augmented with\nadditional equality constraints representing the physics (namely power-flow\nconstraints).

Imparting directional emission is an\nessential requirement for many LED implementations. Although optical packaging,\nnano-patterning and surface roughening techniques can enhance LED extraction,\ndirecting the emitted light requires bulky optical components. Optical\nmetasurfaces provide precise control over transmitted and reflected waveforms,\nsuggesting a new route for directing light emission. However, it is difficult\nto adapt metasurface concepts for incoherent light emission, due to the lack of\na phase-locking incident wave. In this Letter, we demonstrate metasurface-based\ndesign of InGaN/GaN quantum-well structures that generate narrow,\nunidirectional transmission and emission lobes at arbitrary engineered angles.\nWe show that the directions and polarization of emission differ significantly\nfrom transmission, in agreement with an analytical Local Density of Optical\nStates (LDOS) model. The results presented in this Letter open a new paradigm\nfor exploiting metasurface functionality in light emitting devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 04:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

The orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) of light, on the other hand, enables quantum encoding in\nhigher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, opening up new opportunities for\nhigh-capacity quantum communications. Due to its turbulence-induced decoherence\neffects, however, the atmospheric channel may limit the practical usage of OAM.\nIn order to determine whether OAM is useful for satellite-based quantum\ncommunications, we numerically investigate the detection likelihoods for OAM\nstates that traverse satellite-to-ground channels. We show that the use of OAM\nthrough such channels is in fact feasible. We use our new results to then\ninvestigate design specifications that could improve OAM detection -\nparticularly the use of advanced adaptive optics techniques. Finally, we\ndiscuss how our work provides new insights into future implementations of\nspace-based OAM systems within the context of quantum communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 06:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

There are categories we know\ncalled \"knowns\", and there are more we do not know called \"unknowns\".\nEnumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is\ninfeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying\nclosed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors.\nTo address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network\n(P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype\nlearning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are\ntrained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features.\nThen P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding\nmethod based on the distance metric between features and prototypes.

Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer\nto \"open\" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically.\nThe weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a\ndistances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this\ninitialization method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples\nneeded to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can\neffectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention\nto recognize a new category.

The first\ncontribution is a generalization of Stokes drift for a plane wave in ideal\nfluid and the second contribution arises due to the fluid viscosity and it is\nexcited by a force applied in the viscous sublayer near the fluid surface. We\nstudy the formation and decay of the induced mass-transport theoretically and\nexperimentally and demonstrate that both contributions have different time\nscales for typical experimental conditions. The evolution of the Euler\ncontribution is described by a diffusion equation, where the fluid kinematic\nviscosity plays the role of the diffusion coefficient, while the Stokes\ncontribution evolves faster, feeling the additional damping near the system\nboundaries. The difference becomes more pronounced if the fluid surface is\ncontaminated.

We introduce a novel detector for terahertz\nradiation that exploits the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, based on a design\nthat employs a dual-gated, dipolar antenna with a gap of 100 nm.

We demonstrate that this\nnovel detector has an excellent sensitivity, with a noise-equivalent power of\n80 pW-per-square-root-Hz at room temperature, a response time below 30 ns\n(setup-limited), a high dynamic range (linear power dependence over more than 3\norders of magnitude) and broadband operation (measured range 1.8-4.2 THz,\nantenna-limited), which fulfills a combination that is currently missing in the\nstate-of-the-art detectors.

Popular methods for MDI use global statistics computed from the\nentire data set (e.g., the feature-wise medians), or build predictive models\noperating independently on every instance. In this paper we propose a more\ngeneral framework for MDI, leveraging recent work in the field of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs). We formulate the MDI task in terms of a graph denoising\nautoencoder, where each edge of the graph encodes the similarity between two\npatterns. A GNN encoder learns to build intermediate representations for each\nexample by interleaving classical projection layers and locally combining\ninformation between neighbors, while another decoding GNN learns to reconstruct\nthe full imputed data set from this intermediate embedding. In order to\nspeed-up training and improve the performance, we use a combination of multiple\nlosses, including an adversarial loss implemented with the Wasserstein metric\nand a gradient penalty. We also explore a few extensions to the basic\narchitecture involving the use of residual connections between layers, and of\nglobal statistics computed from the data set to improve the accuracy.

This limitation is further magnified by the\nimpossibility of traditional neuronal mean-field models ---also known as firing\nrate models, or firing rate equations--- to account for electrical synapses.\nHere we introduce a novel firing rate model that exactly describes the mean\nfield dynamics of heterogeneous populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire\n(QIF) neurons with both chemical and electrical synapses. The mathematical\nanalysis of the firing rate model reveals a well-established bifurcation\nscenario for networks with chemical synapses, characterized by a codimension-2\nCusp point and persistent states for strong recurrent excitatory coupling. The\ninclusion of electrical coupling generally implies neuronal synchrony by virtue\nof a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This transforms the Cusp scenario into a\nbifurcation scenario characterized by three codimension-2 points (Cusp,\nTakens-Bogdanov, and Saddle-Node Separatrix Loop), which greatly reduces the\npossibility for persistent states. This is generic for heterogeneous QIF\nnetworks with both chemical and electrical coupling.

Two\ncomplementary approaches exist for approximating different aspects of WCI\ndynamics. These are the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) approach and the\nGent--McWilliams (GM) approach. Their complementarity is evident in their\nKelvin circulation theorems. GLM introduces a wave pseudomomentum per unit mass\ninto its Kelvin circulation integrand, while GM introduces a an additional\n`bolus velocity' to transport its Kelvin circulation loop. The GLM approach\nmodels Eulerian momentum, while the GM approach models Lagrangian transport. In\nprinciple, both GLM and GM are based on the Euler--Boussinesq (EB) equations\nfor an incompressible, stratified, rotating flow. The differences in their\nKelvin theorems arise from differences in how they model the flow map in the\nLagrangian for the Hamilton variational principle underlying the EB equations.\n  A recently developed approach for uncertainty quantification in fluid\ndynamics constrains fluid variational principles to require that Lagrangian\ntrajectories undergo Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport (SALT).

Analyzing spike sequences\ngenerated by individual neurons and by two coupled neurons (using the\nstochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model), recent theoretical studies have found that\nthe relative timing of the spikes can encode the signal information. Using a\nsymbolic method to analyze the spike sequence, preferred and infrequent spike\npatterns were detected, whose probabilities vary with both, the amplitude and\nthe frequency of the signal. To investigate if this encoding mechanism is\nplausible also for neuronal ensembles, here we analyze the activity of a group\nof neurons, when they all perceive a weak periodic signal. We find that, as in\nthe case of one or two coupled neurons, the probabilities of the spike\npatterns, now computed from the spike sequences of all the neurons, depend on\nthe signal's amplitude and period, and thus, the patterns' probabilities encode\nthe information of the signal. We also find that the resonances with the period\nof the signal or with the noise level are more pronounced when a group of\nneurons perceive the signal, in comparison with when only one or two coupled\nneurons perceive it. Neuronal coupling is beneficial for signal encoding as a\ngroup of neurons is able to encode a small-amplitude signal, which could not be\nencoded when it is perceived by just one or two coupled neurons. Interestingly,\nwe find that for a group of neurons, just a few connections with one another\ncan significantly improve the encoding of small-amplitude signals. Our findings\nindicate that information encoding in preferred and infrequent spike patterns\nis a plausible mechanism that can be employed by neuronal populations to encode\nweak periodic inputs, exploiting the presence of neural noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 11:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Theory: By analytical minimization of the free-energy\nfunctional we derived explicit expressions for the chain-extension and\nchain-end distribution functions in the hydrocarbon core of mixed micelles from\ntwo surfactants of different chainlengths. Findings: The hydrocarbon core of a\ntwo-component micelle is divided in two regions, outer and inner, where the\nends of the shorter and longer chains are located.

Having survived until now, NGC 2682 was likely much more massive in the\npast, and is bound to have an interesting dynamical history. Aims: We\ninvestigate the spatial distribution of NGC 2682 stars to constrain its\ndynamical evolution, especially focusing on the marginally bound stars in the\ncluster outskirts. Methods: We use Gaia DR2 data to identify NGC 2682 members\nup to a distance of ~150 pc (10 degrees). Two methods (Clusterix and UPMASK)\nare applied to this end. We estimate distances to obtain three-dimensional\nstellar positions using a Bayesian approach to parallax inversion, with an\nappropriate prior for star clusters. We calculate the orbit of NGC 2682 using\nthe GRAVPOT16 software. Results: The cluster extends up to 200 arcmin (50 pc)\nwhich implies that its size is at least twice as previously believed. This\nexceeds the cluster Hill sphere based on the Galactic potential at the distance\nof NGC 2682. Conclusions: The extra-tidal stars in NGC 2682 may originate from\nexternal perturbations such as disk shocking or dynamical evaporation from\ntwo-body relaxation. The former origin is plausible given the orbit of NGC\n2682, which crossed the Galactic disk ~40 Myr ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 13:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The established measure\nfor quantifying such relations is the mutual information. However, estimating\nmutual information from limited samples is a challenging task. Since the mutual\ninformation is the difference of two entropies, the existing Bayesian\nestimators of entropy may be used to estimate information. This procedure,\nhowever, is still biased in the severely under-sampled regime. Here we propose\nan alternative estimator that is applicable to those cases in which the\nmarginal distribution of one of the two variables---the one with minimal\nentropy---is well sampled. The other variable, as well as the joint and\nconditional distributions, can be severely undersampled. We obtain an estimator\nthat presents very low bias, outperforming previous methods even when the\nsampled data contain few coincidences. As with other Bayesian estimators, our\nproposal focuses on the strength of the interaction between two discrete\nvariables, without seeking to model the specific way in which the variables are\nrelated. A distinctive property of our method is that the main data statistics\ndetermining the amount of mutual information is the inhomogeneity of the\nconditional distribution of the low-entropy variable in those states (typically\nfew) in which the large-entropy variable registers coincidences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 13:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

We find\naverage temperature enhancements of a few thousand kelvin close to the\nclassical temperature minimum, but localised peak temperatures of up to\n10,000-15,000 K from Ca II inversions. Including Mg II generally dampens these\ntemperature enhancements to below 8000 K, while Si IV requires temperatures in\nexcess of 10,000 K at low heights, but may also be reproduced with secondary\ntemperature enhancements of 35,000-60,000 K higher up.

The spectrum of\ncovariance matrices from power data exhibits two aspects: 1) bulk, which arises\nfrom random noise or fluctuations and 2) spikes, which represents factors\ncaused by anomaly events. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the\nestimation of high-dimensional factor models, minimizing the distance between\nthe empirical spectral density (ESD) of covariance matrices of the residuals of\npower data that are obtained by subtracting principal components and the\nlimiting spectral density (LSD) from a multiplicative covariance structure\nmodel. The free probability theory (FPT) is used to derive the spectral density\nof the multiplicative covariance model, which efficiently solves the\ncomputational difficulties. The proposed approach connects the estimation of\nthe number of factors to the LSD of covariance matrices of the residuals, which\nprovides estimators of the number of factors and the correlation structure\ninformation in the residuals. Considering a lot of measurement noise is\ncontained in the power data and the correlation structure is complex for the\nresiduals, the approach prefers approaching the ESD of covariance matrices of\nthe residuals through a multiplicative covariance model, which avoids making\ncrude assumptions or simplifications on the complex structure of the data.\nTheoretical studies show the proposed approach is robust against noise and\nsensitive to the presence of weak factors. The synthetic data from IEEE 118-bus\npower system is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach.\nFurthermore, the application to the analysis of the real-world online\nmonitoring data in a power grid shows that the estimators in the approach can\nbe used to indicate the system behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 14:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2019 04:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

We use\nan isothermal equilibrium chemistry model to predict the transmission spectrum\nfor each of the neutral and singly-ionized atoms with atomic numbers between 3\nand 78.

The protocols achieving\nthe best compression use many more qubits of shared entanglement than the\nnumber of qubits in the states in the ensemble. Other compression protocols,\nwith potentially larger communication cost, have entanglement cost bounded by\nthe number of qubits in the given states. This motivates the question as to\nwhether entanglement is truly necessary for compression, and if so, how much of\nit is needed.\n  Motivated by questions in communication complexity, we lift certain\nrestrictions that are placed on compression protocols in tasks such as\nstate-splitting and channel simulation. We show that an ensemble of the form\ndesigned by Jain, Radhakrishnan, and Sen (ICALP'03) saturates the known bounds\non the sum of communication and entanglement costs, even with the relaxed\ncompression protocols we study.\n  The ensemble and the associated one-way communication protocol have several\nremarkable properties. The ensemble is incompressible by more than a constant\nnumber of qubits without shared entanglement, even when constant error is\nallowed. Moreover, in the presence of shared entanglement, the communication\ncost of compression can be arbitrarily smaller than the entanglement cost. The\nquantum information cost of the protocol can thus be arbitrarily smaller than\nthe cost of compression without shared entanglement. The ensemble can also be\nused to show the impossibility of reducing, via compression, the shared\nentanglement used in two-party protocols for computing Boolean functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 15:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 20:05:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 02:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

Adequate training data is the key to ensure the\neffectiveness of the deep models. However, obtaining valid data requires a lot\nof time and labor resources. Data augmentation (DA) is an effective alternative\napproach, which can generate new labeled data based on existing data using\nlabel-preserving transformations. Although we can benefit a lot from DA,\ndesigning appropriate DA policies requires a lot of expert experience and time\nconsumption, and the evaluation of searching the optimal policies is costly. So\nwe raise a new question in this paper: how to achieve automated data\naugmentation at as low cost as possible? We propose a method named BO-Aug for\nautomating the process by finding the optimal DA policies using the Bayesian\noptimization approach. Our method can find the optimal policies at a relatively\nlow search cost, and the searched policies based on a specific dataset are\ntransferable across different neural network architectures or even different\ndatasets. We validate the BO-Aug on three widely used image classification\ndatasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art or near advanced\nclassification accuracy.

Given $n$ workers, $f$ of which are arbitrary malicious\n(Byzantine) and $m=n-f$ are not, we prove that multi-Bulyan can ensure a strong\nform of Byzantine resilience, as well as an ${\\frac{m}{n}}$ slowdown, compared\nto averaging, the fastest (but non Byzantine resilient) rule for distributed\nmachine learning. When $m \\approx n$ (almost all workers are correct),\nmulti-Bulyan reaches the speed of averaging. We also prove that multi-Bulyan's\ncost in local computation is $O(d)$ (like averaging), an important feature for\nML where $d$ commonly reaches $10^9$, while robust alternatives have at least\nquadratic cost in $d$.\n  Our theoretical findings are complemented with an experimental evaluation\nwhich, in addition to supporting the linear $O(d)$ complexity argument, conveys\nthe fact that multi-Bulyan's parallelisability further adds to its efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 16:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 16:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

A special\nfeature of those games is the high variety of cards, which can be chosen by the\nplayers to create their own decks. In contrast to simpler card games, the value\nof many cards is determined by their possible synergies. The vast amount of\npossible decks, the randomness of the game, as well as the restricted\ninformation during the player's turn offer quite a hard challenge for the\ndevelopment of game-playing agents.

In\ncontrast to commonly used synchronous, frame-based vision systems and CNNs,\nasynchronous, spiking neural networks driven by event-based visual input\nrespond with low latency to sparse, salient features in the input, leading to\nhigh efficiency at run-time. The discrete nature of the event-based data\nstreams makes direct training of asynchronous neural networks challenging. This\npaper studies asynchronous spiking neural networks, obtained by conversion from\na conventional CNN trained on frame-based data. As an example, we consider a\nCNN trained to steer a robot to follow a moving target. We identify possible\npitfalls of the conversion and demonstrate how the proposed solutions bring the\nclassification accuracy of the asynchronous network to only 3\\% below the\nperformance of the original synchronous CNN, while requiring 12x fewer\ncomputations. While being applied to a simple task, this work is an important\nstep towards low-power, fast, and embedded neural networks-based vision\nsolutions for robotic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 12:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}
