Despite this resemblance, the 2-ECSS\nproblem is considerably more complex than MST. While MST admits a linear-time\ncentralized exact algorithm, 2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best known centralized\napproximation algorithm for it (that runs in polynomial time) gives a\n$2$-approximation.\n  In this paper, we give a deterministic distributed algorithm with round\ncomplexity of $\\widetilde{O}(D+\\sqrt{n})$ that computes a\n$(5+\\epsilon)$-approximation of 2-ECSS, for any constant $\\epsilon>0$.

The principal\nchallenge of numerical integration of nonlocal systems stems from the lack of\nspatial regularity of the data and solutions intrinsic to nonlocal models. To\novercome this problem we propose a semidiscrete numerical scheme based on the\ncombination of sparse Monte Carlo and discontinuous Galerkin methods.

Sparse sampling of points in the\nMonte Carlo approximation of the nonlocal term allows to use fewer\ndiscretization points without compromising the accuracy.\n  We prove convergence of the numerical method and estimate the rate of\nconvergence.

While\nparameter learning in SPNs is well developed, structure learning leaves\nsomething to be desired: Even though there is a plethora of SPN structure\nlearners, most of them are somewhat ad-hoc and based on intuition rather than a\nclear learning principle. In this paper, we introduce a well-principled\nBayesian framework for SPN structure learning. First, we decompose the problem\ninto i) laying out a computational graph, and ii) learning the so-called scope\nfunction over the graph. The first is rather unproblematic and akin to neural\nnetwork architecture validation. The second represents the effective structure\nof the SPN and needs to respect the usual structural constraints in SPN, i.e.\ncompleteness and decomposability. While representing and learning the scope\nfunction is somewhat involved in general, in this paper, we propose a natural\nparametrisation for an important and widely used special case of SPNs. These\nstructural parameters are incorporated into a Bayesian model, such that\nsimultaneous structure and parameter learning is cast into monolithic Bayesian\nposterior inference. In various experiments, our Bayesian SPNs often improve\ntest likelihoods over greedy SPN learners. Further, since the Bayesian\nframework protects against overfitting, we can evaluate hyper-parameters\ndirectly on the Bayesian model score, waiving the need for a separate\nvalidation set, which is especially beneficial in low data regimes. Bayesian\nSPNs can be applied to heterogeneous domains and can easily be extended to\nnonparametric formulations. Moreover, our Bayesian approach is the first, which\nconsistently and robustly learns SPN structures under missing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2019 21:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 13:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

In general, even for a system\nwith a finite Hilbert space dimension $D$, the pure state trajectory will\nexplore an infinite number of points in Hilbert space, meaning that the\ndimension $K$ of the classical memory required for the tracking is infinite.\nHowever, Karasik and Wiseman [Phys.

Lett., 106(2):020406, 2011] showed\nthat tracking of a qubit ($D=2$) is always possible with a bit ($K=2$), and\ngave a heuristic argument implying that a finite $K$ should be sufficient for\nany $D$, although beyond $D=2$ it would be necessary to have $K>D$. Our paper\nis concerned with rigorously investigating the relationship between $D$ and\n$K_{\\rm min}$, the smallest feasible $K$. We confirm the long-standing\nconjecture of Karasik and Wiseman that, for generic systems with $D>2$, $K_{\\rm\nmin}>D$, by a computational proof (via Hilbert Nullstellensatz certificates of\ninfeasibility).

Moreover,\nwe develop, and better justify, a new heuristic to guide our expectation of\n$K_{\\rm min}$ as a function of $D$, taking into account the number $L$ of\nLindblad operators as well as symmetries in the problem. The use of invariant\nsubspace and Wigner symmetries makes it tractable to conduct a numerical\nsearch, using the method of polynomial homotopy continuation, to find finite\nphysically realizable ensembles (as they are known) in $D=3$. The results of\nthis search support our heuristic. We thus have confidence in the most\ninteresting feature of our heuristic: in the absence of symmetries, $K_{\\rm\nmin} \\sim D^2$, implying a quadratic gap between the classical and quantum\ntracking problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 02:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 04:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

To tackle this problem, we investigate the expressive\npower of graph NNs via their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size tends to\ninfinity. Our strategy is to generalize the forward propagation of a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN), which is a popular graph NN variant, as a specific\ndynamical system. In the case of a GCN, we show that when its weights satisfy\nthe conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized\nLaplacian, its output exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry\ninformation of the connected components and node degrees only for\ndistinguishing nodes.

To demonstrate this, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of\nGCNs on the Erd\\H{o}s -- R\\'{e}nyi graph.

However, their fixed architecture, substantial\ntraining cost, and significant model redundancy make it difficult to\nefficiently update them to accommodate previously unseen data. To solve these\nproblems, we propose an incremental learning framework based on a\ngrow-and-prune neural network synthesis paradigm. When new data arrive, the\nneural network first grows new connections based on the gradients to increase\nthe network capacity to accommodate new data. Then, the framework iteratively\nprunes away connections based on the magnitude of weights to enhance network\ncompactness, and hence recover efficiency. Finally, the model rests at a\nlightweight DNN that is both ready for inference and suitable for future\ngrow-and-prune updates. The proposed framework improves accuracy, shrinks\nnetwork size, and significantly reduces the additional training cost for\nincoming data compared to conventional approaches, such as training from\nscratch and network fine-tuning. For the LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 neural\nnetwork architectures derived for the MNIST dataset, the framework reduces\ntraining cost by up to 64% (63%) and 67% (63%) compared to training from\nscratch (network fine-tuning), respectively. For the ResNet-18 architecture\nderived for the ImageNet dataset and DeepSpeech2 for the AN4 dataset, the\ncorresponding training cost reductions against training from scratch (network\nfine-tunning) are 64% (60%) and 67% (62%), respectively.

Despite\ntremendous efforts, it remains elusive to clearly identify these distinct\nMajorana excitations in experiments. Here we show their manifestation in the\ntime evolution after quenching the magnetic field, by using the time-dependent\nMajorana mean-field theory for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nKitaev models. We find that the transient spin dynamics from the quantum spin\nliquid states is qualitatively different from the conventional spin precessions\nby the quench from the high-field forced-ferromagnetic state. We obtain\npeculiar time evolutions with distinct time scales, i.e., short-time decay of\nhigh-energy components associated with the itinerant Majorana excitations, and\nlong-lived excitations at a low energy by the localized ones. These peculiar\nbehaviors are caused by the energy transfer between the two Majorana\nquasiparticles after the field quench. Moreover, we find that the Majorana\nsemimetal with the point nodes in equilibrium turns into a Majorana metal with\nthe transient \"Fermi surfaces\" by the energy transfer. In particular, for the\nquench from the intermediate-field quantum spin liquid in the antiferromagnetic\nKitaev model, the Fermi surfaces change their topology in the time evolution,\nwhich is regarded as a dynamical version of the Majorana \"Lifshitz transition\".\nOur results unveil that the real-time dynamics provides another route to not\nonly the identification of the fractional Majorana excitations in candidate\nmaterials of Kitaev magnets but also unprecedented quantum phases that cannot\nbe stabilized as the equilibrium states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 05:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Our technique is applied individually to all entries of the\nto-be-compressed update vector and works by randomized rounding to the nearest\n(negative or positive) power of two, which can be computed in a \"natural\" way\nby ignoring the mantissa. We show that compared to no compression, NC increases\nthe second moment of the compressed vector by not more than the tiny factor\n$\\frac{9}{8}$, which means that the effect of NC on the convergence speed of\npopular training algorithms, such as distributed SGD, is negligible. However,\nthe communications savings enabled by NC are substantial, leading to\n$3$-$4\\times$ improvement in overall theoretical running time. For applications\nrequiring more aggressive compression, we generalize NC to natural dithering,\nwhich we prove is exponentially better than the common random dithering\ntechnique. Our compression operators can be used on their own or in combination\nwith existing operators for a more aggressive combined effect and offer new\nstate-of-the-art both in theory and practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 06:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 06:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 07:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In simulations, there often is a need to vary these\nparameters to examine the behavior of a fluid-structure interaction model for\ndifferent solids and different fluids. For instance, a shipping company wants\nto know how the material, a ship's hull is made of, interacts with fluids at\ndifferent Reynolds and Strouhal numbers before the building process takes\nplace. Also, the behavior of such models for solids with different properties\nis considered before the prototype phase. A parameter-dependent linear\nfluid-structure interaction discretization provides approximations for a bundle\nof different parameters at one step. Such a discretization with respect to\ndifferent material parameters leads to a big block-diagonal system matrix that\nis equivalent to a matrix equation as discussed in [KressnerTobler 2011].

However, such a metric is\ninvariant under any permutation of the estimations of the powers of individual\nfrequency components on a predefined grid. This erases the order structure\ninherent in the spectrum which is also an important aspect of irregularity of\nthe signal. To disentangle the order structure and extract meaningful\ninformation from raw digital signal, novel analysis method is necessary.\nApproach: A novel method to depict the order structure by simply ranking power\nestimations on frequency grid of a evenly spaced signal is proposed. Two\ndescriptors mapping real- and vector-valued power spectrum estimation of a\nsignal into scalar value are defined in a heuristic manner. By definition, the\nproposed descriptor is capable of distinguishing signals with identical\nspectrum entropies. Main Results: The proposed descriptor showed its potential\nin diverse problems.

We show that this is particularly important\nfor studying asymmetric carbon-based nanostructures, for which the\nNos\\'{e}-Hoover thermostat can produce artifacts leading to unphysical thermal\nrectification. Our findings are important to obtain correct results from\nmolecular dynamics simulations of nanoscale heat transport as the accuracy of\nthe interatomic potentials is rapidly improving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 07:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Through\ncareful modelling of the data distribution of normal samples, it is possible to\ndetect deviant samples, so called anomalies. Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) can model the highly complex, high-dimensional data distribution of\nnormal image samples, and have shown to be a suitable approach to the problem.\nPreviously published GAN-based anomaly detection methods often assume that\nanomaly-free data is available for training.

In this work, we\nevaluate the effects of anomaly contaminations in the training data on\nstate-of-the-art GAN-based anomaly detection methods. As expected, detection\nperformance deteriorates. To address this performance drop, we propose to add\nan additional encoder network already at training time and show that joint\ngenerator-encoder training stratifies the latent space, mitigating the problem\nwith contaminated data. We show experimentally that the norm of a query image\nin this stratified latent space becomes a highly significant cue to\ndiscriminate anomalies from normal data.

The\nmain challenge in proving these claims is that self organization cannot be\ndetected through direct observation, but through measurements on the system,\nlooking for hints such as the existence of power laws over some features, such\nas the size of changes over time. The problem we intend to tackle in this paper\nis to establish a methodology for checking, for a chosen set of repositories we\nhad already measured in the past, if the claims about power laws actually hold\nfrom a precise mathematical point of view, since, although shown as pervasive\nin the software engineering literature (and others), power laws are more\nelusive than they might seem at first sight. For that reason, in this paper we\npresent a statistically accurate set of tests that will help us decide, from\nthe way repositories are changing, if they are really distributed by a power\nlaw, which could indicate us the existence of a state reached via\nself-organization, or actually, how accurately a power law fits the observed\ndistribution of the size of changes of commits in git repositories of 16 open\nsource repositories.

Second, if a service is not tied to its resources through\nnotification constructs, the system may operate in a stale state whenever a\nresource gets modified.

The recent\nsuccess of machine learning, especially deep learning in areas such as computer\nvision and natural language processing, has attracted a lot of attention from\nthe community of computational mathematics and inspired many intriguing works\nin combining machine learning with traditional methods. In this paper, we are\nthe first to view numerical PDE solvers as an MDP and to use (deep) RL to learn\nnew solvers. As proof of concept, we focus on 1-dimensional scalar conservation\nlaws. We deploy the machinery of deep reinforcement learning to train a policy\nnetwork that can decide on how the numerical solutions should be approximated\nin a sequential and spatial-temporal adaptive manner. We will show that the\nproblem of solving conservation laws can be naturally viewed as a sequential\ndecision-making process, and the numerical schemes learned in such a way can\neasily enforce long-term accuracy. Furthermore, the learned policy network is\ncarefully designed to determine a good local discrete approximation based on\nthe current state of the solution, which essentially makes the proposed method\na meta-learning approach. In other words, the proposed method is capable of\nlearning how to discretize for a given situation mimicking human experts.\nFinally, we will provide details on how the policy network is trained, how well\nit performs compared with some state-of-the-art numerical solvers such as WENO\nschemes, and supervised learning based approach L3D and PINN, and how well it\ngeneralizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 09:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 15:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 03:45:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 03:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

In the\nlong-time limit, the scalar concentration takes the same, predictable form for\nalmost all realisations of the flow, with a Gaussian core characterised by an\neffective diffusivity, and large-deviation tails characterised by a rate\nfunction (which can be evaluated by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent of\na family of random-in-time partial differential equations).

Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC)\nsuffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates\ndemonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error\naccumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as\ninverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this\nissue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon.\nSince the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a\nreward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle\napproximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple\nalternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward\nfunction. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the\ndemonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated\nstates upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by\ngiving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action\nin a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior.\nOur method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented\nwith a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy\nactor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as\na regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage\nlong-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and\nachieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and\nlow-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 10:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 08:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Conceptually, humans are\nreadily able to understand new concepts given just a few examples, while in\nmore pragmatic terms, limited-example training situations are common in\npractice. Recent effective approaches to few-shot learning employ a\nmetric-learning framework to learn a feature similarity comparison between a\nquery (test) example, and the few support (training) examples. However, these\napproaches treat each support class independently from one another, never\nlooking at the entire task as a whole.

In this work, we consider a two dimensional\nsystem with a large Rashba-type SOC and exchange field in the case where only\none band is partially occupied. We develop a generalized quasiclassical theory\nby projecting the Green function onto the partially occupied band (POB). We\nfind that when the SOC energy scale is comparable with the exchange field,\nthere is no LRPE. The reason is that the nonmagnetic impurities together with\nthe large SOC and exchange field can effectively generate spin-flip scattering,\nwhich suppresses the proximity effect. We also show that when increasing either\nSOC or exchange field, the decay length of superconducting correlations can be\nsignificantly increased due to an approximately restored time reversal symmetry\nor spin rotation symmetry around the $z$ (out-of-plane) axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 11:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Such applications demand the use of short channel graphene\ntransistors that operate at high electric fields in order to ensure a high\nspeed. Electric field is inversely proportional to device length and\nproportional to channel potential so it gets maximized as the drain voltage\nincreases and the transistor length shrinks. Under these conditions though,\nshort channel effects like Velocity Saturation (VS) should be taken into\naccount. Carrier number and mobility fluctuations have been proved to be the\nmain sources that generate LFN in graphene devices. While their contribution to\nthe bias dependence of LFN in long channels has been thoroughly investigated,\nthe way in which VS phenomenon affects LFN in short channel devices under high\ndrain voltage conditions has not been well understood. At low electric field\noperation, VS effect is negligible since carriers velocity is far away from\nbeing saturated. Under these conditions, LFN can be precicely predicted by a\nrecently established physics-based analytical model. The present paper goes a\nstep furher and proposes a new model which deals with the contribution of VS\neffect on LFN under high electric field conditions. The implemented model is\nvalidated with novel experimental data, published for the first time, from CVD\ngrown back-gated single layer graphene transistors operating at gigahertz\nfrequencies. The model accurately captures the reduction of LFN especially near\ncharge neutrality point because of the effect of VS mechanism. Moreover, an\nanalytical expression for the effect of contact resistance on LFN is derived.\nThis contact resistance contribution is experimentally shown to be dominant at\nhigher gate voltages and is accurately described by the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 12:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

The recently proposed deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have been used for policy optimization.\nHowever, these deep models are still challenging for two reasons: 1) Many\nDRL-based policies are not sample-efficient. 2) Most models don't have the\ncapability of policy transfer between different domains. In this paper, we\npropose a universal framework, AgentGraph, to tackle these two problems. The\nproposed AgentGraph is the combination of GNN-based architecture and DRL-based\nalgorithm. It can be regarded as one of the multi-agent reinforcement learning\napproaches. Each agent corresponds to a node in a graph, which is defined\naccording to the dialogue domain ontology. When making a decision, each agent\ncan communicate with its neighbors on the graph. Under AgentGraph framework, we\nfurther propose Dual GNN-based dialogue policy, which implicitly decomposes the\ndecision in each turn into a high-level global decision and a low-level local\ndecision. Experiments show that AgentGraph models significantly outperform\ntraditional reinforcement learning approaches on most of the 18 tasks of the\nPyDial benchmark.

In analogy to common\nfingerprints, we show that these two-dimensional instability-precursor\nsignatures may be used to reconstruct the full mechanical response of unknown\nsample microstructures; this feat is achieved by reconstructing appropriate\naverage behaviors with the assistance of a deep convolutional neural network\nthat is fine-tuned for image recognition. We demonstrate basic aspects of\nmicrostructural fingerprinting in a toy model of dislocation plasticity and\nthen, we illustrate the method's scalability and robustness in phase field\nsimulations of model binary alloys under mode-I fracture loading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 15:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 14:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 23:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

This model captures\nthe heavy flavour spectroscopy of masses and decay constants in the vacuum\n(zero temperature) and is consistently extended to finite temperature. The\nspectral functions that emerge provide a description of the dissociation\nprocess in terms of the broadening of the quasi-state peaks with temperature.\n  The holographic approach makes it possible to determine also the quasinormal\nmodes.

The\nperformance-complexity tradeoff and the performance-delay tradeoff can be\nachieved by adjusting the statistical threshold and the decoding window size.\nTo analyze the performance, a closed-form upper bound and a simulated lower\nbound are derived. Simulation results verify our analysis and show that: 1) The\nproposed list decoding algorithm with empirical divergence test outperforms the\nsequential decoding in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region; 2) Taking the\ntail-biting convolutional codes (TBCC) as the basic codes, the proposed list\ndecoding of SRUMCCs have comparable performance with the polar codes under the\nconstraint of equivalent decoding delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 10:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 01:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

This common practice requires sending\nprivate and privileged data over the network to remote servers, exposing it to\nthe service provider and potentially compromising its privacy. Even if the\nprovider is trusted, the data can still be vulnerable over communication\nchannels or via side-channel attacks in the cloud. To that end, this paper aims\nto reduce the information content of the communicated data with as little as\npossible compromise on the inference accuracy by making the sent data noisy. An\nundisciplined addition of noise can significantly reduce the accuracy of\ninference, rendering the service unusable. To address this challenge, this\npaper devises Shredder, an end-to-end framework, that, without altering the\ntopology or the weights of a pre-trained network, learns additive noise\ndistributions that significantly reduce the information content of communicated\ndata while maintaining the inference accuracy. The key idea is finding the\nadditive noise distributions by casting it as a disjoint offline learning\nprocess with a loss function that strikes a balance between accuracy and\ninformation degradation. The loss function also exposes a knob for a\ndisciplined and controlled asymmetric trade-off between privacy and accuracy.\nExperimentation with six real-world DNNs from text processing and image\nclassification shows that Shredder reduces the mutual information between the\ninput and the communicated data to the cloud by 74.70% compared to the original\nexecution while only sacrificing 1.58% loss in accuracy.

With these modifications the flow solver appears\nas accurate as the HLLC solver of Toro et al. (1994). Second the two-phase flow\nmodel is considered. A locally conservative formulation is built and validated\nremoving issues related to non-conservative terms. However, two extra major\nissues appear from numerical experiments: The solution appears not self-similar\nand multiple contact waves appear in the dispersed phase. Building HLLC-type or\nany other solver appears consequently challenging. The modified Linde (2002)\nmethod is thus examined for the considered flow model. Some basic properties of\nthe equations are used, such as shock relations of the dispersed phase and jump\nconditions across the contact wave. Thanks to these ingredients the new Riemann\nsolver with internal reconstruction (RSIR), modification of the Linde method,\nhandles stationary volume fraction discontinuities, presents low dissipation\nfor transport waves and handles shocks and expansion waves accurately. It is\nvalidated on various test problems showing method's accuracy and versatility\nfor complex flow models. Its capabilities are illustrated on a difficult\ntwo-phase flow instability problem, unresolved before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 07:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Differently from classical finite element\nmethods, where the relation between the geometric properties of the mesh and\nthe performances of the solver are well known, the characterization of a good\npolytopal element is still subject to ongoing research. Current shape\nregularity criteria are quite restrictive, and greatly limit the set of valid\nmeshes. Nevertheless, numerical experiments revealed that PEM solvers can\nperform well on meshes that are far outside the strict boundaries imposed by\nthe current theory, suggesting that the real capabilities of these methods are\nmuch higher. In this work, we propose a benchmark to study the correlation\nbetween general 2D polygonal meshes and PEM solvers. The benchmark aims to\nexplore the space of 2D polygonal meshes and polygonal quality metrics, in\norder to identify weaker shape-regularity criteria under which the considered\nmethods can reliably work. The proposed tool is quite general, and can be\npotentially used to study any PEM solver. Besides discussing the basics of the\nbenchmark, in the second part of the paper we demonstrate its application on a\nrepresentative member of the PEM family, namely the Virtual Element Method,\nalso discussing our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 09:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

There are three\ndevices involved in an RFID protocol: a Reader, a Tag, and a back-end Database.\nOne of the key factors for the RFID technology is that, in order to be used on\nlarge scale, the price of the Tags has to be cheap: it cannot be expensive\nbecause who is supposed to use it would need a great amount of them,\nfurthermore, Tags must have very small dimensions. The low-cost nature of such\ndevices implies the impossibility to use standard cryptographic protocols on\nthem, furthermore, Ultra-Lightweight Tags even lack the necessary computational\npower to generate random numbers. Many experts are trying to build secure\nprotocols that involve just simple bitwise logical operations for these Tags,\nbut, unfortunately, each of these protocols turned out to be vulnerable to some\nserious attack after short time from publication. The need for a secure RFID\nauthentication protocol today seems more urgent than ever, because this\ntechnology is already used for security purposes, such as electronic passports.\nThe challenge to build a secure protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems is\nso hard that in several years no one has been able to build one. In this thesis\nwe analyze in great detail a recently proposed protocol for Ultra-Lightweight\nRFID systems called SLAP, with the aim of finding new vulnerabilities. SLAP has\nalready been violated (along with a set of similar protocols) by Safkhani and\nBagheri, that have recently published a de-synchronization attack. At the end\nof our analysis, we will propose an impersonification attack to the protocol,\nalong with a fix for our attack and some considerations on the attacks proposed\non this kind of protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 13:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

In the first stage, we estimate\npseudo-labels for the examples in the target domain using an external\nunsupervised domain adaptation algorithm---for example, MSTN or\nCPUA---integrating the proposed domain-specific batch normalization. The second\nstage learns the final models using a multi-task classification loss for the\nsource and target domains.

Our framework can be easily incorporated\ninto the domain adaptation techniques based on deep neural networks with batch\nnormalization layers.

However, the increasing depth and width of such models also lead\nto explosive growth in both storage and computation, which has restricted the\ndeployment of deep neural networks on resource-limited edge devices. To address\nthis problem, we propose the so-called SCAN framework for networks training and\ninference, which is orthogonal and complementary to existing acceleration and\ncompression methods. The proposed SCAN firstly divides neural networks into\nmultiple sections according to their depth and constructs shallow classifiers\nupon the intermediate features of different sections. Moreover, attention\nmodules and knowledge distillation are utilized to enhance the accuracy of\nshallow classifiers. Based on this architecture, we further propose a threshold\ncontrolled scalable inference mechanism to approach human-like sample-specific\ninference. Experimental results show that SCAN can be easily equipped on\nvarious neural networks without any adjustment on hyper-parameters or neural\nnetworks architectures, yielding significant performance gain on CIFAR100 and\nImageNet.

A general three-body configuration is\nset by three \"radial\" and three angular variables, which determine the shape\nand orientation, respectively, of a triangle with the three bodies located at\nthe vertices. The radial variables are given by the distances between a\nreference body and the other two, and by the angle at the reference body\nbetween the other two. Such radial variables set the potential energy of the\nsystem, and they are reminiscent of the inter-body distance in the two-body\nproblem.
