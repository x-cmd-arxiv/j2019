Utilizing the\ninsulator-to-metal transition of VO2, the amplitude of EIT peak can be actively\nmodulated with a significant modulation depth. Meanwhile the group delay within\nthe transparent window can also be dynamically tuned, achieving the active\ncontrol of slow light effect. Furthermore, we also introduce independently\ntunable transparent peaks as well as group delay based on a double-peak EIT\nwith good tuning performance. Finally, based on broadband EIT, the active\ntuning of quality factor of the EIT peak is also realized. This work introduces\nactive EIT control with more degree of freedom by employing VO2, and can find\npotential applications in future wireless and ultrafast THz communication\nsystems as multi-channel filters, switches, spacers, logic gates and\nmodulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 16:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid precoder\nimplementation, namely the double phase shifter (DPS) implementation, which\nenables highly tractable hybrid precoder design. Efficient algorithms are then\ndeveloped for two popular hybrid precoder structures, i.e., the fully- and\npartially-connected structures. For the fully-connected one, the RF-only\nprecoding and hybrid precoding problems are formulated as a least absolute\nshrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem and a low-rank matrix\napproximation problem, respectively. In this way, computationally efficient\nalgorithms are provided to approach the performance of the fully digital one\nwith a small number of radio frequency (RF) chains. On the other hand, the\nhybrid precoder design in the partially-connected structure is identified as an\neigenvalue problem. To enhance the performance of this cost-effective\nstructure, dynamic mapping from RF chains to antennas is further proposed, for\nwhich a greedy algorithm and a modified K-means algorithm are developed.\nSimulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed hybrid\nprecoding algorithms over existing ones. It shows that, with the proposed DPS\nimplementation, the fully-connected structure enjoys both satisfactory\nperformance and low design complexity while the partially-connected one serves\nas an economic solution with low hardware complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 16:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology\nof the data.

Alternatively, the mixing\nprobabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or\nmore complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these\napproaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to\ncomplicated or intractable inference.

Network\nembedding models are powerful tools in mapping nodes in a network into\ncontinuous vector-space representations in order to facilitate subsequent tasks\nsuch as classification and link prediction. Existing network embedding models\ncomprehensively integrate all information of each node, such as links and\nattributes, towards a single embedding vector to represent the node's general\nrole in the network. However, a real-world entity could be multifaceted, where\nit connects to different neighborhoods due to different motives or\nself-characteristics that are not necessarily correlated. For example, in a\nmovie recommender system, a user may love comedies or horror movies\nsimultaneously, but it is not likely that these two types of movies are\nmutually close in the embedding space, nor the user embedding vector could be\nsufficiently close to them at the same time.

This is why in the\npast year model stores have been introduced, which, similar to mobile app\nstores, offer organizations and developers access to pre-trained models and/or\ntheir code to train, evaluate, and predict samples. This paper conducts an\nexploratory study on three popular model stores (AWS marketplace, Wolfram\nneural net repository, and ModelDepot) that compares the information elements\n(features and policies) provided by model stores to those used by the two\npopular mobile app stores (Google Play and Apple's App Store). We have found\nthat the model information elements vary among the different model stores, with\n65% elements shared by all three studied stores. Model stores share five\ninformation elements with mobile app stores, while eight elements are unique to\nmodel stores and four elements unique to app stores. Only few models were\navailable on multiple model stores. Our findings allow to better understand the\ndifferences between ML models and \"regular\" source code components or\napplications, and provide inspiration to identify software engineering\npractices (e.g., in requirements and delivery) specific to ML applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 21:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 20:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

We\nconduct an extensive analysis on different modalities and various aspects of\nmulti-model dynamic saliency prediction.

One scheme of learning attacks is to design a\nproper adversarial objective function that leads to the imperceptible\nperturbation for any test image (e.g., the Carlini-Wagner (C&W) method). Most\nmethods address targeted attacks in the Top-1 manner. In this paper, we propose\nto learn ordered Top-k attacks (k>= 1) for image classification tasks, that is\nto enforce the Top-k predicted labels of an adversarial example to be the k\n(randomly) selected and ordered labels (the ground-truth label is exclusive).\nTo this end, we present an adversarial distillation framework: First, we\ncompute an adversarial probability distribution for any given ordered Top-k\ntargeted labels with respect to the ground-truth of a test image. Then, we\nlearn adversarial examples by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\ntogether with the perturbation energy penalty, similar in spirit to the network\ndistillation method. We explore how to leverage label semantic similarities in\ncomputing the targeted distributions, leading to knowledge-oriented attacks. In\nexperiments, we thoroughly test Top-1 and Top-5 attacks in the ImageNet-1000\nvalidation dataset using two popular DNNs trained with clean ImageNet-1000\ntrain dataset, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121. For both models, our proposed\nadversarial distillation approach outperforms the C&W method in the Top-1\nsetting, as well as other baseline methods. Our approach shows significant\nimprovement in the Top-5 setting against a strong modified C&W method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 23:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

Relational learning models enable the prediction\nof missing links inside knowledge graphs. More specifically, latent distance\napproaches model the relationships among entities via a distance between latent\nrepresentations. Translating embedding models (e.g., TransE) are among the most\npopular latent distance approaches which use one distance function to learn\nmultiple relation patterns. However, they are mostly inefficient in capturing\nsymmetric relations since the representation vector norm for all the symmetric\nrelations becomes equal to zero. They also lose information when learning\nrelations with reflexive patterns since they become symmetric and transitive.\nWe propose the Multiple Distance Embedding model (MDE) that addresses these\nlimitations and a framework to collaboratively combine variant latent\ndistance-based terms. Our solution is based on two principles: 1) we use a\nlimit-based loss instead of a margin ranking loss and, 2) by learning\nindependent embedding vectors for each of the terms we can collectively train\nand predict using contradicting distance terms. We further demonstrate that MDE\nallows modeling relations with (anti)symmetry, inversion, and composition\npatterns. We propose MDE as a neural network model that allows us to map\nnon-linear relations between the embedding vectors and the expected output of\nthe score function.

In addition to utilizing\nglobal image features, DISN predicts the projected location for each 3D point\non the 2D image, and extracts local features from the image feature maps.\nCombining global and local features significantly improves the accuracy of the\nsigned distance field prediction, especially for the detail-rich areas.

However, little is known about\ninfluences of the SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH\nshadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly taking into account the SSA-thick\nregion. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH shadow image\nshows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of\nthe SSA-thick ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the\nframe-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime. As a result, we find that a\ndark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring and the\nSSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent\nincrease with BH spin: its width reaches up to $\\sim 2$ gravitational radius\nwhen the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum value. The dark crescent is regarded\nas a new signature of a highly spinning BH.

Most deep models adopt\nquestion-answer interaction mechanisms, such as attention, to get vector\nrepresentations for answers. When these interaction based deep models are\ndeployed for online prediction, the representations of all answers need to be\nrecalculated for each question. This procedure is time-consuming for deep\nmodels with complex encoders like BERT which usually have better accuracy than\nsimple encoders. One possible solution is to store the matrix representation\n(encoder output) of each answer in memory to avoid recalculation. But this will\nbring large memory cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called\nhashing based answer selection (HAS), to tackle this problem. HAS adopts a\nhashing strategy to learn a binary matrix representation for each answer, which\ncan dramatically reduce the memory cost for storing the matrix representations\nof answers. Hence, HAS can adopt complex encoders like BERT in the model, but\nthe online prediction of HAS is still fast with a low memory cost.

In the experiment, it was shown that a Raman-induced\ntwo-dimensional SOC exists in the dressed-state basis close to a Dirac point of\nthe single-particle spectrum. By contrast, the short-range inter-atomic\ninteractions of the system are typically expressed in the hyperfine-spin basis.\nThe interplay between synthetic SOC and interactions can potentially lead to\ninteresting few- and many-body phenomena but has so far eluded theoretical\nattention.

We find that, due to the competition between SOC and interaction, the\nstability region of the two-body bound state is in general reduced.\nParticularly, the threshold of the lowest two-body bound state is shifted to a\npositive, SOC-dependent scattering length. Furthermore, the center-of-mass\nmomentum of the lowest two-body bound state becomes nonzero, suggesting the\nemergence of Fulde-Ferrell pairing states in a many-body setting.

Recently, several\nLipschitz-constraint-based methods have been explored. The satisfaction of\nLipschitz continuity guarantees a remarkable performance on a target domain.\nHowever, they lack a mathematical analysis of why a Lipschitz constraint is\nbeneficial to unsupervised domain adaptation and usually perform poorly on\nlarge-scale datasets. In this paper, we take the principle of utilizing a\nLipschitz constraint further by discussing how it affects the error bound of\nunsupervised domain adaptation. A connection between them is built and an\nillustration of how Lipschitzness reduces the error bound is presented. A\n\\textbf{local smooth discrepancy} is defined to measure Lipschitzness of a\ntarget distribution in a pointwise way. When constructing a deep end-to-end\nmodel, to ensure the effectiveness and stability of unsupervised domain\nadaptation, three critical factors are considered in our proposed optimization\nstrategy, i.e., the sample amount of a target domain, dimension and batchsize\nof samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on\nseveral standard benchmarks. Our ablation study shows that the sample amount of\na target domain, the dimension and batchsize of samples indeed greatly impact\nLipschitz-constraint-based methods' ability to handle large-scale datasets.\nCode is available at https://github.com/CuthbertCai/SRDA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2019 06:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 07:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 07:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 12:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

On the other hand, one of the greatest achievements\nof the OT literature in recent years lies in regularity theory: Caffarelli\nshowed that the OT map between two well behaved measures is Lipschitz, or\nequivalently when considering 2-Wasserstein distances, that Brenier convex\npotentials (whose gradient yields an optimal map) are smooth. We propose in\nthis work to draw inspiration from this theory and use regularity as a\nregularization tool. We give algorithms operating on two discrete measures that\ncan recover nearly optimal transport maps with small distortion, or\nequivalently, nearly optimal Brenier potentials that are strongly convex and\nsmooth. The problem boils down to solving alternatively a convex QCQP and a\ndiscrete OT problem, granting access to the values and gradients of the Brenier\npotential not only on sampled points, but also out of sample at the cost of\nsolving a simpler QCQP for each evaluation.

We\nprove the generalization abilities of Lipschitz regularized deep neural\nnetworks and show that by using those networks, a convergence to the best\npossible prediction strategy is guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2019 15:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

The purpose of\nargument search is the distillation of pro and contra arguments for requested\ntopics from large text corpora. In previous works, the usual approach is to use\na standard search engine to extract text parts which are relevant to the given\ntopic and subsequently use an argument recognition algorithm to select\narguments from them. The main challenge in the argument recognition task, which\nis also known as argument mining, is that often sentences containing arguments\nare structurally similar to purely informative sentences without any stance\nabout the topic. In fact, they only differ semantically. Most approaches use\ntopic or search term information only for the first search step and therefore\nassume that arguments can be classified independently of a topic. We argue that\ntopic information is crucial for argument mining, since the topic defines the\nsemantic context of an argument. Precisely, we propose different models for the\nclassification of arguments, which take information about a topic of an\nargument into account. Moreover, to enrich the context of a topic and to let\nmodels understand the context of the potential argument better, we integrate\ninformation from different external sources such as Knowledge Graphs or\npre-trained NLP models.

To\novercome these drawbacks, we aimed to predict Cc through other soil parameters,\ni.e., the liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), and initial void ratio (e0).\nUsing these parameters is more convenient and requires substantially less time\nand cost compared to the conventional tests to estimate Cc. This study presents\na novel prediction model for the Cc of fine-grained soils using gene expression\nprogramming (GEP). A database consisting of 108 different data points was used\nto develop the model. A closed-form equation solution was derived to estimate\nCc based on LL, PL, and e0. The performance of the developed GEP-based model\nwas evaluated through the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean\nsquared error (RMSE), and the mean average error (MAE). The proposed model\nperformed better in terms of R2, RMSE, and MAE compared to the other models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2019 07:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}
