This has motivated\nmany efforts on optimizing manipulation tasks involving a single arm.\nCoordinating multiple arms for manipulation, however, introduces additional\ncomputational challenges arising from the increased DoFs, as well as the\ncombinatorial increase in the available operations that many manipulators can\nperform, including handoffs between arms. The focus here is on the case of\npick-and-place tasks, which require a sequence of handoffs to be executed, so\nas to achieve computational efficiency, asymptotic optimality and practical\nanytime performance. The paper leverages recent advances in multi-robot motion\nplanning for high DoF systems to propose a novel multi-modal extension of the\ndRRT* algorithm. The key insight is that, instead of naively solving a sequence\nof motion planning problems, it is computationally advantageous to directly\nexplore the composite space of the integrated multi-arm task and motion\nplanning problem, given input sets of possible pick and handoff configurations.\nAsymptotic optimality guarantees are possible by sampling additional picks and\nhandoffs over time. The evaluation shows that the approach finds initial\nsolutions fast and improves their quality over time. It also succeeds in\nfinding solutions to harder problem instances relative to alternatives and can\nscale effectively as the number of robots increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 16:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

Until now,\nmessage logging MPI implementations have incurred the overheads of a redesign\nand redeployment of an MPI library, as well as continued performance penalties\nacross various kernels. Successful research efforts for message logging\nimplementations do exist, but not a single one of them can be easily deployed\ntoday by more than a few experts. In contrast, in this work we build efficient\nmessage logging capabilities on top of an MPI library with no message logging\ncapabilities; we do so for two different HPC kernels, one with a global\nexchange pattern (CG), and one with a neighbourhood exchange pattern (LULESH).\nWhile our library of choice ULFM detects failure and recovers MPI\ncommunicators, we build on that to then restore the intra- and inter-process\ndata consistency of both applications. This task turns out to be challenging,\nand we present the methodology for doing so in this work. In the end, we\nachieve message logging capabilities for each kernel, without the need for an\nactual message logging runtime underneath. On the performance side, we match\nstate-of-the-art solutions and (a) eliminate event logging and the event logger\ncomponent altogether, and (b) design a hybrid protocol, which gracefully shifts\nbetween global and local rollback, depending on the available payload logging\nmemory. Such a hybrid protocol between local and global rollback has not been\npreviously proposed to our knowledge. Our extensions span a few hundred lines\nof code for each kernel, are open-sourced, and enable local and global rollback\nafter process failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 16:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

Predictive modeling of clinical risk,\nincluding in-hospital mortality, hospital readmission, chronic disease onset,\ncondition exacerbation, etc., from patient EHR, is one of the health data\nanalytic problems that attract most of the interests.

In\nthis paper, we propose MetaPred, a meta-learning for clinical risk prediction\nfrom longitudinal patient EHRs.

The statistical framework presented is used to estimate\nfailure probabilities across temperatures in ferritic steels. The framework has\nthe capability to estimate the three statistical parameters present in the\nWeibull-type model without any prior assumptions. The calibration against\nexperimental data shows important differences in the values obtained for strain\ngradient plasticity and conventional J2 plasticity. Moreover, local probability\nmaps show that potential damage initiation sites are much closer to the crack\ntip in the case of gradient-enhanced plasticity. Finally, the fracture response\nacross the ductile-to-brittle regime is investigated by computing the cleavage\nresistance curves with increasing temperature. Gradient plasticity predictions\nappear to show a better agreement with the experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 17:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

A new physical quantity called Liutex (previously named Rortex) has\nbeen defined as the rigid rotation part of fluid motion. From DNS and\nexperiment, forest of hairpin vortices has been found in flow transition and\nlow Reynolds turbulence, but more and more one leg vortices appear in fully\ndeveloped turbulence. This letter shows hairpin vortex is unstable. Hairpin\nvortex will weaken or lose one leg by the shear and vortex interaction. This\nconclusion is made by Liutex definition and mathematical analysis without any\nphysical assumptions. The asymmetry of vortex is caused by the interaction of\nsymmetric shear and symmetric Liutex due to the definition of Liutex, which\nconsiders the smaller element of a pair of vorticity elements as the rotational\nstrength. For a 2-D fluid rotation, if a disturbance shear effects the larger\nelement, the rotation strength will not be changed, but if the disturbance\nshear effects the smaller element, the rotation strength will be immediate\nchanged due to the Liutex strength definition. For a rigid rotation, if both\nvorticity of the shear and Liutex have the same directions, e.g., clockwise,\nthe Liutex strength will not be changed. If the vorticity of the shear and\nLiutex have different directions, e.g., one clockwise and one counterclockwise,\nthe Liutex strength will be weakened. Then, the hairpin vortex could lose the\nsymmetry and even deform to a one leg vortex. The one leg vortex cannot keep\nbalanced, and the chaotic motion and flow fluctuation are doomed. This is\nconsidered as the mathematical foundation of turbulence formation. This theory\nhas been checked and proved by our DNS results of boundary layer transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 17:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

The goal is to realize\ntimely delivery of fresh data over time, which is assessed by an\nage-of-information (AoI) metric. Channel coding is used to combat the channel\nerrors, and feedback is sent to acknowledge updates' reception. In case\ndecoding is unsuccessful, a hybrid ARQ protocol is employed, in which\nincremental redundancy (IR) bits are transmitted to enhance the decoding\nability. This continues for some amount of time in case decoding remains\nunsuccessful, after which a new (fresh) status update is transmitted instead.\nIn case decoding is successful, the transmitter has the option to idly wait for\na certain amount of time before sending a new update.

Stationary\ndeterministic policies are investigated, in which the codeword and IR lengths\nare fixed for each update, and the waiting time is a deterministic function of\nthe AoI. The optimal waiting policy is then derived, and is shown to have a\nthreshold structure, in which the transmitter sends a new update only if the\nAoI grows above a certain threshold that is a function of the codeword and IR\nlengths.

Previous approaches consider a parametric model of the human\nbody, SMPL, and attempt to regress the model parameters that give rise to a\nmesh consistent with image evidence. This parameter regression has been a very\nchallenging task, with model-based approaches underperforming compared to\nnonparametric solutions in terms of pose estimation. In our work, we propose to\nrelax this heavy reliance on the model's parameter space. We still retain the\ntopology of the SMPL template mesh, but instead of predicting model parameters,\nwe directly regress the 3D location of the mesh vertices. This is a heavy task\nfor a typical network, but our key insight is that the regression becomes\nsignificantly easier using a Graph-CNN. This architecture allows us to\nexplicitly encode the template mesh structure within the network and leverage\nthe spatial locality the mesh has to offer. Image-based features are attached\nto the mesh vertices and the Graph-CNN is responsible to process them on the\nmesh structure, while the regression target for each vertex is its 3D location.\nHaving recovered the complete 3D geometry of the mesh, if we still require a\nspecific model parametrization, this can be reliably regressed from the\nvertices locations. We demonstrate the flexibility and the effectiveness of our\nproposed graph-based mesh regression by attaching different types of features\non the mesh vertices. In all cases, we outperform the comparable baselines\nrelying on model parameter regression, while we also achieve state-of-the-art\nresults among model-based pose estimation approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 17:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

This time series encodes semantic information in a speaker-dependent\nway. An earlier paper showed how to use the sequence of sensor measurements to\nderive an \"inner\" time series that is unaffected by any previous invertible\ntransformation of the sensor measurements. The current paper considers two or\nmore speakers, who mimic one another in the following sense: when they say the\nsame words, they produce sensor states that are invertibly mapped onto one\nanother. It follows that the inner time series of their utterances must be the\nsame when they say the same words. In other words, the inner time series\nencodes their speech in a manner that is speaker-independent. Consequently, the\nASR training process can be simplified by collecting and labelling the inner\ntime series of the utterances of just one speaker, instead of training on the\nsensor time series of the utterances of a large variety of speakers. A similar\nargument suggests that the inner time series of music is\ninstrument-independent. This is demonstrated in experiments on monophonic\nelectronic music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 18:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

The difficulty stems from projection effects\nmeaning one must rely on statistical methods applied to galaxy samples to infer\nintrinsic shape distributions. Theoretical work using analytical galaxy\npotentials suggests a relationship between galaxy intrinsic shape (as defined\nby its \"triaxiality\", in practice a proxy for how prolate a galaxy is) and the\nintrinsic misalignment angle between kinematic and morphological axes\n($\\Psi_{\\rm int}$). This relationship reduces the number of unknowns, providing\nmore reliable inferred intrinsic shape distributions than methods using\nphotometry alone. Here we explore the connection between intrinsic shape and\nstellar kinematics using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the\nIllustris project. The strongest relationship we find is that galaxy intrinsic\nflattening is correlated with specific angular momentum (j) with high j\ngalaxies being flatter than galaxies with low specific angular momentum. Our\nanalysis shows that, although the majority of kinematically misaligned galaxies\nexhibit prolate shapes, examples of kinematically aligned prolate galaxies are\nalso present. Clearly a direct correspondence between prolate shape and\nminor-axis rotation (often referred to as \"prolate rotation\") is not present in\nIllustris. Thus, we demonstrate that the assumption of a simple relationship\nbetween $\\Psi_{\\rm int}$ and intrinsic shape commonly employed in shape\nrecovery studies is not valid for Illustris galaxies.

These effects violate\nlocality --material properties in the bulk may be strongly affected by the\nboundaries, leading to anomalous energy transport-- and they make more\nproblematic the interpretation of mechanical microscopic quantities in terms of\nthermodynamic observables.

A conventional WSI\nsystem scans the tissue slide to different positions and acquires the digital\nimages. In a typical implementation, a focus map is created prior to the\nscanning process, leading to significant overhead time and a necessity for high\npositional accuracy of the mechanical system. The resulting cost of WSI system\nis often prohibitive for frozen section procedure during surgery.\n  Methods: We report a novel WSI scheme based on a programmable LED array for\nsample illumination. In between two regular brightfield image acquisitions, we\nacquire one additional image by turning on a red and a green LED for color\nmultiplexed illumination. We then identify the translational shift of the red-\nand green-channel images by maximizing the image mutual information or\ncross-correlation. The resulting translational shift is used for dynamic focus\ncorrection in the scanning process. Since we track the differential focus\nduring adjacent acquisitions, there is no positional repeatability requirement\nin our scheme.\n  Results: We demonstrate a prototype WSI platform with a mean focusing error\nof ~0.3 microns. Different from previous implementations, this prototype\nplatform requires no focus map surveying, no secondary camera or additional\noptics, and allows for continuous sample motion in the focus tracking process.\n  Conclusions: A programmable LED array can be used for color-multiplexed\nsingle-shot autofocusing in WSI. The reported scheme may enable the development\nof cost-effective WSI platforms without positional repeatability requirement.\nIt may also provide a turnkey solution for other high-content microscopy\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 22:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

In AutoAssist,\nwe utilize this fact and design a simple instance shrinking operation, which is\nused to filter out instances with relatively low marginal improvement to the\ncurrent model; thus the computationally intensive gradient computations are\nperformed on informative instances as much as possible. We prove that the\nproposed technique outperforms vanilla SGD with existing importance sampling\napproaches for linear SVM problems, and establish an O(1/k) convergence for\nstrongly convex problems. In order to apply the proposed techniques to\naccelerate training of deep models, we propose to jointly train a very\nlightweight Assistant network in addition to the original deep network referred\nto as Boss. The Assistant network is designed to gauge the importance of a\ngiven instance with respect to the current Boss such that a shrinking operation\ncan be applied in the batch generator. With careful design, we train the Boss\nand Assistant in a nonblocking and asynchronous fashion such that overhead is\nminimal. We demonstrate that AutoAssist reduces the number of epochs by 40% for\ntraining a ResNet to reach the same test accuracy on an image classification\ndata set and saves 30% training time needed for a transformer model to yield\nthe same BLEU scores on a translation dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 22:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

The millimeter weighting functions peak between 1 and 10 bar on\nNeptune, lying in between the altitudes probed at visible/infrared and\ncentimeter wavelengths. Thus, these observations provide important constraints\non the atmospheric structure and dynamics of Neptune.\n  We identify seven well-resolved latitudinal bands of discrete brightness\ntemperature variations, on the order of $0.5-3$K in all three observed ALMA\nspectral bands.

To\nsearch for critical scenarios, an auxiliary objective function is designed, and\na multi-start optimization method along with seed-filling is applied. The\nproposed framework is theoretically proved to obtain accurate evaluation\nresults with much fewer number of tests, if compared with the on-road test\nmethod. In part II of the study, three case studies are investigated to\ndemonstrate the proposed methodologies. Reinforcement learning based technique\nis applied to enhance the searching method under high-dimensional scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 02:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 22:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 20:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

This is because contemporary \\reid{} models trained on one dataset do not\ngeneralise to other camera networks due to the domain-shift between datasets.\nThis requirement is often the bottleneck for deploying \\reid{} systems in\npractical security or commercial applications, as it may be impossible to\ncollect this data in advance or prohibitively costly to annotate it. This paper\nalleviates this issue by proposing a simple baseline for domain\ngeneralizable~(DG) person re-identification. That is, to learn a \\reid{} model\nfrom a set of source domains that is suitable for application to unseen\ndatasets out-of-the-box, without any model updating. Specifically, we observe\nthat the domain discrepancy in \\reid{} is due to style and content variance\nacross datasets and demonstrate appropriate Instance and Feature Normalization\nalleviates much of the resulting domain-shift in Deep \\reid{} models. Instance\nNormalization~(IN) in early layers filters out style statistic variations and\nFeature Normalization~(FN) in deep layers is able to further eliminate\ndisparity in content statistics.

The strengths of this algorithm can be\nsummarized as follows: First of all, the pure randomness in TBRF leads to the\nalmost optimal learning rates, and also makes ensemble learning possible, which\nresolves the boundary discontinuities long plaguing the existing algorithms.\nSecondly, the two-stage procedure paves the way for parallel computing, leading\nto computational efficiency. Last but not least, TBRF can serve as an inclusive\nframework where different mainstream regression strategies such as linear\npredictor and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) can also be\nincorporated as value assignment approaches on leaves of the child trees,\ndepending on the characteristics of the underlying data sets. Numerical\nassessments on comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on several\nlarge-scale real data sets validate the promising prediction accuracy and high\ncomputational efficiency of our algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 04:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

We have analysed 131 pairs of high-quality,\nfull-disc, near-co-temporal observations from SDO/HMI and Rome/PSPT spanning\nhalf a solar cycle.

Under the cover of virtual\nattacks, real attacks can achieve the real purpose of the attacker, as a\nresult, it often caused huge losses inadvertently. However, to our knowledge,\nall previous works use common methods such as Causal-Correlation or Cased-based\nto detect outdated multi-stage attacks.

In the attack scenario, the fuzzy clustering method based on\nattribute similarity is used to mine multi-stage attack chains. Then we use a\nfew-shot deep learning algorithm (SMOTE&CNN-SVM) and bidirectional Recurrent\nNeural Network model (Bi-RNN) to obtain the \"Feint Attack\" chains. \"Feint\nAttack\" is simulated by the real attack inserted in the normal causal attack\nchain, and the addition of the real attack destroys the causal relationship of\nthe original attack chain.

The system\nundergoes dynamical topological phase transition at its global periods if its\ndispersion relation is strictly linear and when all of the bosonic mode are\nproperly displaced from their equilibrium position. We corroborate the\noccurrence of dynamical phase transition by calculating Fisher zeros of the\nLoschmidt amplitude for sudden quench dynamics. A connection is established\nbetween the order of nonanalycity in the accumulated geometric phase and the\nspectral density of the system. Furthermore, it is shown that a power law\nscaling holds at all critical times for various displacement spectra, whose\ndynamical exponent equals unity. Eventually, a scheme for the quantum\nsimulation of such dynamical phase transition is proposed. The scheme is based\non the vibrational spectrum of a free-standing membrane of a two-dimensional\nmaterial. To induce a displacement in the system and for tracking its\ncollective geometrical dynamics, we propose to employ a spin that properly\ncouples to the modes. When appropriate geometrical and boundary conditions are\napplied to the membrane, a spectrum with linear dispersion is attainable, then\ndecoherence dynamics of the spin unveils occurrence of a dynamical topological\nphase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 06:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

We search for gravitational-wave transients with a duration of\nmilliseconds to approximately one second in the 32-4096 Hz frequency band with\nminimal assumptions about the signal properties, thus targeting a wide variety\nof sources. We also perform a matched-filter search for gravitational-wave\ntransients from cosmic string cusps for which the waveform is well-modeled. The\nunmodeled search detected gravitational waves from several binary black hole\nmergers which have been identified by previous analyses. No other significant\nevents have been found by either the unmodeled search or the cosmic string\nsearch.

Particularly, deep hashing methods have\ngreatly improved the search performance under supervised scenarios. In\ncontrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory\nperformance due to the lack of reliable supervisory similarity signals. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel deep unsupervised hashing model, dubbed\nDistillHash, which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data pairs,\nwhich have confidence similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the\nrelationship between the initial noisy similarity signals learned from local\nstructures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal\nclassifier. We show that under a mild assumption, some data pairs, of which\nlabels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier, can\nbe potentially distilled. Inspired by this fact, we design a simple yet\neffective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a\nBayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data\nset. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets\nshow that the proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the\nstate-of-the-art search performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 07:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

Previous works mainly discussed magnetic energy release in the closed\nfield line regions of magnetars. For a twisted magnetic field, the field lines\nwill inflate in the radial direction. Similar to normal pulsars, the idea of\nlight cylinder radius is introduced. More field lines will cross the light\ncylinder and become open for a twisted magnetic field. Therefore, magnetars may\nhave a large polar cap, which may correspond to the hot spot during outburst.\nParticle flow in the open field line regions will result in the untwisting of\nthe magnetic field. Magnetic energy release in the open field line regions can\nbe calculated. The model calculations can catch the general trend of magnetar\noutburst: decreasing X-ray luminosity, shrinking hot spot etc. For magnetic\nenergy release in the open field line regions, the geometry will be the same\nfor different outburst in one magnetar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 07:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 01:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The axion field is described by\nthe misalignment model, in which the primordial $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry is\nbroken during inflation and the $f(R)$ gravity is described by the $R^2$ model,\nand in addition, the non-minimal coupling has the form $\\sim\nh(\\phi)R^{\\gamma}$, with $0<\\gamma<0.75$. By appropriately constraining the\nnon-minimal coupling at early times, the axion field remains frozen in its\nprimordial vacuum expectation value, and the $R^2$ gravity dominates the\ninflationary era. As the Universe expands, when $H$ equals the axion mass $m_a$\nand for cosmic times for which $m_a\\gg H$, the axion field oscillates. By\nassuming a slowly varying evolution of the axion field, the axion energy\ndensity scales as $\\rho_a\\sim a^{-3}$, where $a$ is the scale factor,\nregardless of the background Hubble rate, thus behaving as cold dark matter.

The TCP Fast Open (TFO)\nprotocol can significantly decrease this delay via zero round-trip time (0-RTT)\nhandshakes for all TCP handshakes that follow a full initial handshake to the\nsame host. However, this comes at the cost of privacy limitations and also has\nsome performance limitations. In this paper, we investigate the TFP deployment\non popular websites and browsers. We found that a client revisiting a web site\nfor the first time fails to use an abbreviated TFO handshake in 40% of all\ncases due to web server load-balancing using multiple IP addresses. Our\nanalysis further reveals significant privacy problems of the protocol design\nand implementation. Network-based attackers and online trackers can exploit TFO\nto track the online activities of users. As a countermeasure, we introduce a\nnovel protocol called TCP Fast Open Privacy (FOP).

Instead, we present\nextensive evidence, collected by means of temperature- and frequency-dependent\nmeasurements of the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$, that the model of\npolaronic inter-acceptor hopping can be used to consistently explain the\nelectronic conduction process. In this framework, holes are localized to\nacceptors (Ni vacancies), forming a strongly bound, polaron-like state. They\ncan only move through the film by hopping to a neighboring, at least partially\nunoccupied, acceptor. This renders the spatial overlap between neighboring\npolaronic wave functions a highly critical parameter. The signature of this\nprocess is the occurrence of two temperature regions of the DC conductivity,\nseparated by about half the Debye temperature $\\theta_D/2 \\approx 200 K$. For\n$T > \\theta_D/2$, holes are transferred by phonon-assisted hopping over the\npotential barrier between two sites, whereas phonon-assisted tunneling through\nthe barrier dominates below that temperature. We also show that the degree of\nstructural and electronic disorder plays a vital role in determining the\ncharacteristics of the transport process: high disorder leads to strong\nenergetic broadening of the acceptor states such that hopping to more distant\nsites may be favored over transfer to nearest neighbors (variable range\nhopping). The assumption of high binding energies of the charge carriers at VNi\nis in accordance with the recent paradigm shift regarding the understanding of\nthe electronic structure of NiO: holes doped into NiO couple to Ni 3d spins,\nthereby occupying deep polaron-like states within the band gap (Zhang-Rice\nbound doublets).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 11:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Deep learning\ntechniques may help to address this issue, but the challenging problem is that\nwe need to build a large-scale image retargeting dataset for the training of\ndeep retargeting models. However, building such a dataset requires huge human\nefforts.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel deep cyclic image retargeting approach,\ncalled Cycle-IR, to firstly implement image retargeting with a single deep\nmodel, without relying on any explicit user annotations. Our idea is built on\nthe reverse mapping from the retargeted images to the given input images. If\nthe retargeted image has serious distortion or excessive loss of important\nvisual information, the reverse mapping is unlikely to restore the input image\nwell. We constrain this forward-reverse consistency by introducing a cyclic\nperception coherence loss. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective image\nretargeting network (IRNet) to implement the image retargeting process. Our\nIRNet contains a spatial and channel attention layer, which is able to\ndiscriminate visually important regions of input images effectively, especially\nin cluttered images. Given arbitrary sizes of input images and desired aspect\nratios, our Cycle-IR can produce visually pleasing target images directly.\nExtensive experiments on the standard RetargetMe dataset show the superiority\nof our Cycle-IR.

The\napproach was assessed in phantom experiments and compared to Cartesian\nreference measurements, namely inversion recovery (IR), multi-echo spin echo\n(MESE) and Cartesian MRF, by normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and\nstandard deviation (STD) calculations.

We also show how the CPD parameters, e.g. the dust-to-gas\nratio will affect the resulting CPD magnitudes. According to the SEDs, the best\ncontrast ratio between the CPD and circumstellar disks is in sub-mm/radio\nwavelengths and between 8-33 microns in case if the planet opened a resolvable,\ndeep gap ($\\ge 5 \\rm{M_{Jup}}$), while the contrast is particularly poor in the\nnear-IR. Hence, to detect the forming planet and its CPD, the best chance today\nis targeting the sub-mm/radio wavelengths and the 10-micron silicate feature\nvicinity. In order to estimate the forming planet's mass from the observed\nbrightness, it is necessary to run system specific disk modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 12:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

To timely detect and contain such\nattacks, collaboration among the defenders is critical. By correlating\nreal-time detection information (alerts) from multiple sources (collaborative\nintrusion detection), defenders can detect attacks and take the appropriate\ndefensive measures in time. However, although the technical tools to facilitate\ncollaboration exist, real-world adoption of such collaborative security\nmechanisms is still underwhelming.

TRIDEnT allows parties that may be in a competitive relationship,\nto selectively advertise, sell and acquire security alerts in the form of\n(near) real-time peer-to-peer streams. To validate the basic principles behind\nTRIDEnT, we present an intuitive game-theoretic model of alert sharing, that is\nof independent interest, and show that collaboration is bound to take place\ninfinitely often.

We quantify the magnitude of the\nresulting excursion away from the unperturbed synchronous state through\nquadratic performance measures in the angle or frequency deviations. We find\nthat the most fragile oscillators in a given network are identified by\ncentralities constructed from network resistance distances. Further defining\nthe global robustness of the system from the average response over ensembles of\nhomogeneously distributed perturbations, we find that it is given by a family\nof topological indices known as generalized Kirchhoff indices.

First, we aim to extend for $0<s<1$ the\nresults of one of the authors about equilibrium measures in the real axis in\nexternal fields created by point-mass charges for the case of logarithmic\npotentials ($s=0$).\n  Our second motivation comes from the work of the other two authors on Riesz\n$s$-equilibrium problems on finitely many intervals on the real line in the\npresence of external fields. They have shown that when the signed equilibrium\nmeasure has concave positive part on every interval, then the $s$-equilibrium\nsupport is also a union of finitely many intervals, with one of them at most\nincluded in each of the initial intervals. As the positive part of the signed\nequilibrium for point-mass external fields is not necessarily concave, the\ninvestigation of the corresponding $s$-equilibrium support is of comparative\ninterest.

Unfortunately, however, such\nschemes are not conservative. There are two main sources of lack of\nconservation. First, when using classical continuous Maxwellian, conservation\nerror is negligible only if velocity space is resolved with sufficiently large\nnumber of grid points. However, for a small number of grids in velocity space\nsuch error is not negligible, because the parameters of the Maxwellian do not\ncoincide with the discrete moments. Secondly, the non-linear reconstruction\nused to prevent oscillations destroys the translation invariance which is at\nthe basis of the conservation properties of the scheme. As a consequence the\nschemes show a wrong shock speed in the limit of small Knudsen number. To treat\nthe first problem and ensure machine precision conservation of mass, momentum\nand energy with a relatively small number of velocity grid points, we replace\nthe continuous Maxwellian with the discrete Maxwellian introduced by Mieussens.\nThe second problem is treated by implementing a conservative correction\nprocedure based on the flux difference form. In this way we can construct a\nconservative semi-Lagrangian scheme which is Asymptotic Preserving (AP) for the\nunderlying Euler limit, as the Knudsen number vanishes. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed scheme is demonstrated by extensive numerical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 14:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

Additionally, researchers\nare recently getting more interest in variable importance due to the increasing\nnumber of variables that become available for clustering.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian finite mixture model to\nsimultaneously conduct variable selection, account for biomarker LOD and obtain\nclustering results. We took a Bayesian approach to obtain parameter estimates\nand the cluster membership to bypass the limitation of the EM algorithm. To\naccount for LOD, we added one more step in Gibbs sampling to iteratively fill\nin biomarker values below or above LODs.

Models have often struggled to reproduce the small number of\npost-CE WDMS binaries with anomalously long orbital periods greater than\n$\\sim$4 d, though recent studies suggest that in longer period systems\nrecombination energy may help contribute to the efficient ejection of the CE.\nPlanetary nebulae (PNe) are an emerging source of rare long period post-CE\nbinaries which can act as powerful complementary constraints on population\nsynthesis models to more traditional post-CE binary populations. A tentative\n9.0 d orbital period was recently proposed for the central star of the PN\nIC~4776, potentially one of the longest periods observed in post-CE WDMS\nbinaries. Here we present SALT HRS observations of IC~4776 that rule out a 9.0\nd orbital period, as well as the previously suggested Wolf-Rayet classification\nof the primary. The SALT HRS data establish a 3.11 d orbital period and rule\nout Of and Wolf-Rayet primary spectral types. Assuming a mass of 0.6 $M_\\odot$\nfor the primary and an orbital inclination matching the nebula orientation, we\nfind a companion mass of $0.22\\pm0.03$ $M_\\odot$, most likely corresponding to\nan M4V companion. The orbital period of IC~4776 is still consistent with\nfindings of abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) studies of post-CE PNe, but any\ntrends in the ADF distribution derived from the sample remain significantly\nbiased by selection effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 15:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Finally,\nextensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that\nSWMEB and SWMEB+ achieve speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the\nstate-of-the-art batch algorithm while providing coresets for MEB with rather\nsmall errors compared to the optimal ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 15:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 05:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

The experimental results indicate that the\nproposed method exhibits not only a better near-lossless compression\nperformance than that of the two-layer coding method of the JPEG XT, but also\nthere are no issue regarding the combination of parameter values without losing\nbackward compatibility to the JPEG standard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 09:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Dynamic modulus is a function\nof material properties, loading, and environmental conditions. Developing\npredictive models for dynamic modulus is efficient and cost effective.
