Computations using sparse\nmatrices obtained by pruning parameters, however, exhibit vastly different\nparallelism depending on the index representation scheme. As a result,\nfine-grained pruning has not gained much attention due to its irregular index\nform leading to large memory footprint and low parallelism for convolutions and\nmatrix multiplications. In this paper, we propose a new network pruning\ntechnique that generates a low-rank binary index matrix to compress index data\nwhile decompressing index data is performed by simple binary matrix\nmultiplication. This proposed compression method finds a particular\nfine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices. We\nalso propose a tile-based factorization technique that not only lowers memory\nrequirements but also enhances compression ratio. Various DNN models can be\npruned with much fewer indexes compared to previous sparse matrix formats while\nmaintaining the same pruning rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Among the seismic parameters associated with mixed modes, the gravity\noffset, denoted with $\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}$, is expected to reveal information\non the boundaries of the inner buoyancy resonant cavity. This parameter was\nrecently measured for hundreds of stars observed by the Kepler satellite and\nits value was shown to change during the evolution on the red giant branch. In\nthis article, we theoretically investigate the reasons for such a variation in\nterms of structure properties. Using available asymptotic analyses and a simple\nmodel of the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a and Lamb frequencies, we derived an analytical\nexpression of $\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}$ for dipolar modes and compared its\npredictions to observations. First, we show that the asymptotic value of\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}$ well agrees with the mean value observed at the beginning\nof the ascent of the red giant branch, which results from the high density\ncontrast between the helium core and the base of the convective envelope.\nSecond, we demonstrate that the predicted value also explains the sharp\ndecrease in $\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}$ observed for the more luminous red giant\nstars of the sample. This rapid drop turns out to occur just before the\nluminosity bump and result from the kink of the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency\nnear the upper turning point associated with the buoyancy cavity as stars\nevolve and this latter becomes close to the base of the convective envelope.The\nobserved variation in $\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}$ and its link with the internal\nproperties on the red giant branch are now globally understood. This motivates\nfurther analyses of the potential of this parameter as a seismic diagnosis of\nthe region located between the helium core and the convective envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 16:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Research in Automated Planning aims at\ndeveloping general reasoners (i.e., planners) capable of automatically solve\ncomplex problems. Broadly speaking, planners rely on a general model\ncharacterizing the possible states of the world and the actions that can be\nperformed in order to change the status of the world. Given a model and an\ninitial known state, the objective of a planner is to synthesize a set of\nactions needed to achieve a particular goal state. The classical approach to\nplanning roughly corresponds to the description given above. The timeline-based\napproach is a particular planning paradigm capable of integrating causal and\ntemporal reasoning within a unified solving process. This approach has been\nsuccessfully applied in many real-world scenarios although a common\ninterpretation of the related planning concepts is missing. Indeed, there are\nsignificant differences among the existing frameworks that apply this\ntechnique. Each framework relies on its own interpretation of timeline-based\nplanning and therefore it is not easy to compare these systems. Thus, the\nobjective of this work is to investigate the timeline-based approach to\nplanning by addressing several aspects ranging from the semantics of the\nrelated planning concepts to the modeling and solving techniques. Specifically,\nthe main contributions of this PhD work consist of: (i) the proposal of a\nformal characterization of the timeline-based approach capable of dealing with\ntemporal uncertainty; (ii) the proposal of a hierarchical modeling and solving\napproach; (iii) the development of a general purpose framework for planning and\nexecution with timelines; (iv) the validation{\\dag}of this approach in\nreal-world manufacturing scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 16:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

The\nshock-induced initiation behaviors resulting from the cases with neat NM, NM\nwith an array of regularly spaced cavities, and NM with randomly distributed\ncavities are examined. For the case with randomly distributed cavities,\nhundreds of cavities are explicitly resolved in the simulations using a\ndiffuse-interface approach to treat two immiscible fluids and GPU-enabled\nparallel computing. Without invoking any empirically calibrated,\nphenomenological models, the reaction rate in the simulations is governed by\nArrhenius kinetics. For the cases with neat NM, the resulting SDT process\nfeatures a superdetonation that evolves from a thermal explosion after a delay\nfollowing the passage of the incident shock wave and eventually catches up with\nthe leading shock front. For the cases wherein mesoscale heterogeneities are\nexplicitly considered, a gradual SDT process is captured. These two distinct\ninitiation behaviors for neat NM and heterogeneous NM mixtures agree with\nexperimental findings. Via examining the global reaction rate of the mixture, a\nunique time scale characterizing the SDT process, i.e., the overtake time, is\nmeasured for each simulation. For an input shock pressure less than\napproximately $9.4~\\mathrm{GPa}$, the overtake time resulting from a\nheterogeneous mixture is shorter than that for neat NM.

To explain its unusually rounded and relatively weak emission\nline profiles, it has been proposed that WR2 is rotating close to break-up with\na magnetically confined wind. Alternatively, the line profiles could be\nexplained by the dilution of WR2's spectrum by that of a companion. In this\npaper, we present a study of WR2 using near-infrared AO imaging and optical\nspectroscopy and polarimetry. Our spectra reveal the presence of weak\nphotospheric absorption lines from a ~B2.5-4V companion, which however\ncontributes only ~5-10% to the total light, suggesting that the companion is a\nbackground object. Therefore, its flux cannot be causing any significant\ndilution of the WR star's emission lines. The absence of intrinsic linear\ncontinuum polarization from WR2 does not support the proposed fast rotation.\nOur Stokes V spectrum was not of sufficient quality to test the presence of a\nmoderately strong organized magnetic field but our new modelling indicates that\nto confine the wind the putative magnetic field must be significantly stronger\nthan was previously suggested sufficiently strong as to make its presence\nimplausible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 19:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

In practice, accurate and tractable models of the\ncomplete object statistics are often difficult to determine. Moreover, in\nimaging systems that employ compressive sensing concepts, imaging hardware and\nsparse image reconstruction are innately coupled technologies. In this work, a\nsparsity-driven observer (SDO) that can be employed to optimize hardware by use\nof a stochastic object model describing object sparsity is described and\ninvestigated.

Although the\ninviscid problem can, like the planar case, be mapped exactly onto the Mathieu\nequation, the spherical geometry introduces additional terms into the analysis.\nThe dependence of the threshold on viscosity is studied and scaling laws are\nfound. It is shown that the spherical thresholds are similar to the planar\ninfinite-depth thresholds, even for small wavenumbers for which the curvature\nis high.

ABC defines\na pseudo-posterior by comparing observed data with simulated data,\ntraditionally based on some summary statistics, the elicitation of which is\nregarded as a key difficulty. Recently, using data discrepancy measures has\nbeen proposed in order to bypass the construction of summary statistics. Here\nwe propose to use the importance-sampling ABC (IS-ABC) algorithm relying on the\nso-called two-sample energy statistic. We establish a new asymptotic result for\nthe case where both the observed sample size and the simulated data sample size\nincrease to infinity, which highlights to what extent the data discrepancy\nmeasure impacts the asymptotic pseudo-posterior. The result holds in the broad\nsetting of IS-ABC methodologies, thus generalizing previous results that have\nbeen established only for rejection ABC algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a\nconsistent V-statistic estimator of the energy statistic, under which we show\nthat the large sample result holds, and prove that the rejection ABC algorithm,\nbased on the energy statistic, generates pseudo-posterior distributions that\nachieves convergence to the correct limits, when implemented with rejection\nthresholds that converge to zero, in the finite sample setting.

The diagonal matrix can learn a rescaling of the\nproblem in the coordinates within linear number of function evaluations.\nDiagonal decoding can also exploit separability of the problem, but, crucially,\ndoes not compromise the performance on non-separable problems. The latter is\naccomplished by modulating the learning rate for the diagonal matrix based on\nthe condition number of the underlying correlation matrix. dd-CMA-ES not only\ncombines the advantages of default and separable CMA-ES, but may achieve\noveradditive speedup: it improves the performance, and even the scaling, of the\nbetter of default and separable CMA-ES on classes of non-separable test\nfunctions that reflect, arguably, a landscape feature commonly observed in\npractice.\n  The paper makes two further secondary contributions: we introduce two\ndifferent approaches to guarantee positive definiteness of the covariance\nmatrix with active CMA, which is valuable in particular with large population\nsize; we revise the default parameter setting in CMA-ES, proposing accelerated\nsettings in particular for large dimension.\n  All our contributions can be viewed as independent improvements of CMA-ES,\nyet they are also complementary and can be seamlessly combined.

To alleviate this striking difference in efficiency, we propose a\ntask-driven modular architecture for compositional reasoning and sample\nefficient learning. Our architecture consists of a set of neural network\nmodules, which are small fully connected layers operating in semantic concept\nspace. These modules are configured through a gating function conditioned on\nthe task to produce features representing the compatibility between the input\nimage and the concept under consideration. This enables us to express tasks as\na combination of sub-tasks and to generalize to unseen categories by\nreweighting a set of small modules. Furthermore, the network can be trained\nefficiently as it is fully differentiable and its modules operate on small\nsub-spaces. We focus our study on the problem of compositional zero-shot\nclassification of object-attribute categories. We show in our experiments that\ncurrent evaluation metrics are flawed as they only consider unseen\nobject-attribute pairs. When extending the evaluation to the generalized\nsetting which accounts also for pairs seen during training, we discover that\nnaive baseline methods perform similarly or better than current approaches.\nHowever, our modular network is able to outperform all existing approaches on\ntwo widely-used benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 01:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

There are\nindications that while equity ratios have been increased massively since the\nfinancial crisis, systemic risk levels might not have lowered, but even\nincreased. It has been shown that systemic risk is to a large extent related to\nthe underlying network topology of financial exposures. A natural question\narising is how much systemic risk can be eliminated by optimally rearranging\nthese networks and without increasing capital requirements. Overlapping\nportfolios with minimized systemic risk which provide the same market\nfunctionality as empirical ones have been studied by [pichler2018]. Here we\npropose a similar method for direct exposure networks, and apply it to\ncross-sectional interbank loan networks, consisting of 10 quarterly\nobservations of the Austrian interbank market.

The presented optimization\nprocedure is not intended to actually re-configure interbank markets, but to\ndemonstrate the huge potential for systemic risk management through rearranging\nexposure networks, in contrast to increasing capital requirements that were\nshown to have only marginal effects on systemic risk [poledna2017].

These steps involve phase unwrapping, brain\nvolume extraction, background phase removal and solving an ill-posed inverse\nproblem. The resulting susceptibility map is known to suffer from inaccuracy\nnear the edges of the brain tissues, in part due to imperfect brain extraction,\nedge erosion of the brain tissue and the lack of phase measurement outside the\nbrain. This inaccuracy has thus hindered the application of QSM for measuring\nthe susceptibility of tissues near the brain edges, e.g., quantifying cortical\nlayers and generating superficial venography. To address these challenges, we\npropose a learning-based QSM reconstruction method that directly estimates the\nmagnetic susceptibility from total phase images without the need for brain\nextraction and background phase removal, referred to as autoQSM. The neural\nnetwork has a modified U-net structure and is trained using QSM maps computed\nby a two-step QSM method. 209 healthy subjects with ages ranging from 11 to 82\nyears were employed for patch-wise network training. The network was validated\non data dissimilar to the training data, e.g. in vivo mouse brain data and\nbrains with lesions, which suggests that the network has generalized and\nlearned the underlying mathematical relationship between magnetic field\nperturbation and magnetic susceptibility. AutoQSM was able to recover magnetic\nsusceptibility of anatomical structures near the edges of the brain including\nthe veins covering the cortical surface, spinal cord and nerve tracts near the\nmouse brain boundaries. The advantages of high-quality maps, no need for brain\nvolume extraction and high reconstruction speed demonstrate its potential for\nfuture applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 05:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

For\nonline recommendation, this implies that users' preferences and ratings are\ninfluenced due to other individuals. Given only time-stamped reviews of users,\ncan we find out who-influences-whom, and characteristics of the underlying\ninfluence network? Can we use this network to improve recommendation?\n  While prior works in social-aware recommendation have leveraged social\ninteraction by considering the observed social network of users, many\ncommunities like Amazon, Beeradvocate, and Ratebeer do not have explicit\nuser-user links. Therefore, we propose GhostLink, an unsupervised probabilistic\ngraphical model, to automatically learn the latent influence network underlying\na review community -- given only the temporal traces (timestamps) of users'\nposts and their content.

Communication is a major bottleneck\nin such applications, and in recent years, compressed stochastic gradient\nmethods such as QSGD (quantized SGD) and sparse SGD have been proposed to\nreduce communication. It was also shown that error compensation can be combined\nwith compression to achieve better convergence in a scheme that each node\ncompresses its local stochastic gradient and broadcast the result to all other\nnodes over the network in a single pass. However, such a single pass broadcast\napproach is not realistic in many practical implementations. For example, under\nthe popular parameter server model for distributed learning, the worker nodes\nneed to send the compressed local gradients to the parameter server, which\nperforms the aggregation. The parameter server has to compress the aggregated\nstochastic gradient again before sending it back to the worker nodes.

Although an effective method\nfor testing security, pentesting requires highly skilled practitioners and\ncurrently there is a growing shortage of skilled cyber security professionals.\nOne avenue for alleviating this problem is automate the pentesting process\nusing artificial intelligence techniques. Current approaches to automated\npentesting have relied on model-based planning, however the cyber security\nlandscape is rapidly changing making maintaining up-to-date models of exploits\na challenge. This project investigated the application of model-free\nReinforcement Learning (RL) to automated pentesting. Model-free RL has the key\nadvantage over model-based planning of not requiring a model of the\nenvironment, instead learning the best policy through interaction with the\nenvironment. We first designed and built a fast, low compute simulator for\ntraining and testing autonomous pentesting agents. We did this by framing\npentesting as a Markov Decision Process with the known configuration of the\nnetwork as states, the available scans and exploits as actions, the reward\ndetermined by the value of machines on the network. We then used this simulator\nto investigate the application of model-free RL to pentesting. We tested the\nstandard Q-learning algorithm using both tabular and neural network based\nimplementations. We found that within the simulated environment both tabular\nand neural network implementations were able to find optimal attack paths for a\nrange of different network topologies and sizes without having a model of\naction behaviour. However, the implemented algorithms were only practical for\nsmaller networks and numbers of actions. Further work is needed in developing\nscalable RL algorithms and testing these algorithms in larger and higher\nfidelity environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 06:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

As a result,\nmultiple protections for safeguarding the integrity of kernel code and data are\nbeing continuously proposed and deployed. These existing protections, however,\nare far from ideal as they either provide partial protection, or require\ncomplex and high overhead hardware and software stacks.\n  In this work, we present Neverland: a low-overhead, hardware-assisted, memory\nprotection scheme that safeguards the operating system from rootkits and\nkernel-mode malware. Once the system is done booting, Neverland's hardware\ntakes away the operating system's ability to overwrite certain configuration\nregisters, as well as portions of its own physical address space that contain\nkernel code and security-critical data. Furthermore, it prohibits the CPU from\nfetching privileged code from any memory region lying outside the physical\naddresses assigned to the OS kernel and drivers (regardless of virtual page\npermissions). This combination of protections makes it extremely hard for an\nattacker to tamper with the kernel or introduce new privileged code into the\nsystem -- even in the presence of kernel vulnerabilities. Our evaluations show\nthat the extra hardware required to support these protections incurs minimal\nsilicon and energy overheads. Neverland enables operating systems to reduce\ntheir attack surface without having to rely on complex integrity monitoring\nsoftware or hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 06:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

The minimum growth time of the unstable slow magnetosonic waves in\ndiffuse clouds is of $4-60$ Myr, minimum and the most unstable wavelengths lie\nin ranges $0.05-0.5$ and $0.5-5$ pc, respectively. We discuss the application\nof considered instability to the formation of small-scale structures and the\ngeneration of MHD turbulence in the cold neutral medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 07:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The existing congestion control is hard\nto simultaneously achieve low latency, high throughput, good adaptability and\nfair bandwidth allocation, mainly because of the hardwired control strategy and\negocentric convergence objective. To address these issues, we propose an\nend-to-end statistical learning based congestion control, named Iris. By\nexploring the underlying principles of self-inflicted delay, we reveal that\ncongestion delay is determined by sending rate, receiving rate and network\nstatus, which inspires us to control video bit rate using a\nstatistical-learning congestion control model. The key idea of Iris is to force\nall flows to converge to the same queue load, and adjust the bit rate by the\nmodel. All flows keep a small and fixed number of packets queuing in the\nnetwork, thus the fair bandwidth allocation and low latency are both achieved.\nBesides, the adjustment step size of sending rate is updated by online\nlearning, to better adapt to dynamically changing networks. We carried out\nextensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Iris, with the\nimplementations of transport layer (UDP) and application layer (QUIC)\nrespectively. The testing environment includes emulated network, real-world\nInternet and commercial LTE networks. Compared against TCP flavors and\nstate-of-the-art protocols, Iris is able to achieve high bandwidth utilization,\nlow latency and good fairness concurrently. Especially over QUIC, Iris is able\nto increase the video bitrate up to 25%, and PSNR up to 1dB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 07:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 01:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

The algorithm, named Automatic Model\nSelection, is a modified micro-genetic algorithm that automatically and\nefficiently finds the most suitable neural network model for a given dataset.\nThe main contributions of this method are a simple list based encoding for\nneural networks as genotypes in an evolutionary algorithm, new crossover, and\nmutation operators, the introduction of a fitness function that considers both,\nthe accuracy of the model and its complexity and a method to measure the\nsimilarity between two neural networks. AMS is evaluated on two different\ndatasets.

Here, the properties of this scale separation are analysed\nusing high-resolution numerical simulations that approach closer to Earth's\ncore conditions than earlier models. The new simulations are obtained by\nincreasing the resolution and gradually relaxing the hyperdiffusive\napproximation of previously published low-resolution cases. This upsizing\nprocess does not perturb the previously obtained large-scale, leading-order\nquasi-geostrophic (QG), and first-order magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) force\nbalances. As Earth's core conditions are approached in the upsized simulations,\nkinetic energy spectra feature a gradually broadening self-similar, power-law\nspectral range extending over more than a decade in length scale. In this\nrange, the spectral energy density profile of vorticity is shown to be\napproximately flat between the large scale at which the magnetic field draws\nits energy from convection through the QG-MAC force balance and the small scale\nat which this energy is dissipated. The resulting velocity and density anomaly\nplanforms in the physical space consist in large-scale columnar sheets and\nplumes, respectively co-existing with small-scale vorticity filaments and\ndensity anomaly ramifications. In contrast, magnetic field planforms keep their\nlarge-scale structure after upsizing. The diagnostic outputs of the upsized\nsimulations are more consistent with the asymptotic QG-MAC theory than those of\nthe low-resolution cases that they originate from, but still feature small\nresidual deviations that may call for further theoretical refinements to\naccount for the structuring constraints of the magnetic field on the flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 09:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

We review\nhere the binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) subclass whose progenitor is a\nCO$_\\textrm{core}$-neutron star (NS). The supernova (SN) explosion of the\nCO$_\\textrm{core}$ produces at its center a new NS ($\\nu$NS) and triggers a\nhypercritical accretion onto the NS. The NS can become a more massive NS or\ncollapse into a black hole (BH). We summarize this topic from the first\nanalytic estimates in 2012 to the most recent three-dimensional (3D)\nsmoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations in 2018. Long GRBs\nare richer and more complex than previously thought. The SN and the accretion\nexplain X-ray precursors. The NS accretion, its collapse and the BH formation\nproduce asymmetries in the SN ejecta, implying a 3D GRB analysis. The newborn\nBH surrounded by the ejecta and the magnetic field inherited from the NS, are\nthe \\emph{inner engine} from which the electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) plasma and\nthe high-energy emission initiate. The $e^+e^-$ impact on the ejecta converts\nthe SN into a hypernova (HN). The plasma dynamics in the ejecta explains the\nultrarelativistic prompt emission in the MeV domain and the mildly-relativistic\nflares of the early afterglow in the X-ray domain. The feedback of the $\\nu$NS\nemission on the HN explains the X-ray late afterglow and its power-law regime.\nAll the above is in contrast with GRB models attempting to explain all the GRB\nphases with the kinetic energy of anultrarelativistic jet, as traditionally\nproposed in the \"collapsar-fireball\" model. In addition, BdHNe in their\ndifferent flavors lead to $\\nu$NS-NS or $\\nu$NS-BH binaries. These binaries\nmerge by gravitational wave emission producing short GRBs, establishing a\nconnection between long and short GRBs and their occurrence rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 09:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

Earlier work suggests that slowly rotating asteroids should have\nhigher thermal inertias than faster rotators because the heat wave penetrates\ndeeper into the sub-surface. However, thermal inertias have been determined\nmainly for fast rotators due to selection effects in the available photometry\nused to obtain shape models required for thermophysical modelling (TPM).\n  Aims. Our aims are to mitigate these selection effects by producing shape\nmodels of slow rotators, to scale them and compute their thermal inertia with\nTPM, and to verify whether thermal inertia increases with the rotation period.\n  Methods. To decrease the bias against slow rotators, we conducted a\nphotometric observing campaign of main-belt asteroids with periods longer than\n12 hours, from multiple stations worldwide, adding in some cases data from WISE\nand Kepler space telescopes. For spin and shape reconstruction we used the\nlightcurve inversion method, and to derive thermal inertias we applied a\nthermophysical model to fit available infrared data from IRAS, AKARI, and WISE.\n  Results. We present new models of 11 slow rotators that provide a good fit to\nthe thermal data. In two cases, the TPM analysis showed a clear preference for\none of the two possible mirror solutions. We derived the diameters and albedos\nof our targets in addition to their thermal inertias, which ranged between\n3$^{+33}_{-3}$ and 45$^{+60}_{-30}$ Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-1/2}$K$^{-1}$.\n  Conclusions. Together with our previous work, we have analysed 16 slow\nrotators from our dense survey with sizes between 30 and 150 km. The current\nsample thermal inertias vary widely, which does not confirm the earlier\nsuggestion that slower rotators have higher thermal inertias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 09:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

An interface charge transfer (ICT) from dns-Si specific\nto the anion type of the dielectric is at the core of this effect and arguably\nnested in quantum-chemical properties of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) vs. Si. We\ninvestigate the size up to which this energy offset defines the electronic\nstructure of dns-Si by density functional theory (DFT), considering interface\norientation, embedding layer thickness, and approximants featuring two Si\nnanocrystals (NCs); one embedded in SiO$_2$ and the other in Si$_3$N$_4$.\nWorking with synchrotron ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), we use\nSiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedded Si nanowells (NWells) to obtain their energy\nof the top valence band states.

Starting off in the early 2000's,\nwith limited to no tool support, nowadays, several software tools, i.e., both\nopen-source, e.g., ProM and Apromore, and commercial, e.g., Disco, Celonis,\nProcessGold, etc., exist. The commercial process mining tools provide limited\nsupport for implementing custom algorithms. Moreover, both commercial and\nopen-source process mining tools are often only accessible through a graphical\nuser interface, which hampers their usage in large-scale experimental settings.\nInitiatives such as RapidProM provide process mining support in the scientific\nworkflow-based data science suite RapidMiner. However, these offer limited to\nno support for algorithmic customization. In the light of the aforementioned,\nin this paper, we present a novel process mining library, i.e. Process Mining\nfor Python (PM4Py) that aims to bridge this gap, providing integration with\nstate-of-the-art data science libraries, e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy and\nscikit-learn.

This is shown to be\nalways possible, by a lemma depending primarily on Carath\\'eodory's theorem.\nThe resulting one-dimensional rules can be used within a Smolyak procedure to\nproduce sparse multi-dimensional rules, but weight positivity is lost then. As\na remedy, the reduction procedure is directly applied to multi-dimensional\ntensor-product cubature rules. This allows to produce a family of sparse\ncubature rules with positive weights, competitive with Smolyak rules. Finally\nthe positivity constraint is relaxed to allow more flexibility in the removal\nof nodes. This gives a second family of sparse cubature rules, in which\niteratively as many nodes as possible are removed.

In this paper, we consider information and thermodynamic exchanges\nbetween a pair of coupled systems that do not satisfy the bipartite property.\nThe generalization of information-theoretic measures, such as learning rates\nand transfer entropy rates, to this situation is non-trivial and also involves\nintroducing several additional rates. We describe how this can be achieved in\nthe framework of general continuous-time Markov processes, without restricting\nthe study to the steady-state regime. We illustrate our general formalism on\nthe case of diffusion processes and derive an extension of the second law of\ninformation thermodynamics in which the difference of transfer entropy rates in\nthe forward and backward time directions replaces the learning rate.

The effect of a finite diffusion length is to increase the\nfinal relic freeze-out abundance over its corresponding value when diffusion\neffects are ignored. When diffusion is limited only by scattering off of the\nthermal background, and the annihilation cross section is bounded by unitarity,\na significant effect on the freeze-out abundance requires a scattering cross\nsection much larger than the annihilation cross section. A similar effect is\ndemonstrated when the relic particles are produced via the freeze-in mechanism,\nbut in this case the finite diffusion length is due to the scattering of\nparticles that annihilate into the relic particle of interest. For freeze in,\nthe effect of a finite diffusion length is to reduce the final relic particle\nabundance.

Then, topological\ncrystalline insulator, which can not be considered as a descendent of Quantum\nSpin Hall or Integer Quantum Hall insulator, has been introduced. Finally, we\ndiscussed the presence of magnetism in some topological materials and its\nconsequence on electronic band structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 15:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

For binary signal\ndetection tasks, the Bayesian Ideal Observer (IO) sets an upper limit of\nobserver performance and has been advocated for use in optimizing medical\nimaging systems and data-acquisition designs.

However, most of the previous methods only considered the taxi demand\nprediction in origin regions, but neglected the modeling of the specific\nsituation of the destination passengers. We believe it is suboptimal to\npreallocate the taxi into each region based solely on the taxi origin demand.\nIn this paper, we present a challenging and worth-exploring task, called taxi\norigin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting the taxi demand\nbetween all region pairs in a future time interval. Its main challenges come\nfrom how to effectively capture the diverse contextual information to learn the\ndemand patterns. We address this problem with a novel Contextualized\nSpatial-Temporal Network (CSTN), which consists of three components for the\nmodeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context (TEC) and\nglobal correlation context (GCC) respectively. Firstly, an LSC module utilizes\ntwo convolution neural networks to learn the local spatial dependencies of taxi\ndemand respectively from the origin view and the destination view. Secondly, a\nTEC module incorporates both the local spatial features of taxi demand and the\nmeteorological information to a Convolutional Long Short-term Memory Network\n(ConvLSTM) for the analysis of taxi demand evolution. Finally, a GCC module is\napplied to model the correlation between all regions by computing a global\ncorrelation feature as a weighted sum of all regional features, with the\nweights being calculated as the similarity between the corresponding region\npairs. Extensive experiments and evaluations on a large-scale dataset well\ndemonstrate the superiority of our CSTN over other compared methods for taxi\norigin-destination demand prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 10:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

In this paper, we take the\nstructural characteristics of heterogeneous relations into consideration and\npropose a novel Relation structure-aware Heterogeneous Information Network\nEmbedding model (RHINE).

ROIreg focuses on the maximum probability of a\nposterior probability distribution g(x) obtained when inputting an unlabeled\ndata sample x into a convolutional neural network (CNN). ROIreg divides the\npixel set of x into multiple blocks and evaluates, for each block, its\ncontribution to the maximum probability. A masked data sample x_ROI is\ngenerated by replacing blocks with relatively small degrees of contribution\nwith random images. Then, ROIreg trains CNN so that g(x_ROI ) does not change\nas much as possible from g(x). Therefore, ROIreg can be said to refine the\nclassification ability of CNN more. On the other hand, Virtual Adverserial\nTraining (VAT), which is an excellent semi-supervised learning method,\ngenerates data sample x_VAT by perturbing x in the direction in which g(x)\nchanges most. Then, VAT trains CNN so that g(x_VAT ) does not change from g(x)\nas much as possible. Therefore, VAT can be said to be a method to improve CNN's\nweakness. Thus, ROIreg and VAT have complementary training effects. In fact,\nthe combination of VAT and ROIreg improves the results obtained when using VAT\nor ROIreg alone. This combination also improves the state-of-the-art on \"SVHN\nwith and without data augmentation\" and \"CIFAR-10 without data augmentation\".\nWe also propose a method called ROI augmentation (ROIaug) as a method to apply\nROIreg to data augmentation in supervised learning.

The main idea of this work is\nto operate on a multidisciplinary level to identify propeller shapes that lead\nto reduced tip vortex-induced pressure and increased efficiency without\naltering the thrust. First, a specific tool for the bottom-up construction of\nparameterized propeller blade geometries has been developed. The algorithm\nproposed operates with a user defined number of arbitrary shaped or NACA\nairfoil sections, and employs arbitrary degree NURBS to represent the chord,\npitch, skew and rake distribution as a function of the blade radial coordinate.\nThe control points of such curves have been modified to generate, in a fully\nautomated way, a family of blade geometries depending on as many as 20 shape\nparameters. Such geometries have then been used to carry out potential flow\nsimulations with the Boundary Element Method based software PROCAL. Given the\nhigh number of parameters considered, such a preliminary stage allowed for a\nfast evaluation of the performance of several hundreds of shapes. In addition,\nthe data obtained from the potential flow simulation allowed for the\napplication of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active\nsubspaces (AS) property, which suggested that the main propeller performance\nindices are, at a first but rather accurate approximation, only depending on a\nsingle parameter which is a linear combination of all the original geometric\nones. AS analysis has also been used to carry out a constrained optimization\nexploiting response surface method in the reduced parameter space, and a\nsensitivity analysis based on such surrogate model.

We suggest that the\nformation of the E8 lattice in 8-dimensions, from which three-dimensional\nicosahedral quasicrystals derive by projection, occurs without dimensionally\nrestricting the degrees of freedom of the quaternion orientational order\nparameter to the quaternion plane. This is different from the development of\nregular crystalline solids in three-dimensions, which occurs in \"restricted\ndimensions\" and requires topological-ordering, as previously discussed by the\nauthors. In other words, herein, the formation of lattices in eight-dimensions\nis considered as a higher-dimensional analogy to the formation of \"bulk\"\nsuperfluidity. It follows that, the solidification of lattices in 8-dimensions\n(and derivative icosahedral quasicrystalline solids) should occur without the\nnecessity of topological defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 18:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

Our proposed opportunistic\nalgorithm utilizes an ensemble of online hiring algorithms, which are run\ntogether in passive mode, to select the online hiring algorithm that has\nperformed the best in recent history. The proposed ensemble based algorithm is\nevaluated empirically using real-world traces from taxies plying routes in\nShanghai, China, and its performance is compared against a baseline of four\nstate-of-the-art online hiring algorithms.

In their one-way\nrestriction, the latter transducers define the class of rational functions.\nEven though regular functions are robustly characterised by several\nfinite-state devices, even the subclass of rational functions may contain\nfunctions which are not computable (by a Turing machine with infinite input).\nThis paper proposes a decision procedure for the following synthesis problem:\ngiven a regular function $f$ (equivalently specified by one of the\naforementioned transducer model), is $f$ computable and if it is, synthesize a\nTuring machine computing it.\n  For regular functions, we show that computability is equivalent to\ncontinuity, and therefore the problem boils down to deciding continuity. We\nestablish a generic characterisation of continuity for functions preserving\nregular languages under inverse image (such as regular functions). We exploit\nthis characterisation to show the decidability of continuity (and hence\ncomputability) of rational and regular functions. For rational functions, we\nshow that this can be done in $\\mathsf{NLogSpace}$ (it was already known to be\nin $\\mathsf{PTime}$ by Prieur).

Yet some important\nchallenges are still to be faced, including an optimal coupling between these\ntwo types of properties that would be effective within complex biological\ntissues. To address these points, we have prepared novel nanoplatforms\nassociating controlled drug delivery of doxorubicin and Magnetic Resonance\nImaging (MRI) contrast-enhancement that exhibit high specificity towards cancer\ncells compared to normal cells and evaluated them both in 2D cultures and\nwithin 3D tissue-like biomimetic matrices. Methods: Nanoplatforms were prepared\nfrom hollow silica nanoparticles coated with MnO2 nanosheets and conjugated\nwith the AS1411 aptamer as a targeting agent. They were fully characterized\nfrom a chemical and structural point of view as well as for drug release and\nMRI signal enhancement. Standard two-dimensional monolayer cultures were\nperformed using HeLa and Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) cells to\ntestify targeting and cytotoxicity. Cellularized type I collagen-based\nhydrogels were also used to study nanoparticles behavior in 3D biomimetic\nenvironments. Results: The as-established nanoplatforms can enter HeLa cells,\nleading to the dissociation of the MnO2 nanosheets into Mn 2+ that enhanced T1\nmagnetic resonance signals and concomitantly release doxorubicin, both effects\nbeing markedly more significant than in the presence of NHDFs. Moreover,\nparticles functionality and specificity were preserved when the cells were\nimmobilized within type I collagen-based fibrillar hydrogels. Conclusion: The\nuse of MnO2 nanosheets as glutathione-sensitive coatings of drug loaded\nnanoparticles together with surface conjugation with a targeting aptamer offers\nan effective strategy to obtain efficient and specific nanotheranostic systems\nfor cancer research, both in 2D and 3D.
