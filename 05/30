We study whether the same\npattern emerges when two neural networks, a \"speaker\" and a \"listener\", are\ntrained to play a signaling game. Surprisingly, we find that networks develop\nan \\emph{anti-efficient} encoding scheme, in which the most frequent inputs are\nassociated to the longest messages, and messages in general are skewed towards\nthe maximum length threshold. This anti-efficient code appears easier to\ndiscriminate for the listener, and, unlike in human communication, the speaker\ndoes not impose a contrasting least-effort pressure towards brevity.

A convenient storage device for photons is the key to\nmemory assisted quantum communication and computing. While even a simple\noptical fiber can act as a convenient and reliable storage device, its storage\ntime is tightly fixed and cannot be adapted. Therefore, the photon storage\nshould ideally be actively controllable by external means, such as magnetic or\nelectric control fields. In order to multiplex several photons, an active\nrouting would also be desirable. Here we show that single photons of a\nsemiconductor quantum dot can be deliberately delayed by an atomic vapor. Also,\nthe output path can be selected, depending on an external magnetic field. By\nselecting the input polarization of the photons and by aligning the external\nmagnetic field of the hot atomic vapor, the delay-based storage can be fine\ntuned to a deliberate value. With an overall delay of 25 ns, we are able to\nfine tune by more than 600 ps. Depending on the input polarization, the photons\nare routed into different output ports. The experimental data is fully\nresembled by a theoretical model, which describes the group velocity delay\nunder consideration of spectral diffusion and considers the complex refractive\nindex of the atomic vapor.

In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and\nmanually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this\ntype of fraud and of how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods\n(e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we present\nthe results of a multi-pronged investigation into the archetype of online\ndating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of\ndemographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the\nstrategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims\nthemselves. Further, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm\ncaused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on\nonline dating platforms. Our work presents the first system for automatically\ndetecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop\nromance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with\npotential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance\nscams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range\nof structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these\nbeliefs. No prior work has fully analyzed whether these notions of romance\nintroduce traits that could be leveraged to build a detection system.

Our models show that transport will always overcome the\ndepletion of CO$_2$ from the gas phase, and can also overcome the depletion of\nCO and CH$_4$ unless both transport is slow (viscous $\\alpha \\lesssim 10^{-3}$)\nand the ionization rate is high ($\\zeta \\approx 10^{-17}$). Including radial\ndrift further enhances the abundances of volatile species because they are\ncarried in on the surface of grains before evaporating left at their ice lines.\nDue to large differences in the abundances within 10 au for models with and\nwithout efficient radial drift, we argue that composition can be used to\nconstrain models of planet formation via pebble accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

Often, `color--metallicity relations' are\ninvoked to convert easier-to-obtain photometric measurements into\nmetallicities, but there is no consensus on what form these relations should\ntake. In this paper we make use of multiple photometric datasets and iron\nmetallicity values derived from applying full-spectrum stellar population\nsynthesis models to deep Keck/LRIS spectra of 177 GCs centrally located around\nM87 to obtain a new color--metallicity relation. Our new relation differs\nsubstantially from previous relations in the blue, and we present evidence that\nthe M87 relation differs from that of the Milky Way GCs, suggesting\nenvironmental dependence of GC properties. We use our color--metallicity\nrelation to derive a new GC metallicity-host galaxy luminosity relation for red\nand blue GCs and find a shallower relation for the blue GCs than what previous\nwork has found and that the metal-poor GCs are more enriched than what was\npreviously found. This could indicate that the progenitor satellite galaxies\nthat now make up the stellar halos of early-type galaxies are more massive and\nformed later than previously thought, or that the properties of metal-poor GCs\nare less dependent on their present-day host, indicating a common origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

One class of systematics\nthat requires careful study is instrumental systematics. The potential impact\nof such systematics is most readily understood by considering analysis\npipelines based on pair differencing. In this case, any differential gain,\npointing or beam ellipticity between the two detectors in a pair can result in\nintensity leakage into the $B$-mode spectrum, which needs to be controlled to a\nhigh precision due to the much greater magnitude of the total intensity signal\nas compared to the $B$-mode signal. One well known way to suppress such\nsystematics is through careful design of the scan-strategy, in particular\nmaking use of any capability to rotate the instrument about its pointing\n(boresight) direction. Here, we show that the combination of specific choices\nof such partial boresight rotation angles with redundancies present in the scan\nstrategy is a powerful approach for suppressing systematic effects. This\nmitigation can be performed in analysis in advance of map-making and, in\ncontrast to other approaches (e.g. deprojection or filtering), results in no\nsignal loss. We demonstrate our approach explicitly with time ordered data\nsimulations relevant to next-generation ground-based CMB experiments, using\ndeep and wide scan strategies appropriate for experiments based in Chile.

This low mass X-ray binary underwent an extraordinary outburst after\na long quiescence of 23 years, since its last major outburst in 1993. The\nsource was observed over two different epochs during 2017 April, 07 and 10. The\nbest fit joint spectral fitting in the energy range 0.5 $-$ 79.0 keV indicates\nthat the spectrum is best described by relatively cold, weak disk blackbody\nemission, dominant thermal Comptonization emission, and a relativistically\nbroadened fluorescent iron K$\\alpha$ emission line. We observed a clear\nindication of a Compton hump around 30 keV. We also detected an excess feature\nof $\\sim1.3$ keV. Assuming a lamp-post geometry of the corona, we constrained\nthe inner disk radius for both observations to 11.92$^{+8.62}_{-11.92}$\nR$_{ISCO}$ (i.e., an upper limit) and 10.39$^{+9.51}_{-3.02}$ R$_{ISCO}$ (where\nR$_{ISCO}\\equiv$ radius of the innermost stable circular orbit) for the first\nepoch (E1) and second epoch (E2), respectively. A significant ($\\sim5\\sigma$)\ntype$-$C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $1.20\\pm0.04$ Hz is detected for\nthe first time for GRS 1716--249, which drifts to $1.55\\pm0.04$ Hz\n($\\sim6\\sigma$) at the end of the second observation. The derived spectral and\ntemporal properties show a positive correlation between the QPO frequency and\nthe photon index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 18:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

We find that in the TESS\nbandpass the estimated contrast at optical wavelengths is typically <10 ppm\nexcept for the brightest, largest, or closest in planets with the highest\nlofted clouds where contrast can reach a few tens of ppm.

Our method\nbuilds on the observation that the location of object segments can be perturbed\nlocally relative to a given background without affecting the realism of a\nscene. Our approach is to first train a generative model of a layered scene.\nThe layered representation consists of a background image, a foreground image\nand the mask of the foreground. A composite image is then obtained by\noverlaying the masked foreground image onto the background. The generative\nmodel is trained in an adversarial fashion against a discriminator, which\nforces the generative model to produce realistic composite images. To force the\ngenerator to learn a representation where the foreground layer corresponds to\nan object, we perturb the output of the generative model by introducing a\nrandom shift of both the foreground image and mask relative to the background.\nBecause the generator is unaware of the shift before computing its output, it\nmust produce layered representations that are realistic for any such random\nperturbation. Finally, we learn to segment an image by defining an autoencoder\nconsisting of an encoder, which we train, and the pre-trained generator as the\ndecoder, which we freeze. The encoder maps an image to a feature vector, which\nis fed as input to the generator to give a composite image matching the\noriginal input image. Because the generator outputs an explicit layered\nrepresentation of the scene, the encoder learns to detect and segment objects.\nWe demonstrate this framework on real images of several object categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 18:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 17:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Moreover, this paper shows that some of the commonly used metrics\ntend to be biased in favour of graphs that minimise edges. While graphs that\nare less complex are desirable, some of the metrics favour underfitted graphs,\nthereby encouraging limited propagation of evidence. This paper proposes the\nBalanced Scoring Function (BSF) that eliminates this bias by adjusting the\nreward function based on the difficulty of discovering an edge, or no edge,\nproportional to their occurrence rate in the ground truth graph.

Instead, the two BHs of a given binary prefer to be of\ncomparable mass. We show that it is $\\sim 5$ times more likely that the\ncomponent BHs in a given binary are always equal (to within 5\\%) than that they\nare randomly paired. If we assume that the probability of a merger between two\nBHs scales with the mass ratio $q$ as $q^\\beta$, so that $\\beta=0$ corresponds\nto random pairings, we find $\\beta>0$ is favored at credibility 0.987. By\nmodeling the mass distribution, we find that the median mass ratio is $q_{50\\%}\n= 0.91^{+0.05}_{-0.17}$ at 90\\% credibility.

We derive single-letter upper bounds for the end-to-end capacities\nachievable by the most general (adaptive) protocols of quantum and private\ncommunication, from a single repeater chain to an arbitrarily-complex quantum\nnetwork, where systems may be routed through single or multiple paths. We\nanalytically establish these capacities under fundamental noise models,\nincluding bosonic loss which is the most important for optical communications.\nIn this way, our results provide the ultimate benchmarks for testing the\noptimal performance of repeater-assisted quantum communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 18:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

However, one challenge for 2D image-based systems is that they cannot\nprovide accurate 3D location information. This is critical for location\nsensitive applications such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. On the\nother hand, 3D methods, such as RGB-D and RGB-LiDAR based systems, can provide\nsolutions that significantly improve the RGB only approaches. That is why this\nis an interesting research area for both industry and academia. Compared with\n2D image-based systems, 3D-based systems are more complicated due to the\nfollowing five reasons: 1) Data representation itself is more complicated. 3D\nimages can be represented by point clouds, meshes, volumes. 2D images have\npixel grid representations. 2) The computation and memory resource requirement\nis higher as an extra dimension is added. 3) Different distribution of the\nobjects and difference in scene areas between indoor and outdoor make one\nunified framework hard to achieve. 4) 3D data, especially for the outdoor\nscenario, is sparse compared with the dense 2D images which makes the detection\ntask more challenging. Finally, large size labelled datasets, which are\nextremely important for supervised based algorithms, are still under\nconstruction compared with well-built 2D datasets such as ImageNet.

To\nimprove on this, we introduce hyperplane-valued multivariate M-quantiles that\nshow strong advantages, for instance in terms of equivariance, over the various\npoint-valued multivariate M-quantiles available in the literature. Like their\ncompetitors, our multivariate M-quantiles are directional in nature and provide\ncentrality regions when all directions are considered. These regions define a\nnew statistical depth, the halfspace M-depth, whose deepest point, in the\nexpectile case, is the mean vector. Remarkably, the halfspace M-depth can\nalternatively be obtained by substituting, in the celebrated Tukey (1975)\nhalfspace depth, M-quantile outlyingness for standard quantile outlyingness,\nwhich supports a posteriori the claim that our multivariate M-quantile concept\nis the natural one. We investigate thoroughly the properties of the proposed\nmultivariate M-quantiles, of halfspace M-depth, and of the corresponding\nregions. Since our original motivation was to define multiple-output expectile\nregression methods, we further focus on the expectile case. We show in\nparticular that expectile depth is smoother than the Tukey depth and enjoys\ninteresting monotonicity properties that are extremely promising for\ncomputational purposes. Unlike their quantile analogs, the proposed\nmultivariate expectiles also satisfy the coherency axioms of multivariate risk\nmeasures. Finally, we show that our multivariate expectiles indeed allow\nperforming multiple-output expectile regression, which is illustrated on\nsimulated and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 20:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

However,\nlittle attention has been given to the more empirical question of how often an\nexact solution might be given to a question despite the question being, at\nleast in theory, undecidable. This paper investigates this issue by exploring\nsub-Turing islands -- regions of code for which a question of interest is\ndecidable. We define such islands and then consider how to identify them. We\nimplemented Cook, a prototype for finding sub-Turing islands and applied it to\na corpus of 1100 Android applications, containing over 2 million methods.\nResults reveal that 55\\% of the all methods are sub-Turing. Our results also\nprovide empirical, scientific evidence for the scalability of sub-Turing island\nidentification. Sub-Turing identification has many downstream applications,\nbecause islands are so amenable to static analysis. We illustrate two\ndownstream uses of the analysis. In the first, we found that over 37\\% of the\nverification conditions associated with runtime exceptions fell within\nsub-Turing islands and thus are statically decidable. A second use of our\nanalysis is during code review where it provides guidance to developers. The\nsub-Turing islands from our study turns out to contain significantly fewer bugs\nthan `theswamp' (non sub-Turing methods). The greater bug density in the swamp\nis unsurprising; the fact that bugs remain prevalent in islands is, however,\nsurprising: these are bugs whose repair can be fully automated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 21:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

This finding suggests the formation of Te vacancies which have been\nreported to lower the energy difference between the 2H and 1T' phase,\npotentially aiding the phase change process. Our discovery that the phase\nchange can be achieved on the surface layer of bulk materials reveals that this\nelectrochemical mechanism does not require isolation of a single layer and the\neffect may be more broadly applicable than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 21:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

The main\nidea is that different segments of a program can be compiled with different\ncompilers/optimizers and combined into a single executable. The MCompiler can\nbe used in a number of ways. It can generate an executable with higher\nperformance than any individual compiler, because each compiler uses a\nspecific, ordered set of optimization techniques and different profitability\nmodels and can, therefore, generate code significantly different from other\ncompilers. Alternatively, the MCompiler can be used by researchers and compiler\ndevelopers to evaluate their compiler implementation and compare it to results\nfrom other available compilers/optimizers.\n  A code segment in this work is a loop nest, but other choices are possible.\nThis work also investigates the use of Machine Learning to learn inherent\ncharacteristics of loop nests and then predict during compilation the most\nsuited code optimizer for each loop nest in an application. This reduces the\nneed for profiling applications as well as the compilation time.\n  The results show that our framework improves the overall performance for\napplications over state-of-the-art compilers by a geometric mean of 1.96x for\nauto-vectorized code and 2.62x for auto-parallelized code. Parallel\napplications with OpenMP directives are also improved by the MCompiler, with a\ngeometric mean performance improvement of 1.04x (up to 1.74x). The use of\nMachine Learning prediction achieves performance very close to the\nprofiling-based search for choosing the most suited code optimizer: within 4%\nfor auto-vectorized code and within 8% for auto-parallelized code. Finally, the\nMCompiler can be expanded to collect metrics other than performance to be used\nin optimization process.

The author argues that FN plots should be made using raw\nexperimental current-voltage data, and that an orthodoxy test should be applied\nto the resulting FN plot before any more-detailed analysis, and that (in view\nof growing concerns over the reliability of published \"scientific\" results)\nreviewers should scrutinize field emission materials-characterization papers\nwith enhanced care.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 22:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

As a point of departure, we\ncharacterise the conditions under which one can solve the problem with such\npartial observability. Next, we propose a practical estimator and compute\nconfidence intervals for it in terms of the elapsed time between the\nobservations.

Here we present the first experimental demonstration of a\nwaveguide-integrated DLA, designed using a photonic inverse design approach.\nThese on-chip devices accelerate sub-relativistic electrons of initial energy\n83.4 keV by 1.21 keV over 30 um, providing peak acceleration gradients of 40.3\nMeV/m. This progress represents a significant step towards a completely\nintegrated MeV-scale dielectric laser accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 01:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The upper bound for the convergence rates thus obtained typically\nmatches the minimax lower bound when the entropy integral converges, but admits\na strict gap compared to the lower bound when it diverges. Birg\\'e and Massart\n[BM93] provided a striking example showing that such a gap is real with the\nentropy structure alone: for a variant of the natural H\\\"older class with low\nregularity, the global ERM actually converges at the rate predicted by the\nentropy integral that substantially deviates from the lower bound. The\ncounter-example has spawned a long-standing negative position on the use of\nglobal ERMs in the regime where the entropy integral diverges, as they are\nheuristically believed to converge at a sub-optimal rate in a variety of\nmodels.\n  The present paper demonstrates that this gap can be closed if the models\nadmit certain degree of `set structures' in addition to the entropy structure.\nIn other words, the global ERMs in such set structured models will indeed be\nrate-optimal, matching the lower bound even when the entropy integral diverges.\nThe models with set structures we investigate include (i) image and edge\nestimation, (ii) binary classification, (iii) multiple isotonic regression,\n(iv) $s$-concave density estimation, all in general dimensions when the entropy\nintegral diverges.

In theory, the method generates lower\nand upper bounds of $y^*$ both converging to $y^*$. Their convergence is\nquadratic if the right derivative of $g$ at $y^*$ is positive. Accurate\ncomputation of $g'(y)$ is necessary for the robustness of the method, but it is\ndifficult to achieve in practice. As an alternative, we present a\nsecant-bracketing method.

To\nevaluate and improve the effectiveness of watermark, watermark removal attracts\nincreasing attention and becomes a hot research top. Current methods cast the\nwatermark removal as an image-to-image translation problem where the\nencode-decode architectures with pixel-wise loss are adopted to transfer the\ntransparent watermarked pixels into unmarked pixels. However, when a number of\nrealistic images are presented, the watermarks are more likely to be unknown\nand diverse (i.e., the watermarks might be opaque or semi-transparent; the\ncategory and pattern of watermarks are unknown). When applying existing methods\nto the real-world scenarios, they mostly can not satisfactorily reconstruct the\nhidden information obscured under the complex and various watermarks (i.e., the\nresidual watermark traces remain and the reconstructed images lack reality). To\naddress this difficulty, in this paper, we present a new watermark processing\nframework using the conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for\nvisible watermark removal in the real-world application. The proposed method\nenables the watermark removal solution to be more closed to the photo-realistic\nreconstruction using a patch-based discriminator conditioned on the watermarked\nimages, which is adversarially trained to differentiate the difference between\nthe recovered images and original watermark-free images. Extensive experimental\nresults on a large-scale visible watermark dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and clearly indicate that our proposed\napproach can produce more photo-realistic and convincing results compared with\nthe state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 04:08:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 02:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 05:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

In order\nto address some of these challenges, we introduce sparse projected gradient\ndescent (SPGD), a new approach to crafting interpretable adversarial examples\nfor text.

Excellent solutions have been\ndemonstrated mostly in image processing applications which involve large,\ncontinuous output spaces. There is almost no application of these powerful\ntools to problems having small dimensional output spaces. Regression problems\ninvolving the inductive learning of a map, $y=f(x,z)$, $z$ denoting noise,\n$f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\times \\mathbb{R}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$, with $m$ small\n(e.g., $m=1$ or just a few) is one good case in point. The standard approach to\nsolve regression problems is to probabilistically model the output $y$ as the\nsum of a mean function $m(x)$ and a noise term $z$; it is also usual to take\nthe noise to be a Gaussian. These are done for convenience sake so that the\nlikelihood of observed data is expressible in closed form. In the real world,\non the other hand, stochasticity of the output is usually caused by missing or\nnoisy input variables.

The highest-energy\nemission has generally been attributed to pion production from the interaction\nof >300 MeV protons with the ambient matter. The extended duration suggests\nthat particle acceleration occurs over large volumes extending high in the\ncorona, either from stochastic acceleration within large coronal loops or from\nback precipitation from coronal mass ejection driven shocks.

We pose the choice of warping\nfunction as an optimization problem with several terms in the objective. The\nfirst term measures the misalignment of the time-warped signals. Two additional\nregularization terms penalize the cumulative warping and the instantaneous rate\nof time warping; constraints on the warping can be imposed by assigning the\nvalue +inf to the regularization terms. Different choices of the three\nobjective terms yield different time warping functions that trade off signal\nfit or alignment and properties of the warping function. The optimization\nproblem we formulate is a classical optimal control problem, with initial and\nterminal constraints, and a state dimension of one.

Moreover, some of them are expected to lead to the\nmultiple-ring structure formation and the planetesimal formation in\nprotoplanetary disks. In a turbulent gaseous disk, the growth of the\ninstabilities and the dust accumulation are quenched by turbulent diffusion of\ndust grains. The diffusion process has been often modeled by a diffusion term\nin the continuity equation for the dust density. The dust diffusion model,\nhowever, does not guarantee the angular momentum conservation in a disk. In\nthis study, we first formulate equations that describe the dust diffusion and\nalso conserve the total angular momentum of a disk. Second, we perform the\nlinear perturbation analysis on the secular gravitational instability (GI)\nusing the equations. The results show that the secular GI is a monotonically\ngrowing mode, contrary to the result of previous analyses that found it\noverstable. We find that the overstability is caused by the non-conservation of\nthe angular momentum. Third, we find a new axisymmetric instability due to the\ncombination of the dust-gas friction and the turbulent gas viscosity, which we\nrefer to as two-component viscous gravitational instability (TVGI). The most\nunstable wavelength of TVGI is comparable to or smaller than the gas scale\nheight. TVGI accumulates dust grains efficiently, which indicates that TVGI is\na promising mechanism for the formation of multiple-ring-like structures and\nplanetesimals. Finally, we examine the validity of the ring formation via the\nsecular GI and TVGI in the HL Tau disk and find both instabilities can create\nmultiple rings whose width is about 10 au at orbital radii larger than 50 au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 07:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

The local well-posedness, the\nglobal well-posedness, and asymptotics of solutions as time goes to infinity\nare studied in the Lp in time and Lq in space framework. The tool in proving\nthe local well-posedness is the maximal Lp-Lq regularity for the Stokes\nequations with non-homogeneous free boundary conditions. The approach here of\nproving the maximal Lp-Lq regularity is based on the R bounded solution\noperators of the generalized resolvent problem for the Stokes equations with\nnon-homogeneous free boundary conditions and the Weis operator valued Fourier\nmultiplier.\n  The key issue of proving the global well-posedness for the strong solutions\nis the decay properties of Stokes semigroup, which are derived by spectral\nanalysis of the Stokes operator in the bulk space and the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator on the boundary.

In particular, in studying the exterior domain case,\nit is essential to choose different exponents p and q.

A common problem in these devices is the\npixel crosstalk, also called the fringing field effect, which causes the\nresponse of these devices to deviate from the ideal behavior. This fringing\neffect decreases the performance of the spatial light modulator and is shown to\ncause an asymmetry in the diffraction efficiency between positive and negative\ndiffraction orders. We use simulations of the director distribution to\nreproduce diffraction efficiency measurements of binary and blazed gratings. To\novercome these limitations in performance, the simulations of the director\ndistribution in the liquid crystal layer are used to develop a fast and precise\nmodel to compute the phase response of the spatial light modulator. To\ncompensate the fringing field effect, we implement this model in phase\nretrieval algorithms and calculate the phase profile corresponding to a regular\nspot pattern as a generic example. With this method, we are able to increase\nthe spot uniformity significantly compared to a calculation without considering\nthe fringing field effect. Additionally, polarization conversion efficiencies\nof various simple phase patterns are simulated and measured for different\norientations of the spatial light modulator.

The problem incurs\nprohibitive cost under canonical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the\nsource due to the exponential number of possible infection paths. Our main idea\nof source detection, however, is to approximate the MLE by an alternative\ninfection path based estimator, the essence of which is to identify the most\nlikely infection path that is consistent with observed timestamps. The source\nnode associated with that infection path is viewed as the estimated source\n$\\hat{v}$. We first study the case of tree topology, where by transforming the\ninfection path based estimator into a linear integer programming, we find a\nreduced search region that remarkably improves the time efficiency. Within this\nreduced search region, the estimator $\\hat{v}$ is provably always on a path\nwhich we term as \\emph{candidate path}. This notion enables us to analyze the\ndistribution of $d(v^{\\ast},\\hat{v})$, the error distance between $\\hat{v}$ and\nthe true source $v^{\\ast}$, on arbitrary tree, which allows us to obtain for\nthe first time, in the literature provable performance guarantee of the\nestimator under limited timestamps. Specifically, on the infinite $g$-regular\ntree with uniform sampled timestamps, we get a refined performance guarantee in\nthe sense of a constant bounded $d(v^{\\ast},\\hat{v})$. By virtue of time\nlabeled BFS tree, the estimator still performs fairly well when extended to\nmore general graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets further\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 08:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-02"}

Plasticity on a short time scale therefore\nonly happens in the incoming and outgoing connections of CA3. Stored sequences\ncan later be recalled from a single cue pattern.

GMC\nalso combines memory gradient and momentum SGD. But different from DGC which\nadopts local momentum, GMC adopts global momentum. We theoretically prove the\nconvergence rate of GMC for both convex and non-convex problems. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work that proves the convergence of\ndistributed momentum SGD~(DMSGD) with sparse communication and memory gradient.\nEmpirical results show that, compared with the DMSGD counterpart without sparse\ncommunication, GMC can reduce the communication cost by approximately 100 fold\nwithout loss of generalization accuracy. GMC can also achieve\ncomparable~(sometimes better) performance compared with DGC, with extra\ntheoretical guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 10:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 16:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

These phase transitions\nare highly nonlinear and strongly coupled, and cause the mathematical model to\nrapidly switch the phase states and pose serious convergence issues for the\nclassical Newton's method. One of the common methods of dealing with such phase\ntransitions is the primary variable switching (PVS) method where the choice of\nthe primary variables is adapted locally to the phase state **outside** the\nNewton loop. In order to ensure that the phase states are determined\naccurately, the PVS strategy requires an additional iterative loop, which can\nget quite expensive for highly nonlinear problems.

Here we study electron\ntransport through this network and report giant Aharonov-Bohm oscillations\npersisting to temperatures above 100 K. At liquid helium temperatures, the\nnetwork resistivity exhibits another kind of oscillations that appear as a\nfunction of carrier density and are accompanied by a sign-changing Hall effect.\nThe latter are attributed to consecutive population of the flat minibands\nformed by the 2D network of 1D states inside the gap. Our work shows that\nmarginally twisted BLG is markedly distinct from other 2D electronic systems,\nincluding BLG at larger twist angles, and offers a fascinating venue for\nfurther research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 11:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 15:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

The earliest variable stars were large\namplitude, radial pulsators but were followed by other classes of pulsating\nstars. As the field matured, we outline some cornerstones of research into\npulsating star research with an emphasis on changes in observational\ntechniques. Improvements from photographs, to photometry, CCDs, and space\ntelescopes allowed researchers to separate out pulsating stars from other stars\nwith light variations, recognize radial and nonradial pulsation courtesy of\nincreased measurement precision, and then use nonradial pulsations to look\ninside the stars, which cannot be done any other way.

As the result of technical changes,\nthe structure of international organizations devoted to pulsating stars has\nchanged, and an increasing number of conferences specialized to space missions\nor themes are held.

We show the conditions in which Samarium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Holmium,\nDysprosium and Thulium garnets may possess PMA on the investigated garnet\nsubstrate types. Guidelines for obtaining garnet films with low damping are\npresented. New PMA garnet films with tunable saturation moment and field may\nimprove spin-orbit torque memory and compensated magnonic thin film devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 13:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Instead, inspired by the consciousness prior proposed\nby Yoshua Bengio, we explore reasoning with the notion of attentive awareness\nfrom a cognitive perspective, and formulate it in the form of attentive message\npassing on graphs, called neural consciousness flow (NeuCFlow). Aiming to\nbridge the gap between deep learning systems and reasoning, we propose an\nattentive computation framework with a three-layer architecture, which consists\nof an unconsciousness flow layer, a consciousness flow layer, and an attention\nflow layer.

A corpus of\npotential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of\ndiversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all\navailable seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g.,\nafl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range\nof instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests\nthat minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more\nefficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically.\n  We present results of 34+ CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation\napproaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software.\nWe evaluate a number of techniques, includibng the existing afl-cmin and\nMinset, and also MoonLight---a freely available, configurable,\nstate-of-the-art, open-source, tool.\n  Our experiments compare the effectiveness of distillation approaches,\ntargeting the Google Fuzzer Test Suite and a diverse set of six real-world\nlibraries and programs, covering 13 different input file formats across 16\nprograms.

This in turn yields\nhigh short circuit current and hence excellent solar efficiency for few\ncompounds namely CsVN$_2$ and RbVN$_2$. Along with excellent absorption\nquality, some compounds show favorable band edge positions compared to water\nredox levels and hence are promising as photoelectrodes in\nphoto(electro)chemical water splitting devices. Mixture of flat and dispersive\nbands in the band structure yields both high Seebeck and electrical\nconductivity, thus excellent power factor for seven compounds. Simulated\nlattice thermal conductivity shows moderate to ultralow values and thus the\npossibility of achieving high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT), even at\nlower temperatures. From the experimental perspective, we discuss the possible\nchallenges that may arise while utilizing these compounds for the desired\napplications, and suggest possible pathways to overcome them. We believe such\ntheoretical prediction of promising materials are extremely useful for new\nmaterials discovery and anticipate rapid response from the experimental\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 14:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 22:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

On the other hand,\nmany real-world problems require relatively small adjustments from the status\nquo policies to achieve improved performance. Therefore, we propose a\nstudent-teacher RL mechanism in which the RL (the \"student\") learns to maximize\nits reward, subject to a constraint that bounds the difference between the RL\npolicy and the \"teacher\" policy. The teacher can be another RL policy (e.g.,\ntrained under a slightly different setting), the status quo policy, or any\nother exogenous policy.

Thus, they fail to capture the\nhigher-order characteristics at the level of small dense subgraph patterns,\ne.g., motifs. Recently, some higher-order methods have been developed but they\ntypically focus on the motif-based hypergraph which is assumed to be a\nconnected graph. However, such assumption cannot be ensured in some real-world\nnetworks. In particular, the hypergraph may become fragmented. That is, it may\nconsist of a large number of connected components and isolated nodes, despite\nthe fact that the original network is a connected graph. Therefore, the\nexisting higher-order methods would suffer seriously from the above\nfragmentation issue, since in these approaches, nodes without connection in\nhypergraph can't be grouped together even if they belong to the same community.\nTo address the above fragmentation issue, we propose an Edge enhancement\napproach for Motif-aware community detection (EdMot). The main idea is as\nfollows. Firstly, a motif-based hypergraph is constructed and the top K largest\nconnected components in the hypergraph are partitioned into modules.\nAfterwards, the connectivity structure within each module is strengthened by\nconstructing an edge set to derive a clique from each module. Based on the new\nedge set, the original connectivity structure of the input network is enhanced\nto generate a rewired network, whereby the motif-based higher-order structure\nis leveraged and the hypergraph fragmentation issue is well addressed. Finally,\nthe rewired network is partitioned to obtain the higher-order community\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 15:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

In the specialized\ndomain of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Social IoV (SIoV) is introduced\nrealization its importance. Assuming a more commonly acceptable standardization\nof Big Data generated by IoV, the social dimensions enabling its fruitful usage\nremains a challenge. In this paper, an agent-based model of information sharing\nbetween vehicles for context-aware recommendations is presented. The model\nadheres to social dimensions as that of human society. Some important\nhypotheses are tested under reasonable connectivity and data constraints. The\nsimulation results reveal that closure of social ties and its timing impacts\ndispersion of novel information (necessary for a recommender system)\nsubstantially. It was also observed that as the network evolves as a result of\nincremental interactions, recommendations guaranteeing a fair distribution of\nvehicles across equally good competitors is not possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 06:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}
