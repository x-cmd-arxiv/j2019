The existing depth-based and RGB+D-based action recognition\nbenchmarks have a number of limitations, including the lack of large-scale\ntraining samples, realistic number of distinct class categories, diversity in\ncamera views, varied environmental conditions, and variety of human subjects.\nIn this work, we introduce a large-scale dataset for RGB+D human action\nrecognition, which is collected from 106 distinct subjects and contains more\nthan 114 thousand video samples and 8 million frames. This dataset contains 120\ndifferent action classes including daily, mutual, and health-related\nactivities. We evaluate the performance of a series of existing 3D activity\nanalysis methods on this dataset, and show the advantage of applying deep\nlearning methods for 3D-based human action recognition. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate a novel one-shot 3D activity recognition problem on our dataset,\nand a simple yet effective Action-Part Semantic Relevance-aware (APSR)\nframework is proposed for this task, which yields promising results for\nrecognition of the novel action classes. We believe the introduction of this\nlarge-scale dataset will enable the community to apply, adapt, and develop\nvarious data-hungry learning techniques for depth-based and RGB+D-based human\nactivity understanding.

Cooling its hydrogen-disordered counterpart ice\nVII doped with 2.5 mol% ND4F under pressure leads to a hydrogen-disordered ice\nVIII with ~31% residual hydrogen disorder illustrating the long-range\nhydrogen-disordering effect of ND4F.

This requires analyzing goal\nmodels along with their semantics. However, most prominent goal modeling\nframeworks have no means of capturing the semantics of goals (except what is\ntrivially conveyed by their nomenclature).\n  Objective: In this paper, we propose the Annotation of Functional\nSatisfaction Conditions and their Reconciliation (AFSCR) framework for doing\nthe same. The entire framework is presented with respect to i* modeling\nconstructs.\n  Method: This is a semi-automated framework that requires analysts to annotate\nindividual goals with their immediate goal satisfaction conditions. The AFSCR\nframework can then reconcile these satisfaction conditions for every goal and\nverify whether the derived set of cumulative satisfaction conditions is in\nharmony with the intended set of goal satisfaction conditions.\n  Result: If the derived and intended sets of satisfaction conditions are in\nconflict, the framework raises entailment and/or consistency flags. Whenever a\nconflict is flagged, the framework also provides alternate solutions and\npossible workaround strategies to the analysts by refactoring the given i*\nmodel.\n  Conclusion: In this paper we present a new framework that uses satisfaction\nconditions for going beyond the nomenclature and capturing the functional\nsemantics of the goals within i* models. The analysis performed during the\nreconciliation process is generic enough and can be adapted to any goal\nmodeling framework if required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 19:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Systems like Smart Grids, Transportation, and Healthcare help us\nrun our lives and businesses smoothly, successfully and safely. Since\nmalfunctions in these CPSs can have serious, expensive, sometimes fatal\nconsequences, System-Level Formal Verification (SLFV) tools are vital to\nminimise the likelihood of errors occurring during the development process and\nbeyond. Their applicability is supported by the increasingly widespread use of\nModel Based Design (MBD) tools. MBD enables the simulation of CPS models in\norder to check for their correct behaviour from the very initial design phase.\nThe disadvantage is that SLFV for complex CPSs is an extremely time-consuming\nprocess, which typically requires several months of simulation. Current SLFV\ntools are aimed at accelerating the verification process with multiple\nsimulators that work simultaneously. To this end, they compute all the\nscenarios in advance in such a way as to split and simulate them in parallel.\nFurthermore, they compute optimised simulation campaigns in order to simulate\ncommon prefixes of these scenarios only once, thus avoiding redundant\nsimulation. Nevertheless, there are still limitations that prevent a more\nwidespread adoption of SLFV tools. Firstly, current tools cannot optimise\nsimulation campaigns from existing datasets with collected scenarios. Secondly,\nthere are currently no methods to predict the time required to complete the\nSLFV process. This lack of ability to predict the length of the process makes\nscheduling verification activities highly problematic.

The outcome is\na discrete ensemble of local subalgebras of ``macroscopic observables''\ncharacterizing a measuring scale. A set of evaluations of those macroscopic\nobservables is called an extended lattice gauge field because it determines a\n$G$-bundle over $M$ (and over submanifolds of $M$ that inherit a cellular\ndecomposition) together with a lattice gauge field over an embedded lattice. A\nphysical observable in our algebra of macroscopic observables is constructed.\nAn initial study of aspects of regularization and coarse graining, which are\nspecial to this description of gauge fields over a combinatorial base, is\npresented.

RPA+ is by construction exact for the homogeneous electron gas, and\nit is also accurate for the jellium surface. RPA+ often gives realistic total\nenergies for atoms or solids in which spin-polarization corrections are absent\nor small. RPA and RPA+ also yield realistic singlet binding energy curves for\nH2 and N2, and thus RPA+ yields correct total energies even for\nspin-unpolarized atoms with fractional spins and strong correlation, as in\nstretched H2 or N2. However, RPA and RPA+ can be very wrong for spin-polarized\none-electron systems (especially for stretched H2+), and also for the\nspin-polarization energies of atoms. The spin-polarization energy is often a\nsmall part of the total energy of an atom, but important for ionization\nenergies, electron affinities, and the atomization energies of molecules.

Unfortunately, due to the need to handle an\nadditional large number of unknowns in a problem that already suffers from\nill-posedness, model error estimation remains an unresolved challenge.

This prior is used in a posterior\nregularized Bayesian formulation to quantify the error in a priori EP model\nduring the reconstruction of transmural action potential from ECG data.

The produced powder was used for the preparation of recycled SmCo5\nmagnets. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,\nX-ray diffraction studies and magnetic measurements were used to follow the\ndecrepitation and the sintering processes. The measured remanence and maximum\nenergy product of the recycled magnet are 0.94 T and 171.1 kJ/m3, respectively,\nin comparison with 0.91 T and 156.8 kJ/m3, respectively for the original magnet\nbefore recycling. It was also observed that, there is refinement in the\nmicrostructure after recycling in comparison to the original magnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 02:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Although many face related fields (e.g., face recognition and face\ndetection) have been well studied for many years, the existing datasets for\nface parsing are still severely limited in terms of the scale and quality,\ne.g., the widely used Helen dataset only contains 2,330 images. This is mainly\nbecause pixel-level annotation is a high cost and time-consuming work,\nespecially for the facial parts without clear boundaries. The lack of accurate\nannotated datasets becomes a major obstacle in the progress of face parsing\ntask. It is a feasible way to utilize dense facial landmarks to guide the\nparsing annotation. However, annotating dense landmarks on human face\nencounters the same issues as the parsing annotation. To overcome the above\nproblems, in this paper, we develop a high-efficiency framework for face\nparsing annotation, which considerably simplifies and speeds up the parsing\nannotation by two consecutive modules. Benefit from the proposed framework, we\nconstruct a new Dense Landmark Guided Face Parsing (LaPa) benchmark. It\nconsists of 22,000 face images with large variations in expression, pose,\nocclusion, etc. Each image is provided with accurate annotation of a\n11-category pixel-level label map along with coordinates of 106-point\nlandmarks. To the best of our knowledge, it is currently the largest public\ndataset for face parsing. To make full use of our LaPa dataset with abundant\nface shape and boundary priors, we propose a simple yet effective\nBoundary-Sensitive Parsing Network (BSPNet). Our network is taken as a baseline\nmodel on the proposed LaPa dataset, and meanwhile, it achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Helen dataset without resorting to extra\nface alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 02:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

To reduce the power consumption and circuit cost for mmWave\nsystems, hybrid digital and analog (HDA) architecture is preferred in such a\nscenario. In this paper, an artificial-noise (AN) aided secure HDA beamforming\nscheme is proposed for mmWave MISO system with low resolution digital-to-analog\nconverters (DACs) and finite-quantized phase shifters on RF. The additive\nquantization noise model for AN aided HDA system is established to make an\nanalysis of the secrecy performance of such systems.

Adopting a similar framework for\nteaching robots through demonstrations and coaching makes teaching tasks highly\nintuitive. Unlike traditional Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approaches\nwhich require multiple demonstrations, we present a one-shot learning from\ndemonstration approach to learn tasks. The learnt task is corrected and\ngeneralized using two layers of evaluation/modification. First, the robot\nself-evaluates its performance and corrects the performance to be closer to the\ndemonstrated task. Then, coaching is used as a means to extend the policy\nlearnt to be adaptable to varying task goals. Both the self-evaluation and\ncoaching are implemented using reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Coaching is\nachieved through human feedback on desired goal and action modification to\ngeneralize to specified task goals. The proposed approach is evaluated with a\nscooping task, by presenting a single demonstration. The self-evaluation\nframework aims to reduce the resistance to scooping in the media. To reduce the\nsearch space for RL, we bootstrap the search using least resistance path\nobtained using resistive force theory.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a synchronous bidirectional neural machine translation (SB-NMT) that\npredicts its outputs using left-to-right and right-to-left decoding\nsimultaneously and interactively, in order to leverage both of the history and\nfuture information at the same time. Specifically, we first propose a new\nalgorithm that enables synchronous bidirectional decoding in a single model.\nThen, we present an interactive decoding model in which left-to-right\n(right-to-left) generation does not only depend on its previously generated\noutputs, but also relies on future contexts predicted by right-to-left\n(left-to-right) decoding. We extensively evaluate the proposed SB-NMT model on\nlarge-scale NIST Chinese-English, WMT14 English-German, and WMT18\nRussian-English translation tasks.

We model the UVLF\nover cosmic history with a semi-empirical framework and include a log-normal\nscatter, $\\Sigma$, in galaxy luminosities with a conditional luminosity\nfunction approach. We show that stochasticity induces a flattening or a\nfeedback scale in the median galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation,\n$L_{c}(M_{h})$ to account for the increase of bright objects placed in lower\nmass halos. We observe a natural broadening in the bright-end exponential\nsegment of the UVLF for $z>6$ if processes that regulate star-formation acts on\nthe same mass scale as at $z\\sim5$, where the degree of broadening is enhanced\nfor larger $\\Sigma$. Alternatively, if the bright-end feedback is triggered at\na near-constant luminosity threshold, the feedback threshold occurs at\nprogressively lower halo masses with increasing redshift, due to galaxies being\nmore luminous on average at a fixed halo mass from rapid halo assembly. Such\nfeedback results in a LF shape with a bright-end closer to that of a Schechter\nfunction.

So the key task of G-ReID is to learn\nrepresentations robust to such changes. To address this issue, we propose a\nTransferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). Its\nmerits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of labelled training samples,\nexisting G-ReID methods mainly rely on unsatisfactory hand-crafted features.

They have proved to be effective for\nguiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg\nas opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better\nand have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current\nmethods for regional dropout remove informative pixels on training images by\noverlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not\ndesirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during\ntraining. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are\ncut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also\nmixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of\ntraining pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout,\nCutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on\nCIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet\nweakly-supervised localization task.

Current numerical simulations of\nthe geodynamo, however, operate at much larger inertia and viscosity because of\ncomputational limitations. This casts some doubt on the physical relevance of\nthese models. Our work aims at finding dynamo models in a moderate\ncomputational regime which reproduce the leading-order force balance of the\nEarth. By performing a systematic parameter space survey with Ekman numbers in\nthe range $10^{-6} \\leq E \\leq 10^{-4}$, we study the variations of the force\nbalance when changing the forcing (Rayleigh number, $Ra$) and the ratio between\nviscous and magnetic diffusivities (magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$). For\ndipole-dominated dynamos, we observe that the force balance is structurally\nrobust throughout the investigated parameter space, exhibiting a\nquasi-geostrophic (QG) balance (balance between Coriolis and pressure forces)\nat zeroth order, followed by a first-order MAC balance between the ageostrophic\nCoriolis, buoyancy and Lorentz forces. At second order this balance is\ndisturbed by contributions from inertia and viscous forces. Dynamos with a\ndifferent sequence of the forces, where inertia and/or viscosity replace the\nLorentz force in the first-order force balance, can only be found close to the\nonset of dynamo action and in the multipolar regime. Our study illustrates that\nmost classical numerical dynamos are controlled by a QG-MAC balance, while\ncases where viscosity and inertia play a dominant role are the exception rather\nthan the norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 09:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

The effect\nof those same fluctuations on the pressure and temperature dependence of the\nferroelectric soft phonon mode as the system is tuned away from criticality are\nreported for the first time in this paper. We show that the mean field\napproximation is confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, using a self-consistent\nmodel of the quantum critical excitations including coupling to the volume\nstrain and without adjustable parameters, we determine logarithmic corrections\nthat would be observable only very close to the quantum critical point. Thus,\nthe mean-field character of the pressure dependence is much more robust to the\nfluctuations than is the temperature dependence. We predict stronger\ncorrections for lower dimensionalities however. The same calculation confirms\nthat the Lydanne-Sachs-Teller relation is valid over the whole pressure and\ntemperature range considered. Therefore, the measured dielectric constant can\nbe used to extract the frequency of the soft mode down to 1.5 K and up to 20\nkbar of applied pressure. The soft mode is observed to stiffen further, raising\nthe low-temperature energy gap and returning towards the expected shallow\ntemperature dependence of an optical mode. This behavior is consistent with the\nexistence of a quantum critical point on the pressure-temperature phase diagram\nof STO, which applied pressure tunes the system away from.

Different single crystal (001)-oriented substrates, i.e.,\nSrTiO3(001), MgAl2O4(001) and MgO(001), have been used for the preparation of\nepitaxial Fe3O4(001) films. By comparison, polycrystalline magnetite films were\nobtained on both single crystal Al2O3(0001) and amorphous Si/SiO2 substrates.\nThe thickness has been varied between 50 - 400 nm. All films consist of\nnanocrystalline stoichiometric magnetite with very small strain (<1\\%) and\npresent the Verwey transition (Tv) between 110-120 K, i.e., close to bulk\nmagnetite (122 K). In general, Tv depends on both microstructure and thickness,\nincreasing mainly as the thickness increases. Room temperature\nangular-dependent measurements reveal an in-plane fourfold symmetry magnetic\nbehavior for all films grown on (001)-oriented surfaces, and with the easy axes\nlying along the Fe3O4 [010] and [100] directions. Remarkably, the fourfold\nmagnetic symmetry shows up to 400 nm thick films. In turn, the films grown on\nsingle crystal Al2O3 (0001) and on amorphous Si/SiO2 surfaces display an\nisotropic magnetic behavior. Coercive field (Hc) depends on microstructure and\nfilm thickness. The largest (lowest) Hc value corresponds to the thinner film\ngrown on a single crystal SrTiO3(001) (amorphous Si/SiO2) surface, which\npresent the largest (lowest) strain (crystallinity). Moreover, the coercivity\nfollows an inverse law with film thickness.

A\ngene family evolves along the branches of a species tree through various\nmechanisms, including - but not limited to - speciation, gene duplication, gene\nloss, horizontal gene transfer. The reconstruction of a gene tree representing\nthe evolution of a gene family constrained by a species tree is an important\nproblem in phylogenomics. However, unlike in the multispecies coalescent\nevolutionary model, very little is known about the search space for gene family\nhistories accounting for gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene\ntransfer (the DLT-model). We introduce the notion of evolutionary histories\ndefined as a binary ordered rooted tree describing the evolution of a gene\nfamily, constrained by a species tree in the DLT-model. We provide formal\ngrammars describing the set of all evolutionary histories that are compatible\nwith a given species tree, whether it is ranked or unranked. These grammars\nallow us, using either analytic combinatorics or dynamic programming, to\nefficiently compute the number of histories of a given size, and also to\ngenerate random histories of a given size under the uniform distribution. We\napply these tools to obtain exact asymptotics for the number of gene family\nhistories for two species trees, the rooted caterpillar and the complete binary\ntree, as well as estimates of the range of the exponential growth factor of the\nnumber of histories for random species trees of size up to 25. Our results show\nthat including horizontal gene transfer induce a dramatic increase of the\nnumber of evolutionary histories. We also show that, within ranked species\ntrees, the number of evolutionary histories in the DLT-model is almost\nindependent of the species tree topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 11:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

The survey uses the high-band antennas of\nthe LOFAR Superterp, the dense inner part of the LOFAR core, to survey the\nnorthern sky (dec > 0 deg) at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz. A total\nof 219 tied-array beams (coherent summation of station signals, covering 12\nsquare degrees), as well as three incoherent beams (covering 67 square degrees)\nare formed in each survey pointing. For each ofthe 222 beams, total intensity\nis recorded at 491.52 us time resolution. Each observation integrates for 1 hr\nand covers 2592 channels from 119 to 151 MHz. This instrumental setup allows\nLOTAAS to reach a detection threshold of 1 to 5 mJy for periodic emission. Thus\nfar, the LOTAAS survey has resulted in the discovery of 73 radio pulsars. Among\nthese are two mildly recycled binary millisecond pulsars (P = 13 and 33 ms), as\nwell as the slowest-spinning radio pulsar currently known (P = 23.5 s). The\nsurvey has thus far detected 311 known pulsars, with spin periods ranging from\n4 ms to 5.0 s and dispersion measures from 3.0 to 217 pc/cc. Known pulsars are\ndetected at flux densities consistent with literature values. We find that the\nLOTAAS pulsar discoveries have, on average, longer spin periods than the known\npulsar population. This may reflect different selection biases between LOTAAS\nand previous surveys, though it is also possible that slower-spinning pulsars\npreferentially have steeper radio spectra. LOTAAS is the deepest all-sky pulsar\nsurvey using a digital aperture array; we discuss some of the lessons learned\nthat can inform the approach for similar surveys using future radio telescopes\nsuch as the Square Kilometre Array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 11:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Since halo states are formed by resonant $s$-wave\ninteractions, their properties exhibit universal correlations that are fairly\nindependent of the interactions at short distances. For diatomic molecules,\nthese properties depend on a single parameter only, and so this `universality'\nmeans that all the characteristics of a diatomic halo state can be determined\nwith high precision if only one parameter is accurately known. Furthermore,\nthis knowledge can be used to establish the respective property mass\nsensitivities for investigating the stability of $\\beta$.

The strong crystalline field combined with\nultra relativistic electrons is one of very few cases where the Schwinger field\ncan be experimentally achieved in the electron's rest frame. The radiation\nbeing emitted, the so-called channeling radiation, is a well studied\nphenomenon. However only the first order diagram corresponding to emission of a\nsingle photon has been studied so far. We elaborate on how the 2 photon\nemission process should be understood in terms of a two-step versus a one-step\nprocess, i.e., if one can consider one photon being emitted after the other, or\nif there is also a contribution where the two photons are emitted\n'simultaneously'. From the calculated full probability we see that the two-step\ncontribution is simply the product of probabilities for single photon emission\nwhile the additional one-step terms are, mainly, interferences due to several\npossible intermediate virtual states. These terms can contribute significantly\nwhen the crystal is thin. Therefore, in addition, we see how one can, for a\nthick crystal, calculate multiple photon emissions quickly by neglecting the\none-step terms, which represents a solution of the problem of quantum radiation\nreaction in a crystal beyond the usually applied constant field approximation.\nWe explicitly calculate an example of 180 GeV electrons in a thin Silicon\ncrystal and argue why it is, for experimental reasons, more feasible to see the\none-step contribution in a crystal experiment than in a laser experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 13:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

It is the main subroutine behind the\nbest algorithms for many dynamic problems whose complexity is not yet\nwell-understood, such as maintaining the largest eigenvalue, rank and\ndeterminant of a matrix and maintaining reachability, distances, maximum\nmatching size, and $k$-paths/cycles in a graph. Understanding the complexity of\ndynamic matrix inverse is a key to understand these problems.\n  In this paper, we present (i) improved algorithms for dynamic matrix inverse\nand their extensions to some incremental/look-ahead variants, and (ii) variants\nof the Online Matrix-Vector conjecture [Henzinger et al. STOC'15] that, if\ntrue, imply that these algorithms are tight. Our algorithms automatically lead\nto faster dynamic algorithms for the aforementioned problems, some of which are\nalso tight under our conjectures, e.g. reachability and maximum matching size\n(closing the gaps for these two problems was in fact asked by Abboud and V.\nWilliams [FOCS'14]). Prior best bounds for most of these problems date back to\nmore than a decade ago [Sankowski FOCS'04, COCOON'05, SODA'07; Kavitha\nFSTTCS'08; Mucha and Sankowski Algorithmica'10; Bosek et al. FOCS'14].\n  Our improvements stem mostly from the ability to use fast matrix\nmultiplication ``one more time'', to maintain a certain transformation matrix\nwhich could be maintained only combinatorially previously (i.e. without fast\nmatrix multiplication). Oddly, unlike other dynamic problems where this\napproach, once successful, could be repeated several times (``bootstrapping''),\nour conjectures imply that this is not the case for dynamic matrix inverse and\nsome related problems. However, when a small additional ``look-ahead''\ninformation is provided we can perform such repetition to drive the bounds down\nfurther.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 14:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

The field star sample used here contains 254 K and M stars\nwith temperatures derived using BT-Settl synthetic spectra. We use 106 stars\nwith precise temperatures in the literature to calibrate our method with\ntypical errors of about 140 K, and systematic uncertainties less than $\\sim$120\nK. For the broadest applicability, we present T$_{\\rm eff}$--line-depth-ratio\nrelationships, which we test on 12 members of the TW Hydrae Association and at\nspectral resolving powers between $\\sim$10,000--120,000. These ratios offer a\nsimple but accurate measure of effective temperature in cool stars that is\ndistance and reddening independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 15:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The implementation plan foresees, as a first step, an Electroweak\nFactory electron-positron collider. This high luminosity facility, operating\nbetween 90 and 365 GeV centre-of-mass energy, will study the heavy particles of\nthe Standard Model, Z, W, Higgs, and top with unprecedented accuracy. The\nElectroweak Factory $e^+e^-$ collider constitutes a real challenge to the\ntheory and to precision calculations, triggering the need for the development\nof new mathematical methods and software tools. A first workshop in 2018 had\nfocused on the first FCC-ee stage, the Tera-Z, and confronted the theoretical\nstatus of precision Standard Model calculations on the Z-boson resonance to the\nexperimental demands. The second workshop in January 2019, which is reported\nhere, extended the scope to the next stages, with the production of W-bosons\n(FCC-ee-W), the Higgs boson (FCC-ee-H) and top quarks (FCC-ee-tt). In\nparticular, the theoretical precision in the determination of the crucial input\nparameters, alpha_QED, alpha_QCD, M_W, m_t at the level of FCC-ee requirements\nis thoroughly discussed. The requirements on Standard Model theory calculations\nwere spelled out, so as to meet the demanding accuracy of the FCC-ee\nexperimental potential. The discussion of innovative methods and tools for\nmulti-loop calculations was deepened. Furthermore, phenomenological analyses\nbeyond the Standard Model were discussed, in particular the effective theory\napproaches.

For real photos, there are numerous labeled datasets for face\nparsing. Thus, we formulate caricature face parsing as a domain adaptation\nproblem, where real photos play the role of the source domain, adapting to the\ntarget caricatures.

In this article we try to take some further steps on this road. In\nparticular, we pay attention to a number of \\textit{prima facie} implausible\nand counter-intuitive aspects of realist interpretations of unitary quantum\nmechanics.

Theory shows these optimization methods can converge by using an\nunbiased gradient estimator. However, in practice biased gradient estimation\ncan allow more efficient convergence to the vicinity since an unbiased approach\nis computationally more expensive. To produce fast convergence there are two\ntrade-offs of these optimization strategies which are between stochastic/batch,\nand between biased/unbiased. This paper proposes an integrated approach which\ncan control the nature of the stochastic element in the optimizer and can\nbalance the trade-off of estimator between the biased and unbiased by using a\nhyper-parameter.

In this paper, by leveraging the dual nature\nof the two tasks, we propose an almost unsupervised learning method that only\nleverages few hundreds of paired data and extra unpaired data for TTS and ASR.\nOur method consists of the following components: (1) a denoising auto-encoder,\nwhich reconstructs speech and text sequences respectively to develop the\ncapability of language modeling both in speech and text domain; (2) dual\ntransformation, where the TTS model transforms the text $y$ into speech\n$\\hat{x}$, and the ASR model leverages the transformed pair $(\\hat{x},y)$ for\ntraining, and vice versa, to boost the accuracy of the two tasks; (3)\nbidirectional sequence modeling, which addresses error propagation especially\nin the long speech and text sequence when training with few paired data; (4) a\nunified model structure, which combines all the above components for TTS and\nASR based on Transformer model.
