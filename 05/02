One is that none of the link functions available in the\npopular packages is a good fit for the data. Second, it is computationally\ninefficient and impractical to test all the possible distributions to find the\noptimum one. In addition, many GLMs and their machine learning extensions\nstruggle on problems of overdispersion in Tweedie distributions. In this paper\nwe propose a quantum extension to GLM that overcomes these drawbacks. A quantum\ngate with non-Gaussian transformation can be used to continuously deform the\noutcome distribution from known results. In doing so, we eliminate the need for\na link function. Further, by using an algorithm that superposes all possible\ndistributions to collapse to fit a dataset, we optimize the model in a\ncomputationally efficient way. We provide an initial proof-of-concept by\ntesting this approach on both a simulation of overdispersed data and then on a\nbenchmark dataset, which is quite overdispersed, and achieved state of the art\nresults.

The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as\nconsisting of $c=O(1)$ characters, e.g., a 64-bit key as $c=8$ characters of\n8-bits. The character domain $\\Sigma$ should be small enough that character\ntables of size $|\\Sigma|$ fit in fast cache.

As a generic model for such an engine, we consider systems\nthat contain one or several active components and a single passive one that is\nasymmetric in its geometrical shape or its interactions. Generally, one expects\nthat such an asymmetry leads to a persistent, directed current in the passive\ncomponent, which can be used for the extraction of work. We validate this\nexpectation for a minimal model consisting of an active and a passive particle\non a one-dimensional lattice. It leads us to identify thermodynamically\nconsistent measures for the efficiency of the conversion of isotropic activity\nto directed work. For systems with continuous degrees of freedom, work cannot\nbe extracted using a one-dimensional geometry under quite general conditions.\nIn contrast, we put forward two-dimensional shapes of a movable passive\nobstacle that are best suited for the extraction of work, which we compare with\nanalytical results for an idealised work-extraction mechanism. For a setting\nwith many noninteracting active particles, we use a mean-field approach to\ncalculate the power and the efficiency, which we validate by simulations.\nSurprisingly, this approach reveals that the interaction with the passive\nobstacle can mediate cooperativity between otherwise noninteracting active\nparticles, which enhances the extracted power per active particle\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 16:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 13:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) measures the optical reflectance spectrum\nof the tissue and uses this information to quantify its composition, including\nStO2. However, real-time monitoring is difficult due to the capture rate and\ndata processing time. Methods: An endoscopic system based on a multi-fiber\nprobe was previously developed to sparsely capture HSI data (sHSI). These were\ncombined with RGB images, via a deep neural network, to generate\nhigh-resolution hypercubes and calculate StO2. To improve accuracy and\nprocessing speed, we propose a dual-input conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork (cGAN), Dual2StO2, to directly estimate StO2 by fusing features from\nboth RGB and sHSI. Results: Validation experiments were carried out on in vivo\nporcine bowel data, where the ground truth StO2 was generated from the HSI\ncamera. The performance was also compared to our previous\nsuper-spectral-resolution network, SSRNet in terms of mean StO2 prediction\naccuracy and structural similarity metrics. Dual2StO2 was also tested using\nsimulated probe data with varying fiber number. Conclusions: StO2 estimation by\nDual2StO2 is visually closer to ground truth in general structure, achieves\nhigher prediction accuracy and faster processing speed than SSRNet. Simulations\nshowed that results improved when a greater number of fibers are used in the\nprobe. Future work will include refinement of the network architecture,\nhardware optimization based on simulation results, and evaluation of the\ntechnique in clinical applications beyond StO2 estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 17:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 21:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

The information\non the internal structure and composition of the stars is encoded in their\ntidal Love numbers, which leave an imprint in the waveform of the GW signal\nemitted from the binary during the late inspiral phase. We extended the theory\nof tidal deformations of compact objects by computing the spin-tidal\ncorrections that affect the dynamics and the GW emission of a binary system at\nthe leading post-Newtonian (PN) order and to linear order in the spin. These\ncorrections are divided into two classes: terms due to the coupling between the\nstandard tidal Love numbers and the spins of the objects, and terms depending\non the rotational tidal Love numbers. Both enter the GW phase at 6.5PN order.\nWe analysed the impact of the spin-tidal couplings by estimating the parameter\nbias induced on GW170817-like events, assuming second- and third-generation\nground based interferometers. If relatively high spinning ($\\chi \\gtrsim 0.1$)\nNS binaries exist in nature, these effects might be observed by the next\ngeneration of detectors.

Our results show\nthat few observations of coalescing binary NS by a network of advanced\ndetectors would allow us to put interesting constraints on the phenomenological\nparameters of a piecewise polytropic representation of the EoS, and to perform\na model selection among the realistic EoS proposed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 17:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

The role of magnetic fields during the formation of high-mass stars\nis not yet fully understood, and the processes related to the early\nfragmentation and collapse are largely unexplored today. The high-mass star\nforming region G9.62+0.19 is a well known source, presenting several cores at\ndifferent evolutionary stages. Aims. We determine the magnetic field morphology\nand strength in the high-mass star forming region G9.62+0.19, to investigate\nits relation to the evolutionary sequence of the cores. Methods. We use Band 7\nALMA observations in full polarisation mode and we analyse the polarised dust\nemission. We estimate the magnetic field strength via the\nDavis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi and the Structure Function methods. Results. We\nresolve several protostellar cores embedded in a bright and dusty filamentary\nstructure. The polarised emission is clearly detected in six regions. Moreover\nthe magnetic field is oriented along the filament and appears perpendicular to\nthe direction of the outflows. We suggest an evolutionary sequence of the\nmagnetic field, and the less evolved hot core exhibits a magnetic field\nstronger than the more evolved one. We detect linear polarisation from thermal\nline emission and we tentatively compared linear polarisation vectors from our\nobservations with previous linearly polarised OH masers observations. We also\ncompute the spectral index, the column density and the mass for some of the\ncores. Conclusions. The high magnetic field strength and the smooth polarised\nemission indicate that the magnetic field could play an important role for the\nfragmentation and the collapse process in the star forming region G9.62+019 and\nthat the evolution of the cores can be magnetically regulated. On average, the\nmagnetic field derived by the linear polarised emission from dust, thermal\nlines and masers is pointing in the same direction and has consistent strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 10:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

In this paper, we present Trend Feature Symbolic Aggregate\napproximation (TFSAX) to solve this problem. First, we utilize Piecewise\nAggregate Approximation (PAA) approach to reduce dimensionality and discretize\nthe mean value of each segment by SAX. Second, extract trend feature in each\nsegment by using trend distance factor and trend shape factor. Then, design\nmulti-resolution symbolic mapping rules to discretize trend information into\nsymbols. We also propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX\ndistance with a weighted trend distance.

We use these simulations to predict surface brightnesses in\nH-alpha, which we show to have a characteristic ring-shaped morphology for\nhaloes in a narrow mass range between 10^9.5 and 10^9.6 M_sun. We explore how\nthis emission depends on physical parameters such as the DM density profile and\nthe UVB spectrum. We predict the abundance of fluorescent haloes on the sky,\nand discuss possible strategies for their detection. We demonstrate how\ndetailed observations of fluorescent rings can be used to infer the properties\nof the haloes which host them, such as their density profiles and the\nmass-concentration relation, as well as to directly measure the UVB amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

Because they are freely streaming,\nneutrinos can penetrate the interior of voids more easily than cold dark matter\nor baryons, which makes their relative contribution to the mass budget in voids\nmuch higher than elsewhere in the Universe. In simulations it has recently been\nshown how various characteristics of voids in the matter distribution are\naffected by neutrinos, such as their abundance, density profiles, dynamics, and\nclustering properties. However, the tracers used to identify voids in\nobservations (e.g., galaxies or halos) are affected by neutrinos as well, and\nisolating the unique neutrino signatures inherent to voids becomes more\ndifficult. In this paper we make use of the DEMNUni suite of simulations to\ninvestigate the clustering bias of voids in Fourier space as a function of\ntheir core density and compensation. We find a clear dependence on the sum of\nneutrino masses that remains significant even for void statistics extracted\nfrom halos. In particular, we observe that the amplitude of the linear void\nbias increases with neutrino mass for voids defined in dark matter, whereas\nthis trend gets reversed and slightly attenuated when measuring the relative\nvoid-halo bias using voids identified in the halo distribution. Finally, we\nargue how the original behaviour can be restored when considering observations\nof the total matter distribution (e.g. via weak lensing), and comment on\nscale-dependent effects in the void bias that may provide additional\ninformation on neutrinos in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 18:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 12:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

However, it is unclear how much this improvement\npersists when realistic circuit level noise is taken into account. This is\nbecause implementations of gates which do not commute with the dominant error\nun-bias the noise channel. In particular, a native bias-preserving\ncontrolled-NOT (CX) gate, which is an essential ingredient of stabilizer codes,\nis not possible in strictly two-level systems. Here we overcome the challenge\nof implementing a bias-preserving CX gate by using stabilized cat qubits in\ndriven nonlinear oscillators. The physical noise channel of this qubit is\nbiased towards phase-flips, which increase linearly with the size of the cat,\nwhile bit-flips are exponentially suppressed with cat size. Remarkably, the\nerror channel of this native CX gate between two such cat qubits is also\ndominated by phase-flips, while bit-flips remain exponentially suppressed. This\nCX gate relies on the topological phase that arises from the rotation of the\ncat qubit in phase space. The availability of bias-preserving CX gates opens a\npath towards fault-tolerant codes tailored to biased-noise cat qubits with high\nthreshold and low overhead. As an example, we analyze a scheme for concatenated\nerror correction using cat qubits. We find that the availability of CX gates\nwith moderately sized cat qubits, having mean photon number <10, improves a\nrigorous lower bound on the fault-tolerance threshold by a factor of two and\ndecreases the overhead in logical Clifford operations by a factor of 5. We\nexpect these estimates to improve significantly with further optimization and\nwith direct use of other codes such as topological codes tailored to biased\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 18:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

By jointly optimizing\nCNN models, computing architectures, and hardware implementations, our\nfull-stack approach achieves unprecedented performance in the trade-off space\ncharacterized by inference latency, energy efficiency, hardware utilization and\ninference accuracy. As a validation vehicle, we have implemented a 170MHz FPGA\ninference chip achieving 2.28ms latency for the ImageNet benchmark. The\nachieved latency is among the lowest reported in the literature while achieving\ncomparable accuracy. However, our chip shines in that it has 9x higher energy\nefficiency compared to other implementations achieving comparable latency. A\nhighlight of our full-stack approach which attributes to the achieved high\nenergy efficiency is an efficient Selector-Accumulator (SAC) architecture for\nimplementing the multiplier-accumulator (MAC) operation present in any digital\nCNN hardware. For instance, compared to a FPGA implementation for a traditional\n8-bit MAC, SAC substantially reduces required hardware resources (4.85x fewer\nLook-up Tables) and power consumption (2.48x).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 19:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

For an quantitative assessment of the expected memory\nbandwidth savings we show performance results of a first implementation on\nGPUs. Finally, we suggest a PAW generation scheme adjusted to the analytically\ngiven projector functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 20:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

Intense TCs are rare and have\nsmall-scale structures, making it difficult to produce large ensembles of\nstorms at high resolution. Further, models often fail to capture the process of\nrapid intensification, which is a distinguishing feature of many intense TCs.\nUnderstanding rapid intensification is especially important in the context of\nglobal warming, which may increase the frequency of intense TCs. To better\nleverage computational resources for the study of rapid intensification, we\nintroduce an action minimization algorithm applied to the WRF and WRFPLUS\nmodels. Action minimization nudges the model into forming more intense TCs than\nit otherwise would; it does so via the maximum likelihood path in a stochastic\nformulation of the model, thereby allowing targeted study of intensification\nmechanisms.\n  We apply action minimization to simulations of Hurricanes Danny (2015) and\nFred (2009) at 6 km resolution to demonstrate that the algorithm consistently\nintensifies TCs via physically plausible pathways. We show an approximately\nten-fold computational savings using action minimization to study the tail of\nthe TC intensification distribution. Further, for Hurricanes Danny and Fred,\naction minimization produces perturbations that preferentially reduce low-level\nshear as compared to upper-level shear, at least above a threshold of\napproximately $4 \\mathrm{\\ m \\ s^{-1}}$. We also demonstrate that asymmetric,\ntime-dependent patterns of heating can cause significant TC intensification\nbeyond symmetric, azimuthally-averaged heating and find a regime of non-linear\nresponse to asymmetric heating that has not been extensively studied in\nprevious work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 21:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The\nfocus of this initial investigation is on a task planning setting where one\nagent (the speaker) directly communicates a \"plan sketch\" to another agent (the\nlistener) to achieve coordination. In contrast to prior work, we view language\nformation as a fundamental requirement for resolving miscoordination. This view\nenables us to \"compute\" a language from the ground up by mapping physical\nstates to symbols, thus reverse engineering the function of languages.\nLanguages that arise from this process are only approximately expressive of the\nactual plans, meaning that they specify abstractions over the plan space, which\nis not only theoretically appealing as it provides the desired flexibility to\nthe listener to choose its plan during execution, but also practically useful\nsince it both reduces the communication cost of the speaker and computational\ncost of the listener. We formulate this language construction problem and show\nthat it is NEXP-complete.

Its defining feature is that\nits crossover step involves all the members of the current generation,\nstochastically recombining them with a repurposed variant of the $k$-means++\nseeding algorithm. The recombination also uses a reweighting mechanism that\nrealizes a progressively sharper stochastic selection policy and ensures that\nthe population eventually coalesces into a single solution. We compare this\nscheme with state-of-the-art alternative, a more standard genetic algorithm\nwith deterministic pairwise-nearest-neighbor crossover and an elitist selection\npolicy, of which we also provide an augmented and efficient implementation.\nExtensive tests on large and challenging datasets (both synthetic and\nreal-word) show that for fixed population sizes recombinator-$k$-means is\ngenerally superior in terms of the optimization objective, at the cost of a\nmore expensive crossover step. When adjusting the population sizes of the two\nalgorithms to match their running times, we find that for short times the\n(augmented) pairwise-nearest-neighbor method is always superior, while at\nlonger times recombinator-$k$-means will match it and, on the most difficult\nexamples, take over. We conclude that the reweighted whole-population\nrecombination is more costly, but generally better at escaping local minima.\nMoreover, it is algorithmically simpler and more general (it could be applied\neven to $k$-medians or $k$-medoids, for example).

Multi-level constrained\nterminal sketches are generalizations in which terminal vertices require\ndifferent levels or grades of service and each terminal pair is connected with\nedges of at least the minimum required level of the two terminals.\n  This paper gives a flexible procedure for computing a broad class of\nmulti-level graph sketches, which encompasses multi-level graph spanners,\nSteiner trees, and $k$--connected subgraphs as a few special cases.

On the one hand, we give algorithms with sublinear\ncomplexity, for the appropriate notion of complexity in each of these models.\nOur algorithms color a graph $G$ using about $\\kappa(G)$ colors, where\n$\\kappa(G)$ is the degeneracy of $G$: this parameter is closely related to the\narboricity $\\alpha(G)$. As a function of $\\kappa(G)$ alone, our results are\nclose to best possible, since the optimal number of colors is $\\kappa(G)+1$.\n  On the other hand, we establish certain lower bounds indicating that\nsublinear algorithms probably cannot go much further. In particular, we prove\nthat any randomized coloring algorithm that uses $\\kappa(G)+1$ many colors,\nwould require $\\Omega(n^2)$ storage in the one pass streaming model, and\n$\\Omega(n^2)$ many queries in the general graph query model, where $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices in the graph. These lower bounds hold even when the value of\n$\\kappa(G)$ is known in advance; at the same time, our upper bounds do not\nrequire $\\kappa(G)$ to be given in advance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 03:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

Although probabilistic\nmatrix factorisation and linear/nonlinear latent factor models have enjoyed\ngreat success in modelling such data, many existing models may have inferior\nmodelling performance due to the insufficient capability of modelling\noverdispersion in count-valued data and model misspecification in general. In\nthis paper, we comprehensively study these issues and propose a variational\nautoencoder based framework that generates discrete data via negative-binomial\ndistribution. We also examine the model's ability to capture properties, such\nas self- and cross-excitations in discrete data, which is critical for\nmodelling overdispersion.

The leading-order non-continuum versions of these representations are\nthen applied to the Landau gauge gluon propagator and ghost-gluon vertex of\nMonte Carlo simulations, to reveal two interesting insights. First, it is\ndemonstrated numerically and analytically that there exist special kinematic\nconfigurations where the basis descriptions of both functions reduce to their\ncontinuum analogues. Second, for the gluon two-point correlator it is shown\nthat the rate at which the function approaches its continuum form in the\ninfrared is independent of the lattice gauge coupling $\\beta$ (when working in\nlattice units): the said rate depends on kinematics alone and is ultimately\ndictated by the numerical gauge-fixing procedure.

We begin to answer this question for\nepithelial monolayers with a combination of theory via a vertex model and\nexperiments on keratinocyte monolayers. Vertex models are distinct from\nparticle models in that the interactions between the cells are shape-based, as\nopposed to distance-dependent. We investigate whether a disparity in cell shape\nor size alone is sufficient to drive demixing in bidisperse vertex model fluid\nmixtures.

On the other hand, shape disparity\ngenerates slight demixing over a few cell diameters, a phenomenon we term\nmicro-demixing. This result can be understood by examining the differential\nenergy barriers for neighbor exchanges (T1 transitions). Experiments with\nmixtures of wild-type and E-cadherin-deficient keratinocytes on a substrate are\nconsistent with the predicted phenomenon of micro-demixing, which biology may\nexploit to create subtle patterning.

Up to now\nthe mapping of these phases out of 21 cm emission hyper-spectral cubes has\nremained elusive mostly due to the velocity blending of individual cold\nstructures present on a given line of sight.\n  To address this problem, we developed a new Gaussian decomposition algorithm\nnamed ROHSA (Regularized Optimization for Hyper-Spectral Analysis) based on a\nmulti-resolution process from coarse to fine grid.

In this study, we\napplied SWE in the abdominal aortas of rats while increasing blood pressure\n(BP) to investigate the dependence of shear wave speed with invasive arterial\npressure and non-invasive arterial diameter measurements. A 15MHz linear array\nconnected to an ultrafast ultrasonic scanner, set non-invasively, on the\nabdominal aorta of anesthetized rats (N=5) was used. The SWE acquisition\nfollowed by an ultrafast (UF) acquisition was repeated at different moment of\nthe cardiac cycle to assess shear wave speed and arterial diameter variations\nrespectively. Invasive arterial BP catheter placed in the carotid, allowed the\naccurate measurement of pressure responses to increasing does of phenylephrine\ninfused via a venous catheter. The SWE acquisition coupled to the UF\nacquisition was repeated for different range of pressure. For normal range of\nBP, the shear wave speed was found to follow the aortic BP variation during a\ncardiac cycle. A minimum of (5.06$\\pm$0.82) m/s during diastole and a maximum\nof (5.97$\\pm$0.90) m/s during systole was measured.

A\nnon-linear relationship between shear wave speed and arterial BP was found. A\ncomplete non-invasive method was proposed to characterize the artery with shear\nwave speed combined with arterial diameter variations. Finally, the results\nwere validated against two parameters the incremental elastic modulus and the\npressure elastic modulus derived from BP and arterial diameter variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 11:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

These properties are similar to what is observed\nin early-type main-sequence stars, where the X-ray emission is attributed to\nturbulence and shocks in the stellar wind. Therefore, the same phenomenon could\nexplain the X-ray properties of Feige 34. However, it is not possible to\nreproduce the observed spectrum with a thermal-plasma model if the elemental\nabundances are fixed at the values obtained from the optical and UV\nspectroscopy. Moreover, we show that the X-ray luminosity and spectrum are\nconsistent with those expected from a young main-sequence star of late spectral\ntype. Therefore, we discuss the possibility that the observed X-ray emission is\ndue to the companion star of M0 spectral type, whose presence is suggested by\nthe IR excess in the spectral energy distribution of Feige 34.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 11:56:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 10:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

The skyline consists of all\npoints that are not dominated by any other points. It is a candidate set of the\noptimal solution, which depends on a specific evaluation criterion for optimum.\nHowever, conventional skyline queries, which return individual points, are\ninadequate in group querying case since optimal combinations are required. To\naddress this gap, we study the skyline computation in the group level and\npropose efficient methods to find the Group-based skyline (G-skyline). For\ncomputing the front $l$ skyline layers, we lay out an efficient approach that\ndoes the search concurrently on each dimension and investigates each point in\nthe subspace. After that, we present a novel structure to construct the\nG-skyline with a queue of combinations of the first-layer points. We further\ndemonstrate that the G-skyline is a complete candidate set of top-$l$\nsolutions, which is the main superiority over previous group-based skyline\ndefinitions. However, as G-skyline is complete, it contains a large number of\ngroups which can make it impractical.

The slope of the polarization spectrum was\ninvestigated by defining the quantity R_DC = p_D/p_C, where p_C and p_D\nrepresent polarization degrees in bands C and D, respectively.

It contains a chiral multiplet charged under a gauged\nR-symmetry which is restored at the maximum of the scalar potential with a\nplateau where inflation takes place. The effective field theory relies on two\nphenomenological parameters corresponding to corrections to the K\\\"ahler\npotential up to second order around the origin. The first guarantees the\nmaximum at the origin and the second allows the tuning of the vacuum energy\nbetween the F- and D-term contributions.

Customers arrive to the system\naccording to a stochastic process and upon arrival decide whether or not to\npurchase the service, depending on their willingness-to-pay and the current\nprice. The service time during which the resource is used by the customer is\nstochastic and the firm may incur a service cost. This model represents various\nmarkets for reusable resources such as cloud computing, shared vehicles,\nrotable parts, and hotel rooms. In the present paper, we analyze this pricing\nproblem when the firm attempts to maximize a weighted combination of three\ncentral metrics: profit, market share, and service level. Under Poisson\narrivals, exponential service times, and standard assumptions on the\nwillingness-to-pay distribution, we establish a series of results that\ncharacterize the performance of static pricing in such environments.\n  In particular, while an optimal policy is fully dynamic in such a context, we\nprove that a static pricing policy simultaneously guarantees 78.9% of the\nprofit, market share, and service level from the optimal policy. Notably, this\nresult holds for any service rate and number of units the firm operates. Our\nproof technique relies on a judicious construction of a static price that is\nderived directly from the optimal dynamic pricing policy. In the special case\nwhere there are two units and the induced demand is linear, we also prove that\nthe static policy guarantees 95.5% of the profit from the optimal policy. Our\nnumerical findings on a large testbed of instances suggest that the latter\nresult is quite indicative of the profit obtained by the static pricing policy\nacross all parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 13:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 22:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 03:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

In this paper we address the challenge of egocentric human action\nrecognition by utilizing the presence and position of detected regions of\ninterest in the scene explicitly, without further use of visual features.\n  Initially, we recognize that human hands are essential in the execution of\nactions and focus on obtaining their movements as the principal cues that\ndefine actions. We employ object detection and region tracking techniques to\nlocate hands and capture their movements. Prior knowledge about egocentric\nviews facilitates hand identification between left and right. With regard to\ndetection and tracking, we contribute a pipeline that successfully operates on\nunseen egocentric videos to find the camera wearer's hands and associate them\nthrough time. Moreover, we emphasize on the value of scene information for\naction recognition. We acknowledge that the presence of objects is significant\nfor the execution of actions by humans and in general for the description of a\nscene.

We first discuss the THSR wave function as a wave function of\ncluster-gas state, since the THSR wave function was originally introduced to\nelucidate the 3$\\alpha$-condensate-like character of the Hoyle state ($0_2^+$\nstate) of $^{12}$C. We briefly review the cluster-model studies of the Hoyle\nstate in 1970's in order to explain how there emerged the idea to assign the\n$\\alpha$ condensate character to the Hoyle state. We then explain that the THSR\nwave function can describe very well also non-gaslike ordinary cluster states\nwith spatial localization of clusters. This fact means that the dynamical\nmotion of clusters is of nonlocalized nature just as in gas-like states of\nclusters and the localization of clusters is due to the inter-cluster Pauli\nprinciple which is against the close approach of two clusters. The nonlocalized\ncluster dynamics is formulated by the container model of cluster dynamics. The\ncontainer model describes gas-like state and non-gaslike states as the\nsolutions of the Hill-Wheeler equation with respect to the size parameter of\nTHSR wave function which is just the size parameter of the container. When we\nnotice that fact that the THSR wave function with the smallest value of size\nparameter is equivalent to the shell-model wave function, we see that the\ncontainer model describes the evolution of cluster structure from the ground\nstate with shell-model structure up to the gas-like cluster state via ordinary\nnon-gaslike cluster states. For the description of various cluster structure,\nmore generation of THSR wave function have been introduced and we review some\ntypical examples with their actual applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 14:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

We present 2-approximation algorithms\nfor this problem with respect to unit squares and unit disks. Our algorithms\nrun in polynomial time when the optimum objective value is bounded by a\nconstant.\n  Motivated by channel-assignment in wireless networks, we consider a variant\nof the problem where the selected unit disks must be 3-colorable, i.e., colored\nby three colors such that all disks of the same color are pairwise disjoint.

To address these\ngaps, we introduce the spectral features extracted from two hypergraph\nstructures of the purchase records. Spectral features describe the\n\\textit{similarity} of users/items in the graph space, which is critical for\nrecommendation. We leverage spectral features to model the users' preference\nand items' properties by incorporating them into a Matrix Factorization (MF)\nmodel. In addition to modeling, we also use spectral features to optimize.\nBayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is extensively leveraged to optimize models\nin implicit feedback data. However, in BPR, all missing values are regarded as\nnegative samples equally while many of them are indeed unseen positive ones. We\nenrich the positive samples by calculating the similarity among users/items by\nthe spectral features. The key ideas are: (1) similar users shall have similar\npreference on the same item; (2) a user shall have similar perception on\nsimilar items. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the\nusefulness of the spectral features and the effectiveness of our\nspectrum-enhanced pairwise optimization. Our models outperform several\nstate-of-the-art models significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 15:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

However, this assumption may be too restrictive, e.g. in the\npresence of outliers as commonly encountered in many real-life applications. A\nnatural extension is to robustify the joint models by assuming more flexible\ndistributions than Gaussian for the random-effects and/or error terms.

Tidal\nsignatures in the GW arise from the response of a matter object to the\nspacetime curvature sourced by its binary companion. They crucially depend on\nthe EoS and are predominantly characterised by the tidal deformability\nparameters $\\Lambda_{\\ell}$, where $\\ell=2,3$ denotes the quadrupole and\noctupole respectively.

Additionally, pairing trajectory data with features such as defender\nheight, distance, and contest angle, we are able to evaluate not just perimeter\ndefenders, but also shooters' resilience to defensive pressure. Utilizing shot\ntrajectories and corresponding modeled shot-make probabilities, we are able to\ncreate perimeter defensive metrics that are more accurate and less variable\nthan traditional metrics like opponent field goal percentage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 15:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

The model focuses on the influence of human, social, physical and\ntemporal factors on successful evacuation. Human factors considered include\nperception and mobility defined by age. Social factors are defined by\nattachment bonds, social groups, population distribution, and cultural norms.\nPhysical factors refer to the location of the epicentre of the earthquake,\nspatial distribution/layout and attributes of environmental objects such as\nbuildings, roads, barriers (cars), placement of safe areas, evacuation routes,\nand the resulting debris/damage from the earthquake.

It has nothing to do with existence or\nnonexistence of dark energy and therefore for explaining cosmological\nacceleration dark energy is not needed. The result is obtained without using\nthe notion of dS background space (in particular, its metric and connection)\nbut simply as a consequence of quantum mechanics based on the dS Lie algebra.\nTherefore, $\\Lambda$ has a physical meaning only on classical level and the\ncosmological constant problem and the dark energy problem do not arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 04:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 06:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 03:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 03:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Since SAW devices are more and more\nused as sensor for a large variety of area: gas, pressure, force, temperature,\nstrain, radiation, etc. The sensors based SAW present the advantage to be\npassive (batteryless) and/or wireless. These interesting properties combined\nwith a small size, a low cost radio request system and a small antennas when\noperating at high frequency, offer new and exiting perspectives for wireless\nmeasurement processes and IDTAG applications. When the materials constituting\nthe devices are properly selected, it becomes possible to use those sensors\nwithout embedded electronic in hostile environments (as high temperature,\nnuclear site, ...) where no solutions are currently used. General principle of\nthe SAW sensor in wired and wireless configurations will be developed and a\nreview of recent works concerning the field of high temperature applications\nwill be presented with specific attention given to the choice of materials\nconstituting the SAW device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 12:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

The latter would require\nthe use of a piezoelectric substrate providing a large electromechanical\ncoupling coefficient K 2 , while being stable at high temperature. In this\nletter, we investigate the potentiality of stoichiometric lithium niobate (sLN)\ncrystals for such purpose.

In situ measurements of sLN-based SAW resonators conducted up to\n600$^\\circ$C show that the K 2 of these crystals remains high and stable\nthroughout the whole experiment, which is very promising for the future\nachievement of identifiable wireless high-temperature SAW sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 12:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Unlike other reported\ndevices with similar functionalities, our arrangement does not necessitate any\ninput mechanical energy or complex topographical structures to be embedded in\nthe substrate.
