However, in some cases, these\nmodels might be restrictive on the possible solutions or their solutions might\nbe difficult to interpret. To overcome this problem, we outline a new approach,\nthe so-called allagmatic method, that automatically programs and executes\nmodels with as little limitations as possible while maintaining human\ninterpretability. Earlier we described a metamodel and its building blocks\naccording to the philosophical concepts of structure (spatial dimension) and\noperation (temporal dimension). They are entity, milieu, and update function\nthat together abstractly describe cellular automata, artificial neural\nnetworks, and possibly any kind of computer model. By automatically combining\nthese building blocks in an evolutionary computation, interpretability might be\nincreased by the relationship to the metamodel, and models might be translated\ninto more interpretable models via the metamodel. We propose generic and\nobject-oriented programming to implement the entities and their milieus as\ndynamic and generic arrays and the update function as a method. We show two\nexperiments where a simple cellular automaton and an artificial neural network\nare automatically programmed, compiled, and executed. A target state is\nsuccessfully evolved and learned in the cellular automaton and artificial\nneural network, respectively. We conclude that the allagmatic method can create\nand execute cellular automaton and artificial neural network models in an\nautomated manner with the guidance of philosophy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 16:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 14:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 10:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 08:47:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 21:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 21:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

As an alternative to extracting the decay rate from the\nimaginary part of the ground-state energy of the false vacuum, we use the\noptical theorem in order to derive it from the real-time amplitude for forward\nscattering.

In this work, we propose a novel\nframework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an\ninterpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The\ninterpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where\nthe black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low\ncost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that\nconsiders predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency\n(defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.)\nUnder this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with\nassociation rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized\ntraining algorithms for both models.

Existing evaluation metrics primarily measure the\ndissimilarity between real and generated images using automated statistical\nmethods. They often require large sample sizes for evaluation and do not\ndirectly reflect human perception of image quality. In this work, we describe\nan evaluation metric we call Neuroscore, for evaluating the performance of\nGANs, that more directly reflects psychoperceptual image quality through the\nutilization of brain signals. Our results show that Neuroscore has superior\nperformance to the current evaluation metrics in that: (1) It is more\nconsistent with human judgment; (2) The evaluation process needs much smaller\nnumbers of samples; and (3) It is able to rank the quality of images on a per\nGAN basis.

At the initial stage, the images are classified into the two\ncategories of normal and abnormal. Since the Deep Neural Networks have\nperformed successfully in machine vision task, we would employ the\nconvolutional neural networks for the classification of images. In the second\nstage, the suggested framework is to diagnose and segment the tumor in the\nmammography images. First, the mammography images are pre-processed by removing\nnoise and artifacts, and then, segment the image using the level-set algorithm\nbased on the spatial fuzzy c-means clustering. The proper initialization and\noptimal configuration have strong effects on the performance of the level-set\nsegmentation. Thus, in our suggested framework, we have improved the level-set\nalgorithm by utilizing the spatial fuzzy c-means clustering which ultimately\nresults in a more precise segmentation.

When graph size\nexceeds memory size, out-of-core graph processing is needed. For the widely\nused external memory graph processing systems, accessing storage becomes the\nbottleneck. We make the observation that nearly all graph algorithms have a\ndynamically varying number of active vertices that must be processed in each\niteration. However, existing graph processing frameworks, such as GraphChi,\nload the entire graph in each iteration even if a small fraction of the graph\nis active. This limitation is due to the structure of the data storage used by\nthese systems. In this work, we propose to use a compressed sparse row (CSR)\nbased graph storage that is more amenable for selectively loading only a few\nactive vertices in each iteration. But CSR based systems suffers from random\nupdate propagation to many target vertices. To solve this challenge, we propose\nto use a multi-log update mechanism that logs updates separately, rather than\ndirectly update the active edges in a graph. Our proposed multi-log system\nmaintains a separate log per each vertex interval. This separation enables us\nto efficiently process each vertex interval by just loading the corresponding\nlog. Further, while accessing SSD pages with fewer active vertex data, we\nreduce the read amplification due to the page granular accesses in SSD by\nlogging the active vertex data in the current iteration and efficiently reading\nthe log in the next iteration. Over the current state of the art out-of-core\ngraph processing framework, our PartitionedVC improves performance by up to\n$17.84\\times$, $1.19\\times$, $1.65\\times$, $1.38\\times$, $3.15\\times$, and\n$6.00\\times$ for the widely used bfs, pagerank, community detection, graph\ncoloring, maximal independent set, and random-walk applications, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 17:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

It has been suggested that neuroanatomy places\nlimits on this capacity through a map architecture that creates competition for\ncortical space. This suggestion has been supported by the finding that primary\nvisual (V1) gray matter volume (GMV) is positively associated with VSTM\ncapacity. However, evidence from neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that the\ndorsal visual stream more broadly is vulnerable and atypical volumes of other\nmap-containing regions may therefore play a role. For example, Turner syndrome\nis associated with concomitantly reduced volume of the right intraparietal\nsulcus (IPS) and deficits in VSTM. As posterior IPS regions (IPS0-2) contains\ntopographic maps, together this suggests that posterior IPS volumes may also\nassociate with VSTM. In this study, we assessed VSTM using two tasks, as well\nas a composite score, and used voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted magnetic\nresonance images to assess GMV in V1 and right IPS0-2 in 32 healthy young\nadults (16 female). For comparison with previous work, we also assessed\nassociations between VSTM and voxel-wise GMV on a whole-brain basis. We found\nthat total brain volume (TBV) significantly correlated with VSTM, and that\ncorrelations between VSTM and regional GMV were substantially reduced in\nstrength when controlling for TBV. In our whole-brain analysis, we found that\nVSTM was associated with GMV of clusters centered around the right putamen and\nleft Rolandic operculum, though only when TBV was not controlled for. Our\nresults suggest that VSTM ability is unlikely to be accounted for by the volume\nof an individual cortical region and may instead rely on distributed structural\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 17:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Since dimensionality grows exponentially with the\nnumber of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in\nhigh dimensions. An important family of quantum protocols that can take\nadvantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space are classification tasks. These\ninclude quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum information\nprocessing and certain decision problems. However, due to counter-intuitive\ngeometrical properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Furthermore, this\nleads to a trade-off between the security of the classification algorithm\nagainst adversarial attacks and quantum advantages we expect for\nhigh-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial\nattacks require extra resources that scale at least polynomially with the\nHilbert space dimension of the system, which can erase any significant quantum\nadvantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol.

Recently, for the\nfirst time, Tcvetkova et al. [Phys. Rev.

In this paper, we propose an alternative practical design of a\nmetasurface-based converter by separating the incident plane wave and the\nsurface wave in different half-spaces. It allows one to preserve the\npolarization of the incident wave and substitute the anisotropic metasurface by\nan omega-bianisotropic one. The problem is approached from two sides: By\ndirectly solving the corresponding boundary problem and by considering the\n``time-reversed'' scenario when a surface wave is converted into a nonuniform\nplane wave.

Probably, the second best means to learn about important physical\nproperties of solar system objects is through stellar occultations. By\ncombining occultation observations from several sites, size and shape can be\nderived with kilometric accuracy. Also, atmospheric properties can be derived\nif the body has an atmosphere. Furthermore, the technique can detect rings and\neven satellites (although rarely) around the main body. Except for the very\nspecial cases of Pluto and Charon, stellar occultations by Transneptunian\nObjects (TNOs) had never been observed until October 2009. This was because the\nephemeris of the TNOs have much larger uncertainties than their angular\ndiameters (typically of the order of ~10 milliarcsecond) and also because\nstellar catalogs were not accurate to the milliarcsecond level. Despite the\ndifficulties, at the time of this writing, 43 occultations by 22 different\nTrans-Neptunian Objects, and 17 occultations by 5 Centaurs have been detected\nthanks to the efforts of several teams. Due to the complications of accurately\npredicting and observing these events, most of the successes have been achieved\nthrough wide international collaboration, which is a key issue to succeed in\nobserving stellar occultations by TNOs. Multichord occultations are typically\ndetected at a rate of ~3 per year on average, whereas the majority of the\nobserved occultations are single-chord detections, which means that only one\nsite detects the occultation. In these cases, no tight constraints on size and\nshape can be derived from those observations alone. Here we review most of the\naspects involved in the complex process to successfully observe occultations,\nand present some of the lessons learned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 18:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

We consider the relatively less studied problem of\ndesigning a learning algorithm for this problem when the underlying demand\ndistribution is unknown. The goal is to bound regret of the algorithm when\ncompared to the best base-stock policy.

However, the relation\nbetween these different effects is unclear, and how they combine to dictate\nforce transmission range is still elusive. Here, we combine discrete fiber\nsimulations with continuum modeling to study the decay of displacements induced\nby a contractile cell in fibrous networks. We demonstrate that fiber\nnon-linearity and fiber reorientation both contribute to the strain-induced\nanisotropy of the elastic moduli of the cell local environment. This elastic\nanisotropy is a parameter that governs the slow decay of the displacements, and\nit depends on the magnitude of applied strain, either an external tension or an\ninternal contraction as a model of the cell. Furthermore, we show that\naccounting for artificially-prescribed elastic anisotropy dictates the\ndisplacement decay induced by a contracting cell. Our findings unify previous\nsingle effects into a mechanical theory that explains force transmission in\nfibrous networks.

Steady solar wind\nstreams modulate the propagation behaviour of interplanetary coronal mass\nejections and are themselves an important driver of recurrent geomagnetic storm\nactivity. The knowledge of the ambient solar wind flows and fields is thus an\nessential component of successful space weather forecasting. Here, we present\nan implementation of an operational framework for operating, validating and\noptimizing models of the ambient solar wind flow on the example of Carrington\nRotation 2077. We reconstruct the global topology of the coronal magnetic field\nusing the potential field source surface model (PFSS) and the Schatten current\nsheet model (SCS), and discuss three empirical relationships for specifying the\nsolar wind conditions near the Sun, namely the Wang-Sheeley (WS) model, the\ndistance from the coronal hole boundary (DCHB) model, and the Wang-Sheeley-Arge\n(WSA) model.

The\nposterior distribution may be explored by sampling methods, but for many\nproblems it is computationally infeasible to do so. In this situation maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) estimators are often sought. Whilst these are relatively cheap\nto compute, and have an attractive variational formulation, a key drawback is\ntheir lack of invariance under change of parameterization. This is a\nparticularly significant issue when hierarchical priors are employed to learn\nhyperparameters. In this paper we study the effect of the choice of\nparameterization on MAP estimators when a conditionally Gaussian hierarchical\nprior distribution is employed. Specifically we consider the centred\nparameterization, the natural parameterization in which the unknown state is\nsolved for directly, and the noncentred parameterization, which works with a\nwhitened Gaussian as the unknown state variable, and arises when considering\ndimension-robust MCMC algorithms; MAP estimation is well-defined in the\nnonparametric setting only for the noncentred parameterization. However, we\nshow that MAP estimates based on the noncentred parameterization are not\nconsistent as estimators of hyperparameters; conversely, we show that limits of\nfinite-dimensional centred MAP estimators are consistent as the dimension tends\nto infinity. We also consider empirical Bayesian hyperparameter estimation,\nshow consistency of these estimates, and demonstrate that they are more robust\nwith respect to noise than centred MAP estimates. An underpinning concept\nthroughout is that hyperparameters may only be recovered up to measure\nequivalence, a well-known phenomenon in the context of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 20:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

In order to mimic the\nheterogeneous composition of the mass of investors in a market, the agent-based\nmodel considers two different types of traders: noise traders and contrarians.\nAgents are represented as nodes in a network of interactions and they can\nassume any of three distinct possible states (e.g. buy, sell or remain\ninactive). The time evolution of the state of an agent is dictated by\nprobabilistic dynamics that include both local and global influences. A noise\ntrader is subject to local interactions, tending to assume the majority state\nof its nearest neighbors, whilst a contrarian is subject to a global\ninteraction with the behavior of the market as a whole, tending to assume the\nstate of the global minority of the market. The model exhibits the typical\nqualitative and quantitative features of real financial time series, including\ndistributions of returns with heavy tails, volatility clustering and long-time\nmemory for the absolute values of the returns. The distributions of returns are\nfitted by means of coupled Gaussian distributions, quantitatively revealing\ntransitions between leptokurtic, mesokurtic and platykurtic regimes in terms of\na non-linear statistical coupling which describes the complexity of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 20:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

(2017), this paper proposes two\nefficient methods for computing dynamic leakage, a compositional method along\nwith the sequential structure of a program and a parallel computation based on\nthe value domain decomposition. For the former, we also investigate both exact\nand approximated calculations. From the perspective of implementation, we\nutilize binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and deterministic decomposable negation\nnormal forms (d-DNNFs) to represent Boolean formulas in model counting.\nFinally, we show experimental results on several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 00:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Experimental results show that the\nproposed model fitting strategy can be incorporated into a model predictive\ncontroller to generate good exploration behaviors for learning acceleration,\nwhile preserving the benefits of model-free reinforcement learning for\nuncertain environments. In addition to the sample complexity, the inevitable\nrobot overloaded during operation also tends to limit the learning efficiency.\nTo address this problem, we present a method to restrict the largest possible\npotential energy in the compliance control system and therefore keep the\ncontact force within the legitimate range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 02:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Humans can flawlessly understand others' behaviour by combining\ndifferent visual cues from activity to gestures and facial expressions.\nEmpowering the computer vision systems to do so, however, is still an open\nproblem due to its intrinsic challenges as well as extrinsic enforced\ndifficulties like lack of publicly available data and unique environment\nconditions (wild).

To do so, we introduce a framework for integrating human pose\nand object motion to both temporally detect and classify the activities in a\nfine-grained manner (very short and similar activities). We incorporate partial\nhuman pose and interaction with the objects in a multi-stream neural network\narchitecture to guide the spatiotemporal attention mechanism for more efficient\nactivity recognition. To this end, in the absence of pose supervision, we\npropose to use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate exact joint\nlocations from noisy probability heat maps. Additionally, based on the\nintuition that complex actions demand more than one source of information to be\nidentified even by humans, we integrate the second stream of object motion to\nour network as a prior knowledge that we quantitatively show improves the\nrecognition results.

Consequently, there is a\ngrowing need for filter-level pruning approaches for compressing CNN based\nmodels that not only reduce the total number of parameters but reduce the\noverall computation as well. We present a new min-max framework for\nfilter-level pruning of CNNs. Our framework, called Play and Prune (PP),\njointly prunes and fine-tunes CNN model parameters, with an adaptive pruning\nrate, while maintaining the model's predictive performance. Our framework\nconsists of two modules: (1) An adaptive filter pruning (AFP) module, which\nminimizes the number of filters in the model; and (2) A pruning rate controller\n(PRC) module, which maximizes the accuracy during pruning. Moreover, unlike\nmost previous approaches, our approach allows directly specifying the desired\nerror tolerance instead of pruning level. Our compressed models can be deployed\nat run-time, without requiring any special libraries or hardware. Our approach\nreduces the number of parameters of VGG-16 by an impressive factor of 17.5X,\nand number of FLOPS by 6.43X, with no loss of accuracy, significantly\noutperforming other state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 04:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Its key challenge lies in the difficulty of balancing the\nlearning timeliness and model accuracy. To this end, most works follow a\nsupervised setting, i.e., using class labels to boost the hashing performance,\nwhich defects in two aspects: First, strong constraints, e.g., orthogonal or\nsimilarity preserving, are used, which however are typically relaxed and lead\nto large accuracy drop. Second, large amounts of training batches are required\nto learn the up-to-date hash functions, which largely increase the learning\ncomplexity. To handle the above challenges, a novel supervised online hashing\nscheme termed Hadamard Matrix Guided Online Hashing (HMOH) is proposed in this\npaper. Our key innovation lies in introducing Hadamard matrix, which is an\northogonal binary matrix built via Sylvester method. In particular, to release\nthe need of strong constraints, we regard each column of Hadamard matrix as the\ntarget code for each class label, which by nature satisfies several desired\nproperties of hashing codes. To accelerate the online training, LSH is first\nadopted to align the lengths of target code and to-be-learned binary code. We\nthen treat the learning of hash functions as a set of binary classification\nproblems to fit the assigned target code.

Depending on the couplings of the internal degrees of\nfreedom, relaxation can be ultrafast, converting electronic energy in a few fs,\nor slow, if the energy is trapped in a metastable state that decouples from its\nenvironment. Here, helium nanodroplets are resonantly excited by femtosecond\nextreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulses from a seeded free-electron laser. Despite\ntheir superfluid nature, we find that helium nanodroplets in the lowest\nelectronically excited states undergo ultrafast relaxation. By comparing\nexperimental photoelectron spectra with time-dependent density functional\ntheory simulations, we unravel the full relaxation pathway: Following an\nultrafast interband transition, a void nanometer-sized bubble forms around the\nlocalized excitation (He*) within 1 ps. Subsequently, the bubble collapses and\nreleases metastable He* at the droplet surface.

The variational inequality (VI) is\na static problem which is studied under dynamical settings using a framework\ncalled the projected dynamical system, whose stationary points coincide with\nthe static solutions of the associated VI. VI has rich properties concerning\nthe monotonicity of its vector-valued map and the uniqueness of its solution,\nwhich can be extended to convex optimization and saddle-point problems.\nMoreover, these properties also extend to the representative projected\ndynamical system. The objective of this paper is to harness rich monotonicity\nproperties of the representative projected dynamical system to develop the\nsolution concepts of the convex optimization problem and the associated\nsaddle-point problem. To this end, this paper studies a linear inequality\nconstrained convex optimization problem and models its equivalent saddle-point\nproblem as a VI. Further, the VI is studied as a projected dynamical\nsystem\\cite{friesz1994day} which is shown to converge to the saddle-point\nsolution. By considering the monotonicity of the gradient of Lagrangian\nfunction as a key factor, this paper establishes exponential convergence and\nstability results concerning the saddle-points. Our results show that the\ngradient of the Lagrangian function is just monotone on the Euclidean space,\nleading to only Lyapunov stability of stationary points of the projected\ndynamical system. To remedy the situation, the underlying projected dynamical\nsystem is formulated on a Riemannian manifold whose Riemannian metric is chosen\nsuch that the gradient of the Lagrangian function becomes strongly monotone.\nUsing a suitable Lyapunov function, the stationary points of the projected\ndynamical system are proved to be globally exponentially stable and convergent\nto the unique saddle-point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 13:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

This\nphenomenon, that we coin ``fast and furious\" learning in games, sets a new\nbenchmark about what is possible both in max-min optimization as well as in\nmulti-agent systems. Our analysis does not depend on introducing a carefully\ntailored dynamic. Instead we focus on the most well studied online dynamic,\ngradient descent. Similarly, we focus on the simplest textbook class of games,\ntwo-agent two-strategy zero-sum games, such as Matching Pennies. Even for this\nsimplest of benchmarks the best known bound for total regret, prior to our\nwork, was the trivial one of $O(T)$, which is immediately applicable even to a\nnon-learning agent. Based on a tight understanding of the geometry of the\nnon-equilibrating trajectories in the dual space we prove a regret bound of\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ matching the well known optimal bound for adaptive step\nsizes in the online setting. This guarantee holds for all fixed step-sizes\nwithout having to know the time horizon in advance and adapt the fixed\nstep-size accordingly. As a corollary, we establish that even with fixed\nlearning rates the time-average of mixed strategies, utilities converge to\ntheir exact Nash equilibrium values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 14:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Linear transfers can be seen as an extension of convex lower\nsemi-continuous energies on Wasserstein space, of cost minimizing mass\ntransports, as well as many other couplings between probability measures to\nwhich Monge-Kantorovich theory does not readily apply. Basic examples include\nbalayage of measures, martingale transports, optimal Skorokhod embeddings, and\nthe weak mass transports of Talagrand, Marton, Gozlan and others. The class\nalso includes various stochastic mass transports such as the Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge associated to a reversible Markov process, and the Arnold-Brenier\nvariational principle for the incompressible Euler equations. We associate to\nmost linear transfers, a critical constant, a corresponding effective linear\ntransfer and additive eigenfunctions to their dual Kantorovich operators, that\nextend Man\\'e's critical value, Aubry-Mather invariant tori, and Fathi's weak\nKAM solutions for Hamiltonian systems. This amounts to studying the asymptotic\nproperties of the nonlinear Kantorovich operators as opposed to classical\nergodic theory, which deals with linear Markov operators. This allows for the\nextension of Mather theory to other settings such as its stochastic\ncounterpart. We also introduce the class of convex transfers, which includes\n$p$-powers ($ p \\geq 1$) of linear transfers, the logarithmic entropy, the\nDonsker-Varadhan information, optimal mean field plans, and certain free\nenergies as functions of two probability measures, i.e., where the reference\nmeasure is also a variable.

Specifically, once the\nattackers obtain the deep model, they can construct adversarial examples to\nmislead the model to yield wrong classification results. Deployable adversarial\nexamples such as small stickers pasted on the road signs and lanes have been\nshown effective in misleading advanced driver-assistance systems. Many existing\ncountermeasures against adversarial examples build their security on the\nattackers' ignorance of the defense mechanisms. Thus, they fall short of\nfollowing Kerckhoffs's principle and can be subverted once the attackers know\nthe details of the defense. This paper applies the strategy of moving target\ndefense (MTD) to generate multiple new deep models after system deployment,\nthat will collaboratively detect and thwart adversarial examples. Our MTD\ndesign is based on the adversarial examples' minor transferability to models\ndiffering from the one (e.g., the factory-designed model) used for attack\nconstruction. The post-deployment quasi-secret deep models significantly\nincrease the bar for the attackers to construct effective adversarial examples.\nWe also apply the technique of serial data fusion with early stopping to reduce\nthe inference time by a factor of up to 5 while maintaining the sensing and\ndefense performance. Extensive evaluation based on three datasets including a\nroad sign image database and a GPU-equipped Jetson embedded computing board\nshows the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 08:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}
