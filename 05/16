This is especially\nrelevant for theories exhibiting Vainshtein screening, where such deviations\nare efficiently suppressed within a (typically large) Vainshtein radius.\nHowever, Vainshtein screening is known to be shape dependent: it is most\neffective around spherical sources, weaker around cylindrical objects and\ncompletely absent for planar sources. The Cosmic Web therefore offers a testing\nground, as it displays many shapes in the form of clusters, filaments and\nwalls.\n  In this work, we explicitly derive the signature of the shape dependence of\nVainshtein screening on the matter bispectrum, by considering a cubic Galileon\nmodel with a conformal coupling to matter and a cosmological constant. We\nperform a second order perturbative analysis, deriving analytic, integral\nexpressions for the bispectrum, which we integrate using hi_class. We find that\nthe shape dependence of Vainshtein screening enters the bispectrum with a\nunique scale-factor dependence of $\\propto a^{3/2}$. The magnitude of the\neffect today is up to 2 % for a model whose linear growth rate deviates up to 5\n% from $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 16:01:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 13:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel estimator for statistical inference on edge\nparameters in pairwise graphical models based on generalized Hyv\\\"arinen\nscoring rule. Hyv\\\"arinen scoring rule is especially useful in cases where the\nnormalizing constant cannot be obtained efficiently in a closed form, which is\na common problem for graphical models, including Ising models and truncated\nGaussian graphical models. Our estimator allows us to perform statistical\ninference for general graphical models whereas the existing works mostly focus\non statistical inference for Gaussian graphical models where finding\nnormalizing constant is computationally tractable. Under mild conditions that\nare typically assumed in the literature for consistent estimation, we prove\nthat our proposed estimator is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal,\nwhich allows us to construct confidence intervals and build hypothesis tests\nfor edge parameters. Moreover, we show how our proposed method can be applied\nto test hypotheses that involve a large number of model parameters\nsimultaneously.

Vickrey auctions have been known to\ndetermine the real market price of items as bidders are motivated to submit\ntheir own monetary valuations without leaking their information to the\ncompetitors. Recent constructions have utilized various cryptographic protocols\nsuch as ZKP and MPC, however, these approaches either are partially\nprivacy-preserving or require complex computations with several rounds. In this\npaper, we overcome these limits by presenting Trustee as a Vickrey auction on\nEthereum which fully preserves bids' privacy at relatively much lower fees.\nTrustee consists of three components: a front-end smart contract deployed on\nEthereum, an Intel SGX enclave, and a relay to redirect messages between them.\nInitially, the enclave generates an Ethereum account and ECDH key-pair.\nSubsequently, the relay publishes the account's address and ECDH public key on\nthe smart contract. As a prerequisite, bidders are encouraged to verify the\nauthenticity and security of Trustee by using the SGX remote attestation\nservice. To participate in the auction, bidders utilize the ECDH public key to\nencrypt their bids and submit them to the smart contract. Once the bidding\ninterval is closed, the relay retrieves the encrypted bids and feeds them to\nthe enclave that autonomously generates a signed transaction indicating the\nauction winner. Finally, the relay submits the transaction to the smart\ncontract which verifies the transaction's authenticity and the parameters'\nconsistency before accepting the claimed auction winner. As part of our\ncontributions, we have made a prototype for Trustee available on Github for the\ncommunity to review and inspect it. Additionally, we analyze the security\nfeatures of Trustee and report on the transactions' gas cost incurred on\nTrustee smart contract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 16:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

The weight of a perfect Italian function is\nthe sum of the weights of the vertices.

A recently developed fast, tunable genetic oscillator by Stricker et\nal.[23] has demonstrated robustness and tunability of oscillatory behavior by\ncombining positive and negative feedback loops. This oscillator combining lacI\n(negative) and araC (positive) feedback loops, was however modeled using\nmultiple layers of differential equations to capture the molecular complexity\nof regulation, in order to explain the experimentally measured oscillations.

We find the minimal period of the oscillator is sensitive to DNA\ncopy number asymmetry, but translation rate asymmetry has an identical effect\nas plasmid copy numbers, while modulating the asymmetry in mRNA degradation can\nimprove the tunability of period of the oscillator, together with increased\nrobustness to replication 'noise' and influence of the host cell cycle. Thus,\nour model predicts experimentally testable principles to redesign a potentially\nmore robust oscillatory genetic network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 17:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Those flaws occur\nwhen rising internal pressure pushes the mold open and cured polymer flows out\nthrough gaps at the parting lines. Known as backrind, such defects are\nparticularly common in compression molding, where the increasing pressure of a\ntrapped, incompressible polymer can overwhelm the clamping pressure on the mold\nand expel polymer from the mold pocket. If that ejected material has already\ncured, it leaves behind structural damage and consequently a flaw in the\nfinished product.\n  Backrind usually appears as a ragged seam line near the gap where cured\npolymer exited the mold. Its appearance is typically irregular and fragmented,\nsuggesting no particular pattern or uniformity to the process that produced it.\nIn such cases, the cured polymer acts predominantly as a viscoelastic solid as\nit is driven toward and through the parting line. The backrind's ragged\ncharacter results from tearing and fragmentation of that solid.\n  It is possible, however, for the cured polymer to act predominantly as a\nviscoelastic liquid as it flows toward and through the parting line. Since the\nReynolds number is low, the flow is laminar and the backrind bears witness to\nthat laminar flow. More specifically, the backrind's observed shaped\ncorresponds to isochronous contours in the laminar flow toward the parting\nline, contours that can be predicted using computational fluid dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 17:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

At the same time, random matrix theory has established a powerful\nframework for characterizing the onset of quantum chaos and ergodicity (or the\nabsence thereof) in quantum many-body systems.

Current approaches either downsample an\nultra-high resolution image or crop it into small patches for separate\nprocessing. In either way, the loss of local fine details or global contextual\ninformation results in limited segmentation accuracy. We propose collaborative\nGlobal-Local Networks (GLNet) to effectively preserve both global and local\ninformation in a highly memory-efficient manner. GLNet is composed of a global\nbranch and a local branch, taking the downsampled entire image and its cropped\nlocal patches as respective inputs. For segmentation, GLNet deeply fuses\nfeature maps from two branches, capturing both the high-resolution fine\nstructures from zoomed-in local patches and the contextual dependency from the\ndownsampled input. To further resolve the potential class imbalance problem\nbetween background and foreground regions, we present a coarse-to-fine variant\nof GLNet, also being memory-efficient. Extensive experiments and analyses have\nbeen performed on three real-world ultra-high aerial and medical image datasets\n(resolution up to 30 million pixels).

The optical\ndomain, in contrast, provides low delay interconnectivity suitable for such\nnode distributed non Von Neumann architectures relying on dense node to node\ncommunication. Thus, once the neural network's weights are set, the delay of\nthe network is just given by the time of flight of the photon, which is in the\npicosecond range for photonic integrated circuits.

A closed-loop simulation platform is\nneeded to probe and understand the intra-system (application data flow) and\ninter-system (system and environment) interactions in MAV applications to\npinpoint bottlenecks and identify opportunities for hardware and software\nco-design and optimization. In addition to the simulator, MAVBench provides a\nbenchmark suite, the first of its kind, consisting of a variety of MAV\napplications designed to enable computer architects to perform characterization\nand develop future aerial computing systems. Using our open source, end-to-end\nexperimental platform, we uncover a hidden, and thus far unexpected compute to\ntotal system energy relationship in MAVs. Furthermore, we explore the role of\ncompute by presenting three case studies targeting performance, energy and\nreliability. These studies confirm that an efficient system design can improve\nMAV's battery consumption by up to 1.8X.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 18:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 01:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

To this end, we propose a novel statistical construction of the\nfinite element method that provides the means of synthesising measurement data\nand finite element models. The Bayesian statistical framework is adopted to\ntreat all the uncertainties present in the data, the mathematical model and its\nfinite element discretisation. From the outset, we postulate a data-generating\nmodel which additively decomposes data into a finite element, a model\nmisspecification and a noise component. Each of the components may be uncertain\nand is considered as a random variable with a respective prior probability\ndensity. The prior of the finite element component is given by a conventional\nstochastic forward problem. The prior probabilities of the model\nmisspecification and measurement noise, without loss of generality, are assumed\nto have zero-mean and known covariance structure. Our proposed statistical\nmodel is hierarchical in the sense that each of the three random components may\ndepend on non-observable random hyperparameters. Because of the hierarchical\nstructure of the statistical model, Bayes rule is applied on three different\nlevels in turn to infer the posterior densities of the three random components\nand hyperparameters. On level one, we determine the posterior densities of the\nfinite element component and the true system response using the prior finite\nelement density given by the forward problem and the data likelihood. On the\nnext level, we infer the hyperparameter posterior densities from their\nrespective priors and the marginal likelihood of the first inference problem.\nFinally, on level three we use Bayes rule to choose the most suitable finite\nelement model in light of the observed data by computing the model posteriors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 12:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

In settings where only\nobservational data is available, Synthetic Control (SC) methods provide a\npopular data-driven approach to estimate a \"synthetic\" control by combining\nmeasurements of \"similar\" units (donors). Recently, Robust SC (RSC) was\nproposed as a generalization of SC to overcome the challenges of missing data\nhigh levels of noise, while removing the reliance on domain knowledge for\nselecting donors. However, SC, RSC, and their variants, suffer from poor\nestimation when the pre-intervention period is too short. As the main\ncontribution, we propose a generalization of unidimensional RSC to\nmulti-dimensional RSC, mRSC. Our proposed mechanism incorporates multiple\nmetrics to estimate a synthetic control, thus overcoming the challenge of poor\ninference from limited pre-intervention data. We show that the mRSC algorithm\nwith $K$ metrics leads to a consistent estimator of the synthetic control for\nthe target unit under any metric. Our finite-sample analysis suggests that the\nprediction error decays to zero at a rate faster than the RSC algorithm by a\nfactor of $K$ and $\\sqrt{K}$ for the training and testing periods (pre- and\npost-intervention), respectively.

Other authors have produced results about\nrank-2 universal cycles and 1-overlap cycles, which are equivalent to our\ndefinition of Euler tours. In contrast, an Euler family is a collection of\nnontrivial closed walks that jointly traverse every edge of the hypergraph\nexactly once and cannot be concatenated simply. Since an Euler tour is an Euler\nfamily comprising a single walk, having an Euler family is a weaker attribute\nthan being eulerian; we call a hypergraph quasi-eulerian if it admits an Euler\nfamily. A triple system is a 3-uniform hypergraph in which every pair of\nvertices lie in exactly $\\lambda$ edges together, for some parameter $\\lambda$.\nWe first prove that all triple systems with at least two edges are eulerian. We\nthen define a new kind of hypergraph, which we call $\\ell$-covering\n$k$-hypergraphs: these are $k$-uniform hypergraphs in which every $\\ell$-subset\nof the vertices lie in at least one edge together.

Indeed, flows, semiflows, and maps (both invertible and not) have\nbeen studied at length. A view that has proven particularly fruitful is\ntopological: consider invariant sets (attractors, repellers, periodic orbits,\netc.) as topological objects, and the connecting sets between them form\ngradient like flows. In the case of systems with uniqueness in forward time, an\nattractor in one system is related to nearby attractors in a family of other,\n\"close enough\" systems.\n  One way of seeing that connection is through the Conley decomposition (and\nthe Conley index) [2], [13]. This approach requires focusing on isolated\ninvariant sets - that is, invariant sets with isolating neighborhoods. If there\nis an invariant set $I$, which has an isolating neighborhood $N$ $\\ldots$.\n  This approach was expanded to discrete time systems which lack uniqueness in\nforward time, using relations, in [7] and [11]. Relations do not rely on\nuniqueness in forward time, but the graph of any map is a relation; thus they\nserve to generalize maps. Some of this is reviewed in the next few sections. In\naddition, I expanded on work done in [7] to show that in compact metric spaces,\nattractors for closed relations continue (see Section 6). On the continuous\ntime side, more work needs to be done. This paper is a step toward a more\nsystematic approach for continuous time systems which lack uniqueness in\nforward time.

Such metasurfaces are well suited to planar\nfabrication techniques and their synthesis is facilitated by modelling them as\nimpedance sheets separated by transmission lines. We show that this model can\nbe significantly inaccurate in some cases, due to near-field coupling between\nmetallic layers. This problem is particularly severe for higher frequency\ndesigns, where fabrication tolerances prevent the patterns from being\nhighly-subwavelength in size. Since the near-field coupling is difficult to\ndescribe analytically, correcting for it in a design typically requires\nnumerical optimization. We propose an extension of the widely used\nequivalent-circuit model to incorporate near-field coupling and show that the\nextended model can predict the scattering parameters of a metasurface\naccurately. Based on our extended model, we introduce an improved metasurface\nsynthesis algorithm that gives physical insight to the problem and efficiently\ncompensates for the perturbations induced by near-field coupling.

The concept of\narea occupancy is used to express the traffic pressure and equilibrium speed\nrelationship yielding a coupling between the two classes of vehicles. Each\nvehicle class is characterized by its own vehicle size and driver's behavior.\nThe considered equilibrium profiles of the model represent evenly distributed\ntraffic with constant densities and velocities of both classes along the\ninvestigated track section.

Conversely, Triple GAN\nconsists of a three-player game that tries to leverage good generated samples\nto boost classification results. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive\ncomparison of these two approaches on different benchmark datasets. We\ndemonstrate their different properties on image generation, and sensitivity to\nthe amount of labeled data provided. By comprehensively comparing these two\nmethods, we hope to shed light on the future of GAN-based semi-supervised\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 00:43:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 01:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

This is a natural extension of the\nwell-studied SetCover problem; though in the parameterized regime we know it to\nbe $W[1]$-complete in the exact case, its parameterized complexity with respect\nto approximability is not well understood.\n  We prove that, assuming ETH, for some $\\gamma > 0$ there is no time $f(k)\n\\cdot N^{\\gamma k}$ algorithm that can, given a $k$-ExactCover instance $I$,\ndistinguish between the case where $I$ has an exact cover of size $k$ and the\ncase where every set cover of $I$ has size at least $\\frac14\n\\sqrt[k]{\\frac{\\log N}{\\log \\log N}}$.

Most of the general face recognition\nalgorithms usually assume a sufficient resolution for the face images. However,\nin practice many applications often do not have sufficient image resolutions.\nThe modern face hallucination models demonstrate reasonable performance to\nreconstruct high-resolution images from its corresponding low resolution\nimages. However, they do not consider identity level information during\nhallucination which directly affects results of the recognition of low\nresolution faces. To address this issue, we propose a Face Hallucination\nGenerative Adversarial Network (FH-GAN) which improves the quality of low\nresolution face images and accurately recognize those low quality images.\nConcretely, we make the following contributions: 1) we propose FH-GAN network,\nan end-to-end system, that improves both face hallucination and face\nrecognition simultaneously. The novelty of this proposed network depends on\nincorporating identity information in a GAN-based face hallucination algorithm\nvia combining a face recognition network for identity preserving. 2) We also\npropose a new face hallucination network, namely Dense Sparse Network (DSNet),\nwhich improves upon the state-of-art in face hallucination. 3) We demonstrate\nbenefits of training the face recognition and GAN-based DSNet jointly by\nreporting good result on face hallucination and recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 05:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

It has been suggested, for instance, that nonlinear pulses\nsuch as action potentials (APs) can only exist if the membrane state is in\nvicinity of a TD transition. Herein, two membrane properties - excitability and\nAP velocity - are investigated for a broad spectrum of conditions in living\nsystems (temperature (T), 3D-pressure (p) and pH dependence). Based on these\ndata we predict parameter ranges in which a transition of the membrane is\nlocated (15-35{\\deg}C below growth temperature; 1-3 pH units below pH 7; at\n~800 atm) and propose the corresponding phase diagrams. The latter explain: (i)\nchanges of AP velocity with T, p and pH. (ii) The existence and origin of two\nqualitatively different forms of loss of nonlinear excitability (\"nerve\nblockage\", anesthesia). (iii) The type and quantity of parameter changes that\ntrigger APs. Finally, a quantitative comparison between the TD behaviour of\n2D-lipid model membranes with living systems is attempted. The typical shifts\nin transition temperature with pH and p of model membranes agree closely with\nvalues obtained from cell physiological measurements (excitability and\npropagation velocity). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that it\nis not specific molecules that control the excitability of living systems but\nrather the TD properties of the quasi 2D-membrane interface. The approach as\nproposed herein can be extended to other quantities (surface potential, calcium\nconcentration, etc.) and makes clearly falsifiable predictions, for example,\nthat a transition exists within the specified parameter ranges in excitable\ncells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 06:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 13:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

Although\ntraditional video codecs can estimate and compensate for block-level motions,\ntheir inter prediction performance is still heavily affected by the remaining\ninconsistent pixel-wise displacement caused by irregular rotation and\ndeformation. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a deep frame\ninterpolation network to generate additional reference frames in coding\nscenarios. First, we summarize the previous adaptive convolutions used for\nframe interpolation and propose a factorized kernel convolutional network to\nimprove the modeling capacity and simultaneously keep its compact form. Second,\nto better train this network, multi-domain hierarchical constraints are\nintroduced to regularize the training of our factorized kernel convolutional\nnetwork. For spatial domain, we use a gradually down-sampled and up-sampled\nauto-encoder to generate the factorized kernels for frame interpolation at\ndifferent scales. For quality domain, considering the inconsistent quality of\nthe input frames, the factorized kernel convolution is modulated with\nquality-related features to learn to exploit more information from high quality\nframes. For frequency domain, a sum of absolute transformed difference loss\nthat performs frequency transformation is utilized to facilitate network\noptimization from the view of coding performance. With the well-designed frame\ninterpolation network regularized by multi-domain hierarchical constraints, our\nmethod surpasses HEVC on average 6.1% BD-rate saving and up to 11.0% BD-rate\nsaving for the luma component under the random access configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 07:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

Whereas cooperation and defection are studied\nextensively in the literature on game theory, asymmetric exploitative\nrelationships between players are little explored. In a recent study, Press and\nDyson demonstrate that if only one player can learn about the other, asymmetric\nexploitation is achieved in the prisoner's dilemma game. In contrast, however,\nit is unknown whether such one-way exploitation is stably established when both\nplayers learn about each other symmetrically and try to optimize their payoffs.\nHere, we first formulate a dynamical system that describes the change in a\nplayer's probabilistic strategy with reinforcement learning to obtain greater\npayoffs, based on the recognition of the other player. By applying this\nformulation to the standard prisoner's dilemma game, we numerically and\nanalytically demonstrate that an exploitative relationship can be achieved\ndespite symmetric strategy dynamics and symmetric rule of games. This\nexploitative relationship is stable, even though the exploited player, who\nreceives a lower payoff than the exploiting player, has optimized the own\nstrategy. Whether the final equilibrium state is mutual cooperation, defection,\nor exploitation, crucially depends on the initial conditions: Punishment\nagainst a defector oscillates between the players, and thus a complicated basin\nstructure to the final equilibrium appears. In other words, slight differences\nin the initial state may lead to drastic changes in the final state.\nConsidering the generality of the result, this study provides a new perspective\non the origin of exploitation in society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 08:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

We show that the mean acceleration\n$\\langle \\partial_{t}^{2}a\\rangle$ can be negative or positive (depending on\nthe model) when the random fields take values beyond the classical range of\ninflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 09:18:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 22:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

In recent years,\nthe impact of stochastic physics has also been found to be beneficial for the\nmodel's long term climate. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time\nthat the inclusion of a stochastic physics scheme can notably affect a model's\nprojection of global warming, as well as its historical climatological global\ntemperature. Specifically, we find that when including the 'stochastically\nperturbed parametrisation tendencies' scheme (SPPT) in the fully coupled\nclimate model EC-Earth v3.1, the predicted level of global warming between 1850\nand 2100 is reduced by 10% under an RCP8.5 forcing scenario. We link this\nreduction in climate sensitivity to a change in the cloud feedbacks with SPPT.\nIn particular, the scheme appears to reduce the positive low cloud cover\nfeedback, and increase the negative cloud optical feedback. A key role is\nplayed by a robust, rapid increase in cloud liquid water with SPPT, which we\nspeculate is due to the scheme's non-linear interaction with condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 09:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Central to many concepts is the ability to control a\nsystem by electric and magnetic fields, relying on strong spin-orbit\ninteraction and a large g-factor. Here, we present a new mechanism for spin and\norbital manipulation using small electric and magnetic fields. By hybridizing\nspecific quantum dot states at two points inside InAs nanowires, nearly perfect\nquantum rings form. Large and highly anisotropic effective g-factors are\nobserved, explained by a strong orbital contribution. Importantly, we find that\nthe orbital and spin-orbital contributions can be efficiently quenched by\nsimply detuning the individual quantum dot levels with an electric field.

However, while the inner binary has been studied many\ntimes, information is missing on the other stars, in particular the third star\nwhose presence was indirectly postulated from recurrent modulations in the\nradio domain. Besides, to this date, the X-ray light curve could not be fully\ninterpreted, for example in the framework of colliding-wind emission linked to\none of the systems. We obtained new optical and X-ray observations of Cyg OB2\n#5, which we combined to archival data. We performed a thorough and homogeneous\ninvestigation of all available data, notably revisiting the times of primary\nminimum in photometry. In the X-ray domain, XMM-Newton provides scattered\nexposures over ~5000 d whilst Swift provides a nearly continuous monitoring for\nthe last couple of years. Although the X-ray light curve reveals clear\nvariability, no significant period can be found hence the high-energy emission\ncannot be explained solely in terms of colliding winds varying along either the\nshort or intermediate orbits.

While existing\nalgorithmic techniques usually aim at maximizing the total number of people\ninfluenced, the population often comprises several socially salient groups,\ne.g., based on gender or race. As a result, these techniques could lead to\ndisparity across different groups in receiving important information.\nFurthermore, in many of these applications, the spread of influence is\ntime-critical, i.e., it is only beneficial to be influenced before a time\ndeadline. As we show in this paper, the time-criticality of the information\ncould further exacerbate the disparity of influence across groups. This\ndisparity, introduced by algorithms aimed at maximizing total influence, could\nhave far-reaching consequences, impacting people's prosperity and putting\nminority groups at a big disadvantage. In this work, we propose a notion of\ngroup fairness in time-critical influence maximization.

Combinations of\nsystems of equations are usually solved by coupling finite element for solid\nmodelling and CFD models for fluid modelling or including material effects\nthrough boundary conditions rather than full material discretisation. Our\nsimultaneous solution methodology lies on the recasting of all the equations in\nthe same, hyperbolic form allowing their solution on the same grid with the\nsame finite-volume numerical schemes. We use a combination of sharp and diffuse\ninterface methods to track or capture material interfaces, depending on the\napplication. The communication between the distinct systems of equations (i.e.,\nmaterials separated by sharp interfaces) is facilitated by means of\nmixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which\nrepresent physical material boundaries. To this end we derive approximate mixed\nRiemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on characteristic\nequations.

This is the sixth, and\nsecond most distant, radio galaxy ever detected in the TeV regime. In this\narticle we present a radio and X-ray analysis of the jet in 3C 264. We\ndetermine the main physical parameters of the parsec-scale flow and explore the\nimplications of the inferred kinematic structure for radiative models of this\ngamma-ray emitting jet. The radio data set is comprised of VLBI observations at\n15 GHz from the MOJAVE program, and cover a time period of ~2 years. Through a\nsegmented wavelet decomposition method we estimate the apparent displacement of\nindividual plasma features; we then perform a pixel-based analysis of the\nstacked image to determine the jet shape. The X-ray data set includes all\navailable observations from the Chandra, XMM, and Swift satellites, and is\nused, together with archival data in the other bands, to build the SED. Proper\nmotion is mostly detected along the edges of the flow, which appears strongly\nlimb-brightened. The apparent speeds increase as a function of distance from\nthe core up to a maximum of ~$11.5$ c. This constrains the jet viewing angle to\nassume relatively small values ($\\theta\\lesssim10^{\\circ}$). In the\nacceleration region, extending up to a de-projected distance of\n~$4.8\\times10^4$ Schwarzschild radii (~$11$ pc), the jet is collimating\n($r\\propto z^{0.40\\pm 0.04}$), as predicted for a magnetically-driven plasma\nflow. By assuming that the core region is indeed magnetically dominated\n($U_B/U_e>1$), the SED and the jet power can be well reproduced in the\nframework of leptonic models, provided that the high-energy component is\nassociated to a second emitting region. The possibility that this region is\nlocated at the end of the acceleration zone, either in the jet layer or in the\nspine, is explored in the modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 10:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Most of the existing CF trackers adopt a cosine window to\nspatially reweight base image to alleviate boundary discontinuity. However,\ncosine window emphasizes more on the central region of base image and has the\nrisk of contaminating negative training samples during model learning. On the\nother hand, spatial regularization deployed in many recent CF trackers plays a\nsimilar role as cosine window by enforcing spatial penalty on CF coefficients.\nTherefore, we in this paper investigate the feasibility to remove cosine window\nfrom CF trackers with spatial regularization. When simply removing cosine\nwindow, CF with spatial regularization still suffers from small degree of\nboundary discontinuity. To tackle this issue, binary and Gaussian shaped mask\nfunctions are further introduced for eliminating boundary discontinuity while\nreweighting the estimation error of each training sample, and can be\nincorporated with multiple CF trackers with spatial regularization. In\ncomparison to the counterparts with cosine window, our methods are effective in\nhandling boundary discontinuity and sample contamination, thereby benefiting\ntracking performance.

To address this issue, the\npaper proposes a framework for pedestrian detection in videos based on the YOLO\nobject detection network [6] while having a high throughput of more than 5 FPS\non the Jetson TX2 embedded board. The framework exploits deep learning for\nrobust operation and uses a pre-trained model without the need for any\nadditional training which makes it flexible to apply on different setups with\nminimum amount of tuning.

Interactions of the beam with external fields,\nother particles in the same beam and the beam walls all present modelling\nchallenges. These can be challenging to model correctly even with modern\nsupercomputers. This paper describes OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator\nLibrary), a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear\naccelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. OPAL is built from the\nground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance\ncomputing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment.\nUsing the MAD language with extensions, OPAL can run on a laptop as well as on\nthe largest high performance computing systems. The OPAL framework makes it\neasy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes, enabling the modelling\nof many physics processes and field types. OPAL comes in two flavours:\nOPAL-cycl: tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns\nin cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent variable. OPAL-t: models\nbeam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and complete XFELs excluding the\nundulator. The code is managed through the git distributed version control\nsystem.

In spite of\ntheir theoretical benefits, the biLMs have not given notable improvements\ncompared to the uniLMs in their experiments. This is because their biLMs do not\nconsider the interaction between the two directions.

In detail,\nthe object localization task contains object localization without\nclassification, object detection and object instance segmentation. This task\nprovides the regions of the target object in the input data. The object pose\nestimation task mainly refers to estimating the 6D object pose and includes\ncorrespondence-based methods, template-based methods and voting-based methods,\nwhich affords the generation of grasp poses for known objects. The grasp\nestimation task includes 2D planar grasp methods and 6DoF grasp methods, where\nthe former is constrained to grasp from one direction. These three tasks could\naccomplish the robotic grasping with different combinations. Lots of object\npose estimation methods need not object localization, and they conduct object\nlocalization and object pose estimation jointly. Lots of grasp estimation\nmethods need not object localization and object pose estimation, and they\nconduct grasp estimation in an end-to-end manner. Both traditional methods and\nlatest deep learning-based methods based on the RGB-D image inputs are reviewed\nelaborately in this survey.

The Toeplitz algebra\nis the reduced semigroup $C^*$-algebra for the additive semigroup of\nnon-negative integers. It is known that every partially ordered set can be\nrepresented as the union of the family of its maximal upward directed subsets\nindexed by elements of some set. In our previous work we have studied a\ntopology on this set of indexes. For every maximal upward directed subset we\nconsider the inductive system of Toeplitz algebras that is defined by a given\ninductive system over an arbitrary partially ordered set and its inductive\nlimit.

The problem is to find a policy for generating updates that\nachieves the lowest possible time-average expected age penalty among all online\npolicies. We prove that one optimal solution of this problem is a monotone\nthreshold policy, which satisfies (i) each new update is sent out only when the\nage is higher than a threshold and (ii) the threshold is a non-increasing\nfunction of the instantaneous battery level.

For example, the data\ntrading market enables user-flexibility by allowing users to sell leftover data\nto or buy extra data from each other. The rollover mechanism enables\ntime-flexibility by allowing a user to utilize his own leftover data from the\nprevious month in the current month. In this paper, we investigate the economic\nviability of offering the data trading market together with the rollover\nmechanism, to gain a deeper understanding of the interrelationship between the\nuser-flexibility and the time-flexibility. We formulate the interactions\nbetween the MNO and mobile users as a multi-slot dynamic game. Specifically, in\neach time slot (e.g., every day), the MNO first determines the selling and\nbuying prices with the goal of revenue maximization, then each user decides his\ntrading action (by solving a dynamic programming problem) to maximize his\nlong-term payoff. Due to the availability of monthly data rollover, a user's\ndaily trading decision corresponds to a dynamic programming problem with two\ntime scales (i.e., day-to-day and month-to-month). Our analysis reveals an\noptimal trading policy with a target interval structure, specified by a\nbuy-up-to threshold and a sell-down-to threshold in each time slot. Moreover,\nwe show that the rollover mechanism makes users sell less and buy more data\ngiven the same trading prices, hence it increases the total demand while\ndecreasing the total supply in the data trading market. Finally, numerical\nresults based on real-world data unveil that the time-flexible rollover\nmechanism plays a positive role in the user-flexible data trading market,\nincreasing the MNO's revenue by 25% and all users' payoff by 17% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 12:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

Furthermore, the paper explores end-to-end\nsystems' ability to execute navigational commands and examines whether improved\nperformance can be achieved by utilizing temporal dependencies between\nsubsequent visual cues. Two end-to-end architectures are proposed: a\ntraditional Convolutional Neural Network and an extended design combining a\nConvolutional Neural Network with a recurrent layer. The models are trained\nusing expert driving data from a simulated urban setting, and are evaluated by\ntheir driving performance in an unseen simulated environment. The results of\nthis paper indicate that end-to-end systems can operate autonomously in simple\nurban environments. Moreover, it is found that the exploitation of temporal\ninformation in subsequent images enhances a system's ability to judge movement\nand distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 13:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

As annotating data is expensive and\ntime-consuming, it is difficult for an individual medical center to reach large\nenough sample sizes to build their own, personalized models. As an alternative,\ndata from all centers could be pooled to train a centralized model that\neveryone can use. However, such a strategy is often infeasible due to the\nprivacy-sensitive nature of medical data. Recently, federated learning (FL) has\nbeen introduced to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model across\ncenters without the need for sharing data. In FL, clients are locally training\nmodels on site-specific datasets for a few epochs and then sharing their model\nweights with a central server, which orchestrates the overall training process.\nImportantly, the sharing of models does not compromise patient privacy. A\ndisadvantage of FL is the dependence on a central server, which requires all\nclients to agree on one trusted central body, and whose failure would disrupt\nthe training process of all clients. In this paper, we introduce BrainTorrent,\na new FL framework without a central server, particularly targeted towards\nmedical applications. BrainTorrent presents a highly dynamic peer-to-peer\nenvironment, where all centers directly interact with each other without\ndepending on a central body. We demonstrate the overall effectiveness of FL for\nthe challenging task of whole brain segmentation and observe that the proposed\nserver-less BrainTorrent approach does not only outperform the traditional\nserver-based one but reaches a similar performance to a model trained on pooled\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 13:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

According to the standard point of view (which is in\nline with the logical tradition), quantum cloning amounts to two classical\nrules of inference, namely, monotonicity and idempotency of entailment. One can\nconclude then that the whole of quantum theory should be described through a\nlogic wherein these rules do not hold, which is linear logic.

The solid-state formation pathways of\nthese species under experimental conditions relevant to prestellar cores are\nprimarily based off of weak infrared transitions of the HOCO complex and\nusually pertain to the H2O-rich ice phase, and therefore more experimental data\nare desired. In this article, we present a new and additional solid-state\nreaction pathway that can form HCOOH and CO2 ice at 10 K 'non-energetically' in\nthe laboratory under conditions related to the \"heavy\" CO freeze-out stage in\ndense interstellar clouds, i.e., by the hydrogenation of an H2CO:O2 ice\nmixture. This pathway is used to piece together the HCOOH and CO2 formation\nroutes when H2CO or CO reacts with H and OH radicals. Temperature programmed\ndesorption - quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to confirm the\nformation and pathways of newly synthesized ice species as well as to provide\ninformation on relative molecular abundances. Reflection absorption infrared\nspectroscopy (RAIRS) is additionally employed to characterize reaction products\nand determine relative molecular abundances. We find that for the conditions\ninvestigated in conjunction with theoretical results from the literature,\nH+HOCO and HCO+OH lead to the formation of HCOOH ice in our experiments. Which\nreaction is more dominant can be determined if the H+HOCO branching ratio is\nmore constrained by computational simulations, as the HCOOH:CO2 abundance ratio\nis experimentally measured to be around 1.8:1. H+HOCO is more likely than OH+CO\n(without HOCO formation) to form CO2. Isotope experiments presented here\nfurther validate that H+HOCO is the dominant route for HCOOH ice formation in a\nCO-rich CO:O2 ice mixture that is hydrogenated.

As a potential solution, we propose to incorporate\ninput modeling and uncertainty quantification to improve load forecasting\nperformance via a two-stage approach. The proposed two-stage approach has the\nfollowing merits. (1) It provides input modeling and quantifies the impact of\ninput errors, rather than neglecting or mitigating the impact, a prevalent\npractice of existing methods.

Early attempts by McMillan and\nAllen and Dynes to improve on the weak-coupling BCS formula led to closed-form\napproximate relations between $T_c$ and various measures of the phonon spectrum\nand the electron-phonon interaction appearing in Eliashberg theory. Here we\npropose that these approaches can be improved with the use of machine learning\nalgorithms. As an initial test, we train a model for identifying\nlow-dimensional descriptors using the $T_c < 10$ K data tested by Allen and\nDynes, and show that a simple analytical expression thus obtained improves upon\nthe Allen-Dynes fit. Furthermore, the prediction for the recently discovered\nhigh $T_c$ material H$_3$S at high pressure is quite reasonable. Interestingly,\n$T_c$'s for more recently discovered superconducting systems with a more\ntwo-dimensional electron-phonon coupling, which do not follow Allen and Dynes'\nexpression, also do not follow our analytic expression. Thus, this machine\nlearning approach appears to be a powerful method for highlighting the need for\na new descriptor beyond those used by Allen and Dynes to describe their set of\nisotropic electron-phonon coupled superconductors. We argue that this machine\nlearning method, and its implied need for a descriptor characterizing Fermi\nsurface properties, represents a promising new approach to superconductor\nmaterials discovery which may eventually replace the serendipitous discovery\nparadigm begun by Kamerlingh Onnes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 14:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Most of\ncurrent studies on human attention and saliency modeling have used high quality\nstereotype stimuli. In real world, however, captured images undergo various\ntypes of transformations. Can we use these transformations to augment existing\nsaliency datasets? Here, we first create a novel saliency dataset including\nfixations of 10 observers over 1900 images degraded by 19 types of\ntransformations. Second, by analyzing eye movements, we find that observers\nlook at different locations over transformed versus original images. Third, we\nutilize the new data over transformed images, called data augmentation\ntransformation (DAT), to train deep saliency models. We find that label\npreserving DATs with negligible impact on human gaze boost saliency prediction,\nwhereas some other DATs that severely impact human gaze degrade the\nperformance. These label preserving valid augmentation transformations provide\na solution to enlarge existing saliency datasets. Finally, we introduce a novel\nsaliency model based on generative adversarial network (dubbed GazeGAN). A\nmodified UNet is proposed as the generator of the GazeGAN, which combines\nclassic skip connections with a novel center-surround connection (CSC), in\norder to leverage multi level features.

Recently, the concepts of plasmonicity index and the generalized\nplasmonicity index (GPI) have been devised as computational tools to quantify\nthe plasmonic nature of optical excitations. The question may arise whether any\nstrong absorption band, possibly with some sort of collective character in its\nmicroscopic origin, shares the status of plasmon.

Extending a result of R.\nBalan, we show that whether the statement generalizes to $(G,\\Lambda)$ is\nequivalent to the nontriviality of a certain vector bundle over the compact\nspace $(G/\\Lambda) \\times (\\widehat{G}/\\Lambda^{\\perp})$. We prove this\nequivalence using a connection between Gabor frames and Heisenberg modules.\nMore specifically, we show that the Zak transform can be viewed as an\nisomorphism of certain Hilbert $C^*$-modules. As an application, we prove a new\nBalian-Low theorem for the group $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}_p$, where\n$\\mathbb{Q}_p$ denotes the $p$-adic numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 15:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 09:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Combining these data with $P_{\\rm rot}$ for other clusters, we\nconclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is\ninvalid.

Greybox fuzzing is a\nlightweight test-generation approach that effectively detects bugs and security\nvulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs to\nexercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code that is guarded by\nnarrow checks, which are satisfied by no more than a few input values.\nMoreover, most real-world smart contracts transition through many different\nstates during their lifetime, e.g., for every bid in an auction. To explore\nthese states and thereby detect deep vulnerabilities, a greybox fuzzer would\nneed to generate sequences of contract transactions, e.g., by creating bids\nfrom multiple users, while at the same time keeping the search space and test\nsuite tractable. In this experience paper, we explain how Harvey alleviates\nboth challenges with two key fuzzing techniques and distill the main lessons\nlearned. First, Harvey extends standard greybox fuzzing with a method for\npredicting new inputs that are more likely to cover new paths or reveal\nvulnerabilities in smart contracts. Second, it fuzzes transaction sequences in\na targeted and demand-driven way. We have evaluated our approach on 27\nreal-world contracts.

For instance, in the medical domain, there are various statues at\nthe state and federal level that dictate who is permitted to work with\npatients' records and under what conditions. To screen for potential privacy\nbreaches, logging systems are usually deployed to trigger alerts whenever\nsuspicious access is detected. However, such mechanisms are often inefficient\nbecause 1) the vast majority of triggered alerts are false positives, 2) small\nbudgets make it unlikely that a real attack will be detected, and 3) attackers\ncan behave strategically, such that traditional auditing mechanisms cannot\neasily catch them. To improve efficiency, information systems may invoke\nsignaling, so that whenever a suspicious access request occurs, the system can,\nin real time, warn the user that the access may be audited. Then, at the close\nof a finite period, a selected subset of suspicious accesses are audited. This\ngives rise to an online problem in which one needs to determine 1) whether a\nwarning should be triggered and 2) the likelihood that the data request event\nwill be audited.

We study the properties of its\nStackelberg equilibria and develop a scalable approach to compute its solution.\nWe show that a strategic presentation of warnings adds value in that SAGs\nrealize significantly higher utility for the auditor than systems without\nsignaling.

Finally,\ntheir lifetime is observed to be dominated by finite-size effects, and more\nspecifically by the ratio of the localization length to their distance to the\nsystem boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 14:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 19:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Some symbols in the strings may be interpreted as\ninstructions for simulation software. Thus, the sequence can be used to model\nthe steps of a process. Currently, creating an L-system for a specific process\nis done by hand by experts through much effort. The inductive inference problem\nattempts to infer an L-system from such a sequence of strings generated by an\nunknown system; this can be thought of as an intermediate step to inferring\nfrom a sequence of images. This paper evaluates and analyzes different genetic\nalgorithm encoding schemes and mathematical properties for the L-system\ninductive inference problem. A new tool, the Plant Model Inference Tool for\nContext-Free L-systems (PMIT-D0L) is implemented based on these techniques.\nPMIT-D0L has been successfully evaluated on 28 known L-systems, with alphabets\nup to 31 symbols and a total sum of 281 symbols across the rewriting rules.\nPMIT-D0L can infer even the largest of these L-systems in less than a few\nseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 18:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 14:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}
