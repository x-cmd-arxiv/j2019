The existing QSL candidates all have\ntheir intrinsic disadvantages, however, and solid evidence for quantum\nfluctuations is scarce. Here we report a new compound,\nNa$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$, a geometrically frustrated system with effective\nspin-1/2 local moments for Co$^{2+}$ ions on an isotropic two-dimensional\ntriangular lattice. Magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering experiments\nshow no magnetic ordering down to 0.05 K. Thermodynamic measurements show that\nthere is a tremendous amount of magnetic entropy present below 1 K in zero\napplied magnetic field. The presence of localized low-energy spin fluctuations\nis revealed by inelastic neutron measurements. At low applied fields, these\nspin excitations are confined to low energy and contribute to the anomalously\nlarge specific heat. In larger applied fields, the system reverts to normal\nbehavior as evident by both neutron and thermodynamic results. Our experimental\ncharacterization thus reveals that this new material is an excellent candidate\nfor the experimental realization of a quantum spin liquid state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 16:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

This paper introduces\nLynceus, a new approach for the optimization of cloud based data analytic jobs\nthat improves overstate-of-the-art approaches by enabling significant cost\nsavings both in terms of the final recommended configuration and of the\noptimization process used to recommend configurations.

Nonetheless, a limitation is that they rely\non the availability of large-scale clean-labeled data, which are often\nlaborious or impractical to collect in a real-world scenario. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel model called the label-noise robust\nimage-to-image translation model (RMIT) that can learn a clean label\nconditional generator even when noisy labeled data are only available. In\nparticular, we propose a novel loss called the virtual cycle consistency loss\nthat is able to regularize cyclic reconstruction independently of noisy labeled\ndata, as well as we introduce advanced techniques to boost the performance in\npractice. Our experimental results demonstrate that RMIT is useful for\nobtaining label-noise robustness in various settings including synthetic and\nreal-world noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 17:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

A SAS often operates in dynamic and partially unknown\nenvironments, which cause uncertainty that the SAS has to address to achieve\nits goals. Moreover, besides the environment, other classes of uncertainty have\nbeen identified. However, these various classes and their sources are not\nsystematically addressed by current approaches throughout the life cycle of the\nSAS. In general, uncertainty typically makes the assurance provision of SAS\ngoals exclusively at design time not viable. This calls for an assurance\nprocess that spans the whole life cycle of the SAS. In this work, we propose a\ngoal-oriented assurance process that supports taming different sources (within\ndifferent classes) of uncertainty from defining the goals at design time to\nperforming self-adaptation at runtime. Based on a goal model augmented with\nuncertainty annotations, we automatically generate parametric symbolic formulae\nwith parameterized uncertainties at design time using symbolic model checking.\nThese formulae and the goal model guide the synthesis of adaptation policies by\nengineers. At runtime, the generated formulae are evaluated to resolve the\nuncertainty and to steer the self-adaptation using the policies. In this paper,\nwe focus on reliability and cost properties, for which we evaluate our approach\non the Body Sensor Network (BSN) implemented in OpenDaVINCI. The results of the\nvalidation are promising and show that our approach is able to systematically\ntame multiple classes of uncertainty, and that it is effective and efficient in\nproviding assurances for the goals of self-adaptive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 18:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

Taking Type I and Type II 2HDM as illustration, and assuming a\nscalar gauge singlet dark matter particle, we show that the heavy neutral\nCP-even scalar ($H$) can (a) serve as dark matter portal consistently with all\ndata, and (b) have a substantial invisible branching ratio, over a wide region\nof the parameter space.

This is useful for program comprehension, testing, and anomaly\ndetection. However, specification mining can also potentially be used for\ndebugging, where a faulty behavior is abstracted to give developers a context\nabout the bug and help them locating it. Objective: In this project, we\ninvestigate this idea in an industrial setting. We propose a very basic\nsemi-automated specification mining approach for debugging and apply that on\nreal reported issues from an AutoPilot software system from our industry\npartner, MicroPilot Inc. The objective is to assess the feasibility and\nusefulness of the approach in a real-world setting. Method: The approach is\ndeveloped as a prototype tool, working on C code, which accept a set of\nrelevant state fields and functions, per issue, and generates an extended\nfinite state machine that represents the faulty behavior, abstracted with\nrespect to the relevant context (the selected fields and functions). Results:\nWe qualitatively evaluate the approach by a set of interviews (including\nobservational studies) with the company's developers on their real-world\nreported bugs. The results show that a) our approach is feasible, b) it can be\nautomated to some extent, and c) brings advantages over only using their\ncode-level debugging tools. We also compared this approach with traditional\nfully automated state-merging algorithms and reported several issues when\napplying those techniques on a real-world debugging context. Conclusion: The\nmain conclusion of this study is that the idea of an \"interactive\"\nspecification mining rather than a fully automated mining tool is NOT\nimpractical and indeed is useful for the debugging use case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 19:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

We\nfirst modify the asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm and present an\nepisode-based training mechanism for DeepRMSA, namely, DeepRMSA-EP.

To overcome the instability issue in the\ntraining of DeepRMSA-EP due to the oscillations of cumulative rewards, we\nfurther propose a window-based flexible training mechanism, i.e., DeepRMSA-FLX.\nDeepRMSA-FLX attempts to smooth out the oscillations by defining the\noptimization scope at each step as a sliding window, and ensuring that the\ncumulative rewards always include rewards from a fixed number of requests.\nEvaluations with the two sample topologies show that DeepRMSA-FLX can\neffectively stabilize the training while achieving blocking probability\nreductions of more than 20.3% and 14.3%, when compared with the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 19:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 18:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Since the addition of covert information\ninevitably decreases the SNR of the primary transmission, key challenges in\nwireless steganography are: i) to assess the impact of the covert channel on\nthe primary channel as a function of different channel conditions; and ii) to\nmake sure that the covert channel is undetectable. Existing approaches are\nprotocol-specific, also we notice that existing wireless technologies rely on\nphase-keying modulations that in most cases do not use the channel up to its\nShannon capacity. Therefore, the residual capacity can be leveraged to\nimplement a wireless system based on a pseudo-noise asymmetric shift keying\n(PN-ASK) modulation, where covert symbols are mapped by shifting the amplitude\nof primary symbols. This way, covert information will be undetectable, since a\nreceiver expecting phase-modulated symbols will see their shift in amplitude as\nan effect of channel/path loss degradation. We first investigate the SER of\nPN-ASK as a function of the channel; then, we find the optimal PN-ASK\nparameters that optimize primary and covert throughput under different channel\ncondition. We evaluate the throughput performance and undetectability of PN-ASK\nthrough extensive simulations and on an experimental testbed based on USRP N210\nsoftware-defined radios.

The\nsteady increase in amount and complexity of data over the years led to\nimprovements and development of new clustering algorithms. However, algorithms\nthat can cluster data with mixed variable types (continuous and categorical)\nremain limited, despite the abundance of data with mixed types particularly in\nthe medical field. Among existing methods for mixed data, some posit\nunverifiable distributional assumptions or that the contributions of different\nvariable types are not well balanced.\n  We propose a two-step hybrid density- and partition-based algorithm (HyDaP)\nthat can detect clusters after variables selection. The first step involves\nboth density-based and partition-based algorithms to identify the data\nstructure formed by continuous variables and recognize the important variables\nfor clustering; the second step involves partition-based algorithm together\nwith a novel dissimilarity measure we designed for mixed data to obtain\nclustering results. Simulations across various scenarios and data structures\nwere conducted to examine the performance of the HyDaP algorithm compared to\ncommonly used methods. We also applied the HyDaP algorithm on electronic health\nrecords to identify sepsis phenotypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 20:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

The algorithm, named Maximally Filtered Clique Forest (MFCF),\nproduces a clique forest and an associated Markov Random Field (MRF) by\ngeneralising Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, the MFCF presents three elements of novelty with respect to existing\nstructure learning approaches. The first is the repeated application of a local\ntopological move, the clique expansion, that preserves the decomposability of\nthe underlying graph. Through this move the decomposability and calculation of\nscores is performed incrementally at the variable (rather than edge) level, and\nthis provides better computational performance and an intuitive application of\nmultivariate statistical tests. The second is the capability to accommodate a\nvariety of score functions and, while this paper is focused on multivariate\nnormal distributions, it can be directly generalised to different types of\nstatistics. Finally, the third is the variable range of allowed clique sizes\nwhich is an adjustable topological constraint that acts as a topological\npenalizer providing a way to tackle sparsity at $l_0$ semi-norm level; this\nallows a clean decoupling of structure learning and parameter estimation. The\nMFCF produces a representation of the clique forest, together with a perfect\nordering of the cliques and a perfect elimination ordering for the vertices. As\nan example we propose an application to covariance selection models and we show\nthat the MCFC outperforms the Graphical Lasso for a number of classes of\nmatrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 21:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 16:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

The ED string matching (EDSM) problem is to find all occurrences of\na pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. An $O(nm^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\log m}+N)$-time\nalgorithm for EDSM is known [Aoyama et al., CPM 2018]. The standard assumption\nin the prior work on this question is that $N$ is substantially larger than\nboth $n$ and $m$, and thus we would like to have a linear dependency on the\nformer. Under this assumption, the natural open problem is whether we can\ndecrease the 1.5 exponent in the time complexity, similarly as in the related\n(but, to the best of our knowledge, not equivalent) word break problem [Backurs\nand Indyk, FOCS 2016].\n  Our starting point is a conditional lower bound for EDSM. We use the popular\ncombinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture stating that there\nis no truly subcubic combinatorial algorithm for BMM [Abboud and Williams, FOCS\n2014]. By designing an appropriate reduction we show that a combinatorial\nalgorithm solving the EDSM problem in $O(nm^{1.5-e}+N)$ time, for any $e>0$,\nrefutes this conjecture. Our reduction should be understood as an indication\nthat decreasing the exponent requires fast matrix multiplication.\n  String periodicity and fast Fourier transform are two standard tools in\nstring algorithms.

In particular, using the\nfact that $\\omega<2.373$ [Le Gall, ISSAC 2014; Williams, STOC 2012], we obtain\nan $O(nm^{1.373}+N)$-time algorithm for EDSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 00:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 16:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 15:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Deep generative models\n(e.g., Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) and semisupervised Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) have recently shown promising performance in semi-supervised\nclassification for the excellent discriminative representing ability. However,\nthe latent code learned by the traditional VAE is not exclusive (repeatable)\nfor a specific input sample, which prevents it from excellent classification\nperformance. In particular, the learned latent representation depends on a\nnon-exclusive component which is stochastically sampled from the prior\ndistribution. Moreover, the semi-supervised GAN models generate data from\npre-defined distribution (e.g., Gaussian noises) which is independent of the\ninput data distribution and may obstruct the convergence and is difficult to\ncontrol the distribution of the generated data. To address the aforementioned\nissues, we propose a novel Adversarial Variational Embedding (AVAE) framework\nfor robust and effective semi-supervised learning to leverage both the\nadvantage of GAN as a high quality generative model and VAE as a posterior\ndistribution learner. The proposed approach first produces an exclusive latent\ncode by the model which we call VAE++, and meanwhile, provides a meaningful\nprior distribution for the generator of GAN. The proposed approach is evaluated\nover four different real-world applications and we show that our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models, which confirms that the combination of\nVAE++ and GAN can provide significant improvements in semisupervised\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 05:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 02:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

However, the acquisition of the CCM leads to unacceptable\noverhead in massive MIMO systems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we\npropose a novel scheme for the DL channel tracking. First, with the help of\nvirtual channel representation (VCR), we build a dynamic uplink (UL) massive\nMIMO channel model with the consideration of off-grid refinement. Then, a\ncoordinate-wise maximization based expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is\nadopted for capturing the model parameters, including the spatial signatures,\nthe time-correlation factors, the off-grid bias, the channel power, and the\nnoise power. Thanks to the angle reciprocity, the spatial signatures,\ntimecorrelation factors and off-grid bias of the DL channel model can be\nreconstructed with the knowledge of UL ones. However, the other two kinds of\nmodel parameters are closely related with the carrier frequency, which cannot\nbe perfectly inferred from the UL ones. Instead of relearning the DL model\nparameters with dedicated training, we resort to the optimal Bayesian Kalman\nfilter (OBKF) method to accurately track the DL channel with the partially\nprior knowledge. At the same time, the model parameters will be gradually\nrestored. Specially, the factor-graph and the Metropolis Hastings MCMC are\nutilized within the OBKF framework.

In contrast to the\nposterior retina, imaging the anterior tissue structures, such as the limbus\nand cornea, results in B-scans that exhibit increased speckle noise patterns\nand imaging artifacts. These artifacts, such as shadowing and specularity, pose\na challenge during the analysis of the acquired volumes as they substantially\nobfuscate the location of tissue interfaces. To deal with the artifacts and\nspeckle noise patterns and accurately segment the shallowest tissue interface,\nwe propose a cascaded neural network framework, which comprises of a\nconditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and a Tissue Interface\nSegmentation Network (TISN). The cGAN pre-segments OCT B-scans by removing\nundesired specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns just above the\nshallowest tissue interface, and the TISN combines the original OCT image with\nthe pre-segmentation to segment the shallowest interface.

In this work, we classify adjacent\npolarized sources in the NVSS as random or physical pairs. We recompute and\ncorrect the uncertainties in the NVSS RM catalog, since these were\nsignificantly overestimated. Our sample contains 317 physical and 5111 random\npairs, all with Galactic latitudes $|b|\\ge20^{\\circ}$, polarization fractions\n$\\ge2\\%$, and angular separations between $1.^{'},$ and $20^{'}$.

However, DNNs exhibit\nidiosyncrasies that suggest their visual representation and processing might be\nsubstantially different from human vision. One limitation of DNNs is that they\nare vulnerable to adversarial examples, input images on which subtle, carefully\ndesigned noises are added to fool a machine classifier. The robustness of the\nhuman visual system against adversarial examples is potentially of great\nimportance as it could uncover a key mechanistic feature that machine vision is\nyet to incorporate. In this study, we compare the visual representations of\nwhite- and black-box adversarial examples in DNNs and humans by leveraging\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We find a small but significant\ndifference in representation patterns for different (i.e. white- versus black-\nbox) types of adversarial examples for both humans and DNNs. However, human\nperformance on categorical judgment is not degraded by noise regardless of the\ntype unlike DNN.

Of particular importance is the ubiquitous charge\norder features that have been observed in a variety of cuprates, especially in\nthe underdoped regime of the phase diagram. To explain the origin of the charge\norder and its implication to the superconducting phase, many theoretical models\nhave been proposed, such as charge stripes, electronic nematicity, and Fermi\nsurface instability. A highly appealing physical picture is the so-called pair\ndensity wave (PDW), a periodic modulation of Cooper paring in space, which may\nalso induce a charge order. To elucidate the existence and nature of the PDW\norder, here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate a\nseverely underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta}, in which superconductivity just\nemerges on top of a pronounced checkerboard charge order. By analyzing the\nspatial distribution of the spectral features characteristic of\nsuperconductivity, we observe a periodic modulation of both the superconducting\ncoherence peak and gap depth, demonstrating the existence of a density wave\norder of Cooper pairing. The PDW order has the same spatial periodicity as the\ncharge order, and the amplitudes of the two orders exhibit clear positive\ncorrelation. These results shed important new lights on the origin of and\ninterplay between the charge order and Cooper pairing modulation in the\ncuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 09:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

Ice\nmantle growth results from gas molecules impinging on the dust from all\ndirections and incidence angles.

Vacuum-ultraviolet\nspectroscopy and a Ni-mesh measured the emission of the ultraviolet lamp.\nMolecules ejected from the ice to the gas during irradiation or warm-up were\ncharacterized by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The photodesorption rate of CO\nice deposited at 11 K and different incident angles was rather stable between 0\nand 45$^{\\circ}$. A maximum in the CO photodesorption rate appeared around\n70$^{\\circ}$-incidence deposition angle. The same deposition angle leads to the\nmaximum surface area of water ice. Although this study of the surface area\ncould not be performed for CO ice, the similar angle dependence in the\nphotodesorption and the ice surface area suggests that they are closely\nrelated. Further evidence for a dependence of CO ice morphology on deposition\nangle is provided by thermal desorption of CO ice experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 09:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

Before\nproceeding to studies of linear time-varying metamaterials and metasurfaces\nwith their effective parameters, we need to rigorously describe the electric\nand magnetic responses of a temporally-modulated meta-atom.

An emerging alternative is to use a\ndecision support system (DSS), which typically relies on gaining insights from\nobservational data in order to assist a customer in making decisions regarding\noptimal deployment or redeployment of cloud applications. The primary activity\nof such systems is the generation of a prediction model (e.g. using machine\nlearning), which requires a significantly large amount of training data.\nHowever, considering the varying architectures of applications, cloud\nproviders, and cloud offerings, this activity is not sustainable as it incurs\nadditional time and cost to collect training data and subsequently train the\nmodels.

The physical relations of the LyC\nescape with H I covering fraction, kinematics, spectral hardness, and the\nemergent Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) line profiles are studied using a series\nof RHD turbulence simulations performed with RAMSES-RT. The\nturbulence-regulated mechanism allows ionizing photons to leak out at early\ntimes before the onset of supernova feedback. The LyC photons escape through\nturbulence-generated low column density channels which are evacuated\nefficiently by radiative feedback via photoheating-induced shocks across the\nD-type ionization fronts. Ly$\\alpha$ photons funnel through the photoionized\nchannels along the paths of LyC escape, resulting in a diverse Ly$\\alpha$\nspectral morphology including narrow double-peaked profiles. The Ly$\\alpha$\npeak separation is controlled by the residual H I column density of the\nchannels and the line asymmetry correlates with the porosity and multiphase\nstructure of the H II region.

The `irrotational' resultants can\nthen be identified as classical `added mass', but the remaining, `rotational',\nresultants appear not to be consistent with the physical interpretation of the\nrotational velocity field (as that arising from the fluid vorticity with the\nbody stationary). The alternative presented here splits the inviscid resultants\ninto components that are unquestionably due to independent aspects of the\nproblem: `convective' and `accelerative'. The former are associated with the\npressure field that would arise in an inviscid flow with (instantaneously) the\nsame velocities as the real one, and with the body's velocity parameters ---\nangular and translational --- unchanging. The latter correspond to the pressure\ngenerated when the body accelerates from rest in quiescent fluid with its given\nrates of change of angular and translational velocity. They are reminiscent of\nthe added-mass force resultants, but are simpler, and closer to the standard\nrigid-body inertia formulae, than the developed expressions for added-mass\nforce and moment. Finally, the force resultants due to viscosity also include a\ncontribution from pressure. Its presence is necessary in order to satisfy the\nequations governing the pressure field, and it has previously been recognised\nin the context of `excess' stagnation-point pressure.

Although compressing data in write\naccesses to NVMs on-the-fly reduces the bit-writes in NVMs, existing precise or\napproximate compression schemes show limited performance improvements for data\nof bitmaps, due to the irregular data patterns and variance in data. We observe\nthat the data containing bitmaps show the pixel-level similarity due to the\nanalogous contents in adjacent pixels.

LRR has a good capacity to capture the underlying lowdimensional\nsubspaces embedded in original data. However, there are still two drawbacks for\nLRR. First, LRR does not consider the local geometric structure within data,\nwhich makes the local correlation among neighboring data easily ignored.\nSecond, the representation obtained by solving LRR is not discriminative enough\nto separate different data. In this paper, a novel locality and structure\nregularized low rank representation (LSLRR) model is proposed for HSI\nclassification. To overcome the above limitations, we present locality\nconstraint criterion (LCC) and structure preserving strategy (SPS) to improve\nthe classical LRR. Specifically, we introduce a new distance metric, which\ncombines both spatial and spectral features, to explore the local similarity of\npixels. Thus, the global and local structures of HSI data can be exploited\nsufficiently. Besides, we propose a structure constraint to make the\nrepresentation have a near block-diagonal structure. This helps to determine\nthe final classification labels directly. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on three popular HSI datasets.

This requires us to pay careful attention to the interplay between mesh\nquality and numerical algorithms. Methods have been designed that fundamentally\nintegrate high order isoparametric mappings with the other high accuracy\nalgorithms that are needed for divergence-free MHD simulations on geodesic\nmeshes. The goal of this paper is to document such algorithms that are\nimplemented in the geodesic mesh version of the RIEMANN code. The fluid\nvariables are reconstructed using a special kind of WENO-AO algorithm that\nintegrates the mesh geometry into the reconstruction process from the\nground-up. A novel divergence-free reconstruction strategy for the magnetic\nfield that performs efficiently at all orders, even on isoparametrically mapped\nmeshes, is then presented. The MHD equations are evolved in space and time\nusing a novel ADER predictor algorithm that is efficiently adapted to the\nisoparametrically mapped geometry. The application of one-dimensional and\nmultidimensional Riemann solvers at suitable locations on the mesh then\nprovides the corrector step. The corrector step for the magnetic field uses a\nYee-type staggering of magnetic fields. This results in a scheme with\ndivergence-free update for the magnetic field. The use of ADER enables a\none-step update which only requires one messaging operation per complete\ntimestep. This is very beneficial for parallel processing. Several accuracy\ntests are presented as are stringent test problems. PetaScale performance is\nalso demonstrated on the largest available supercomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 12:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Another drawback is\nthe requirement of additional techniques to access time correlation functions\n(ring polymer MD or centroid MD). We developed an alternative technique based\non a quantum thermal bath (QTB) which reduces the computation time by a factor\nof ~20. The QTB approach consists in a classical Langevin dynamics in which the\nwhite noise random force is replaced by a Gaussian random force having the\npower spectral density given by the quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nThe method has yielded satisfactory results for weakly anharmonic systems: the\nquantum harmonic oscillator, the heat capacity of a MgO crystal, and isotope\neffects in 7 LiH and 7 LiD. Unfortunately, the QTB is subject to the problem of\nzero-point energy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonic systems, which is\ninherent in the use of classical mechanics. Indeed, a part of the energy of the\nhigh-frequency modes is transferred to the low-frequency modes leading to a\nwrong energy distribution. We have shown that in order to reduce or even\neliminate ZPEL, it is sufficient to increase the value of the frictional\ncoefficient. Another way to solve the ZPEL problem is to combine the QTB and\nPIMD techniques. It requires the modification of the power spectral density of\nthe random force within the QTB. This combination can also be seen as a way to\nspeed up the PIMD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 13:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

This mixture problem is typically solved\nby a sequential solution that applies demosaicing (DM), denoising (DN), and\nsuper-resolution (SR) sequentially in a fixed and predefined pipeline\n(execution order of tasks), DM$\\to$DN$\\to$SR. The most recent work on image\nprocessing focuses on developing more sophisticated architectures to achieve\nhigher image quality. Little attention has been paid to the design of the\npipeline, and it is still not clear how significant the pipeline is to image\nquality. In this work, we comprehensively study the effects of pipelines on the\nmixture problem of learning-based DN, DM, and SR, in both sequential and joint\nsolutions.

The current descriptive\nevaluation method is based on four-valued logic. Assessing all students with\nonly four values is led to a lack of relative justice and the creation of\nunrealistic equality. Also, the complexity of the evaluation process in the\ncurrent method increases teacher errors likelihood. As a suitable solution, in\nthis paper, a fuzzy descriptive evaluation system has been proposed. The\nproposed method is based on fuzzy logic, which is an infinite-valued logic and\nit can perform approximate reasoning on natural language propositions. By the\nproposed fuzzy system, student assessment is performed over the school year\nwith infinite values instead of four values. But to eliminate the diversity of\nassigned values to students, at the end of the school year, the calculated\nvalues for each student will be rounded to the nearest value of the four\nstandard values of the current descriptive evaluation system. It can be\nimplemented easily in an appropriate smartphone app, which makes it much easier\nfor the teachers to evaluate the evaluation process. In this paper, the\nevaluation process of the elementary third-grade mathematics course in Iran\nduring the period from the beginning of the MEHR (The Seventh month of Iran) to\nthe end of BAHMAN (The Eleventh Month of Iran) is examined by the proposed\nsystem.

We present both Stark shifts\nand dissociation rates for excitons in various TMDs calculated within the\nMott-Wannier model. Here, we find that the field induced dissociation rate is\nstrongly dependent on the dielectric screening environment. Furthermore,\napplying weak-field asymptotic theory (WFAT) to the Keldysh potential, we are\nable to derive an analytical expression for exciton dissociation rates in the\nweak-field region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 13:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Despite its relevance, the exact OPPM problem suffers\nfrom two major drawbacks: 1) the inability to deal with indetermination in the\ntext, thus preventing the analysis of noisy time series; and 2) the inability\nto deal with indetermination in the pattern, thus imposing the strict\nsatisfaction of the orders among all pattern positions.

The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is optimised for\ndetecting planets in this regime, which allows for further analysis of the\nsub-Jovian desert.\n  Aims: With high-precision photometric surveys (e.g. with NGTS and TESS),\nwhich aim to detect short period planets especially around M/K-type host stars,\nstellar parameters need to be accounted for when empirical data are compared to\nmodel predictions.

Optimal control of a real-world complex\nsystem has many applications, including road traffic management, epidemic\nprevention, and information dissemination. However, such real-world complex\nsystem control is difficult to achieve because of high-dimensional and\nnon-linear system dynamics, and the exploding state and action spaces for the\ndecision maker. Prior methods can be divided into two categories:\nsimulation-based and analytical approaches. Existing simulation approaches have\nhigh-variance in Monte Carlo integration, and the analytical approaches suffer\nfrom modeling inaccuracy. We adopted simulation modeling in specifying the\ncomplex dynamics of a complex system, and developed analytical solutions for\nsearching optimal strategies in a complex network with high-dimensional\nstate-action space. To capture the complex system dynamics, we formulate the\ncomplex social network decision making problem as a discrete event decision\nprocess. To address the curse of dimensionality and search in high-dimensional\nstate action spaces in complex systems, we reduce control of a complex system\nto variational inference and parameter learning, introduce Bethe entropy\napproximation, and develop an expectation propagation algorithm.

However, it remains a\nchallenge to track the proximity-based interactions of a whole community and\nthen model the social diffusion of diseases and behaviors starting from the\nobservations of a small fraction of the volunteer population. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach that tries to connect together these sparse\nobservations using a model of how individuals interact with each other and how\nsocial interactions happen in terms of a sequence of proximity interactions. We\napply our approach to track the spreading of flu in the spatial-proximity\nnetwork of a 3000-people university campus by mobilizing 300 volunteers from\nthis population to monitor nearby mobile phones through Bluetooth scanning and\nto daily report flu symptoms about and around them. Our aim is to predict the\nlikelihood for an individual to get flu based on how often her/his daily\nroutine intersects with those of the volunteers. Thus, we use the daily\nroutines of the volunteers to build a model of the volunteers as well as of the\nnon-volunteers. Our results show that we can predict flu infection two weeks\nahead of time with an average precision from 0.24 to 0.35 depending on the\namount of information. This precision is six to nine times higher than with a\nrandom guess model. At the population level, we can predict infectious\npopulation in a two-week window with an r-squared value of 0.95 (a random-guess\nmodel obtains an r-squared value of 0.2).

The higher the uncertainty in the generation, the greater the\noperating-reserve requirements, which translates to an increased cost of\noperation. In this research work, we propose a unified architecture for\nmulti-time-scale predictions for intra-day solar irradiance forecasting using\nrecurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs).\nThis paper also lays out a framework for extending this modeling approach to\nintra-hour forecasting horizons thus, making it a multi-time-horizon\nforecasting approach, capable of predicting intra-hour as well as intra-day\nsolar irradiance.

The robustness of the approach is\ndemonstrated with case studies conducted for geographically scattered sites\nacross the United States.

In this work, we\npropose a general protocol for computing NOCI ground and excited state energies\nusing multiple HF solutions. To do so, we outline an active space variation of\nSCF metadynamics that allows a chemically relevant set of HF states to be\nidentified, and describe how these states can be routinely traced across all\nmolecular geometries by exploiting the topology of h-HF solutions in the\ncomplex plane. Finally, we illustrate our approach using the dissociation of\nthe fluorine dimer and the pseudo-Jahn--Teller distortion of cyclobutadiene,\ndemonstrating its applicability for multireference ground and excited states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 14:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

Both of these\nsystems project to the striatum, which is a key neural structure in the brain's\nimplementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Current deep RL approaches share\nsimilarities with a 'neocortical' system because they slowly learn distributed\nrepresentations through backpropagation in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). An\nongoing criticism of such approaches is that they are data inefficient and lack\nflexibility. CLS theory suggests that the addition of a 'hippocampal' system\ncould address these criticisms. In the present study we propose a novel\nalgorithm known as Complementary Temporal Difference Learning (CTDL), which\ncombines a DNN with a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to obtain the benefits of both\na 'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' system.

We evaluate CTDL on grid worlds and the\nCart-Pole environment, and show several benefits over the classic Deep\nQ-Network (DQN) approach.

For our\nsimulated parameters, the optimal p-i-n+ SPADs show the best device\nperformance, with a saturated PDE of 52.4 +/- 0.6% at a reverse bias voltage of\n31.5 V, full-width-half-max (FWHM) timing jitter of 10 ps, and a DCR of < 5\ncounts per second at 243 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 15:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

We form the virtual cells using\nhierarchical clustering with a minimax linkage criterion given a particular\nnumber of such cells. Once the virtual cells are formed, we consider an\ninterference coordination model in which base-stations in a virtual cell\njointly allocate the channels and power to users within the virtual cell. We\npropose two new schemes for solving this mixed integer NP-hard resource\nallocation problem. The first scheme transforms the problem into a continuous\nvariables problem; the second scheme proposes a new channel allocation method\nand then alternately solves the channel allocation problem using this new\nmethod, and the power allocation problem. We evaluate the average system sum\nrate of these schemes for a variable number of virtual cells. These results\nquantify the sum-rate along a continuum of fully-centralized versus\nfully-distributed optimization for different clustering and resource allocation\nstrategies. These results indicate that the penalty of fully-distributed\noptimization versus fully-centralized (cloud RAN) can be as high as 50%.\nHowever, if designed properly, a few base stations within a virtual cell using\nneighborhood-based optimization have almost the same performance as\nfully-centralized optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 18:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

Next, we studied the impact of mutation rate and showed that\nincreasing mutation rate generally results in an increased similarity between\nthe cancer exome and pathogen DNA, at a scale of 4-5 amino acids. Finally, we\ninvestigated whether the considered mutational processes result in amino-acid\nchanges with functional relevance that are more likely to be immunogenic. We\nshowed that functional tolerance to mutagenic processes across species\ngenerally suggests more resilience to mutagenic processes that are due to\nexposure to elements of nature than to mutagenic processes that are due to\nexposure to cancer-causing artificial substances. These results support the\nidea that recognition of pathogen sequences as well as differential functional\ntolerance to mutagenic processes may play an important role in the immune\nrecognition process involved in tumor infiltration by lymphocytes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 15:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Therefore, this paper is investigating\nthe application of machine learning, namely object detection methods to aid in\nthe analysis of physical porotypes. With access to a large dataset of digitally\ncaptured physical prototypes from early-stage development projects (5950 images\nfrom 850 prototypes), the authors investigate applications that can be used for\nanalysing this dataset. The authors retrained two pre-trained object detection\nmodels from two known frameworks, the TensorFlow Object Detection API and\nDarknet, using custom image sets of images of physical prototypes. As a result,\na proof-of-concept of four trained models are presented; two models for\ndetecting samples of wood-based sheet materials and two models for detecting\nsamples containing microcontrollers. All models are evaluated using standard\nmetrics for object detection model performance and the applicability of using\nobject detection models in engineering design research is discussed. Results\nindicate that the models can successfully classify the type of material and\ntype of pre-made component, respectively. However, more work is needed to fully\nintegrate object detection models in the engineering design analysis workflow.\nThe authors also extrapolate that the use of object detection for analysing\nimages of physical prototypes will substantially reduce the effort required for\nanalysing large datasets in engineering design research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 07:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

We\nevaluate our findings collaborating with the GitLab organization, analyzing 117\nof their open source projects. We show that we are able to restore their\nengineering organization in broad strokes, and also reveal hidden coding\ncollaborations as well as justify in-house technical decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 15:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

Such an approach implicitly\nprovides useful information about the role of different features (or design\nparameters such as geometry) of the nanostructure in its response\nfunctionality. To demonstrate the practical capabilities of this DL-based\ntechnique, we apply it to a reconfigurable optical metadevice enabling\ndual-band and triple-band optical absorption in the telecommunication window.\nCombination of the proposed approach with existing commercialized full-wave\nsimulation tools offers a powerful toolkit to extract basic mechanisms of\nwave-matter interaction in complex EM devices and facilitate the design and\noptimization of nanostructures for a large range of applications including\nimaging, spectroscopy, and signal processing. It is worth to mention that the\ndemonstrated approach is general and can be used in a large range of problems\nas long as enough training data can be provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 01:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In this comment\nwe show that it is, however, possible to construct a non-contextual model which\nexplains the experimental data via direct influences, which we take to mean\nthat a measurement outcome has a (model-specific) causal dependence on other\nmeasurements. We trace the apparent inconsistency to a definition of signalling\nwhich does not account for all possible forms of direct influence.

Usually, the wall\npressure fluctuations of the TBL are described through statistical quantities\n(i.e. space-frequency or wavenumber-frequency spectra) which depend on the TBL\nparameters. On the other hand, the vibro-acoustic models (i.e. Finite Elements,\nBoundary Elements, Transfer Matrix Methods, Analytical models, etc) evaluate\ndeterministic transfer functions which characterise the response of the\nconsidered structures. The first part of this paper focuses on the coupling\nbetween the stochastic TBL and the deterministic vibro-acoustic models. Five\ntechniques are presented. Numerical applications on an academic marine test\ncase are proposed in order to discuss the calculation parameters and the\ninterests / drawbacks of each technique.
