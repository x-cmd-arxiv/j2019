Almost all driven coronal loop oscillations (e.g., by flares)\nare observed to damp through time often with Gaussian or exponential profiles.\nIntriguingly, however, it has been shown theoretically that the amplitudes of\nsome oscillations could be modified from Gaussian or exponential profiles if\ncooling is present in the coronal loop systems. Indeed, in some cases the\noscillation amplitude can even increase through time. In this article, we\nanalyse a flare-driven coronal loop oscillation observed by the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) in order to investigate\nwhether models of cooling can explain the amplitude profile of the oscillation\nand whether hints of cooling can be found in the intensity evolution of several\nSDO/AIA filters. During the oscillation of this loop system, the kink mode\namplitude appears to differ from a typical Gaussian or exponential profile with\nsome hints being present that the amplitude increases. The application of\ncooling coronal loop modelling allowed us to estimate the density ratio between\nthe loop and the background plasma, with a ratio of between 2.05-2.35 being\nreturned. Overall, our results indicate that consideration of the thermal\nevolution of coronal loop systems can allow us to better describe oscillations\nin these structures and return more accurate estimates of the physical\nproperties of the loops (e.g., density, scale height, magnetic field strength).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 16:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

This is a challenging task, as the images to be\nmatched are generally semantically misaligned due to the diversity of human\nposes and capture viewpoints, incompleteness of the visible bodies (due to\nocclusion), etc. In this paper, we propose a framework that drives the reID\nnetwork to learn semantics-aligned feature representation through delicate\nsupervision designs. Specifically, we build a Semantics Aligning Network (SAN)\nwhich consists of a base network as encoder (SA-Enc) for re-ID, and a decoder\n(SA-Dec) for reconstructing/regressing the densely semantics aligned full\ntexture image. We jointly train the SAN under the supervisions of person\nre-identification and aligned texture generation. Moreover, at the decoder,\nbesides the reconstruction loss, we add Triplet ReID constraints over the\nfeature maps as the perceptual losses. The decoder is discarded in the\ninference and thus our scheme is computationally efficient. Ablation studies\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our design.

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to detect SSMVEP from\noccipital EEG, and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were used to\nidentify SMR in the EEG from the sensorimotor area. The results showed that the\nproposed visual gaiting stimulus-induced SSMVEP, with classification accuracies\nof 88.9 $\\pm$ 12.0% in a four-class scenario. More importantly, it induced\nclear and sustained event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS)\nin the EEG from the sensorimotor area, while no ERD/ERS in the sensorimotor\narea could be observed when the other two SSVEP stimuli were used. Further, for\nparticipants with sufficiently clear SSMVEP pattern (classification accuracy >\n85%), the ERD index values in mu-beta band induced by the proposed gaiting\nstimulus were statistically different from that of the other two types of\nstimulus. Therefore, a novel BCI based on the proposed stimulus has potential\nin neurorehabilitation applications because it simultaneously has the high\naccuracy of an SSMVEP (~90% accuracy in a four-class setup) and the ability to\nactivate sensorimotor cortex. And such potential will be further explored in\nfuture studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 16:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

The\nobserved difference in complexity between the two states of conscious arousal\nincreases as higher orders of temporal correlations are taken into account. We\nthen go on to show that, in addition to reducing complexity, anesthesia also\nmodulates the informational structure between the forward- and reverse-time\nneural signals. Specifically, using three distinct notions of temporal\nasymmetry we show that anesthesia reduces temporal asymmetry on\ninformation-theoretic and information-geometric grounds. In contrast to prior\nwork, our results show that: (1) Complexity differences can emerge at very\nshort timescales and across broad regions of the fly brain, thus heralding the\nmacroscopic state of anesthesia in a previously unforeseen manner, and (2) that\ngeneral anesthesia also modulates the temporal asymmetry of neural signals.\nTogether, our results demonstrate that anesthetized brains become both less\nstructured and more reversible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 16:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 06:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 01:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

This approach leads to a new deep\narchitecture, where networks are sampled from the posterior of local causal\nstructures, and coupled into a compact hierarchy. We demonstrate that sampling\nnetworks from this hierarchy, proportionally to their posterior, is efficient\nand enables estimating various types of uncertainties.

More specifically, the proposed machine learning\nmodel leverages the prior observations of the channel to achieve two\nobjectives. First, it optimizes the compressive channel sensing vectors based\non the surrounding environment in an unsupervised manner to focus the sensing\npower on the most promising spatial directions. This is enabled by a novel\nneural network architecture that accounts for the constraints on the RF chains\nand models the transmitter/receiver measurement matrices as two complex-valued\nconvolutional layers. Second, the proposed model learns how to construct the RF\nbeamforming vectors of the hybrid architectures directly from the projected\nchannel vector (the received sensing vector). The auto-precoder neural network\nthat incorporates both the channel sensing and beam prediction is trained\nend-to-end as a multi-task classification problem. Thanks to this design\nmethodology that leverages the prior channel observations and the implicit\nawareness about the surrounding environment/user distributions, the proposed\napproach significantly reduces the training overhead compared to classical\n(non-machine learning) solutions. For example, for a system of 64 transmit and\n64 receive antennas, with 3 RF chains at both sides, the proposed solution\nneeds only 8 or 16 channel training pilots to directly predict the RF\nbeamforming/combining vectors of the hybrid architectures and achieve\nnear-optimal achievable rates.

Traditionally, Lorentz reciprocity is broken by applying\nmagnetic bias to ferrite materials, therefore conventional circulators are\nbulky and expensive. In this paper, this problem is addressed by replacing the\nmagnetic bias with periodic spatiotemporal modulation. Compared to previous\nworks, the proposed circulator is constructed using surface acoustic wave (SAW)\nfilters instead of transmission lines (TL), which reduces the modulation\nfrequency by at least a factor of 20 and ensures ultra-low power consumption\nand high linearity. The miniaturized high quality (Q) factor SAW filters also\nlead to a low-loss non-reciprocal band with strong isolation (IX) and broad\nbandwidth (BW) on a chip scale, therefore addressing such limitations in\nprevious magnet-free demonstrations.

To capture the transport properties we have\nnot only used a variety of single-particle measures like inverse participation\nratio, and von Neumann entropy, but also many-particle measures such as\npersistent current and its variance, and many body entanglement entropy. The\nmany-particle measures are very sensitive to the sub-band structure of the\nspectrum. Even in the delocalized phase, surprisingly the entanglement entropy\nis substantially suppressed when the Fermi level is in the band gaps whereas\nthe persistent current is vanishingly small for the same locations of the Fermi\nlevel. The entanglement entropy seems to follow area-law exclusively for these\nspecial locations of Fermi level or filling fractions of free fermions. A study\nof the standard deviation of persistent current offers further distinguishing\nfeatures for the special fillings. In the delocalized phase, the standard\ndeviation vs. mean persistent current curves are discontinuous for the\nnon-special values of filling fractions and continuous (closed) for the special\nvalues of filling fractions whereas in the localized phase, these curves become\nstraight lines for both types of filling fractions.

Graph\nanonymization techniques aim to protect individual users in a graph, while\ngraph de-anonymization aims to re-identify users. The effectiveness of\nanonymization and de-anonymization algorithms is usually evaluated with privacy\nmetrics. However, it is unclear how strong existing privacy metrics are when\nthey are used in graph privacy. In this paper, we study 26 privacy metrics for\ngraph anonymization and de-anonymization and evaluate their strength in terms\nof three criteria: monotonicity indicates whether the metric indicates lower\nprivacy for stronger adversaries; for within-scenario comparisons, evenness\nindicates whether metric values are spread evenly; and for between-scenario\ncomparisons, shared value range indicates whether metrics use a consistent\nvalue range across scenarios. Our extensive experiments indicate that no single\nmetric fulfills all three criteria perfectly. We therefore use methods from\nmulti-criteria decision analysis to aggregate multiple metrics in a metrics\nsuite, and we show that these metrics suites improve monotonicity compared to\nthe best individual metric. This important result enables more monotonic, and\nthus more accurate, evaluations of new graph anonymization and de-anonymization\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 18:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

Modern machine\nlearning offers a way to extend PID controllers beyond their linear\ncapabilities by using neural networks.

In this\npaper, we examine the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent\nneural networks-namely, General Dynamic Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that\nGDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of control systems and\nhighlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for control\nsystems.

Although TTR\nspectra carry rich information about the systems under study, the response is\nencoded in a three-point correlation function comprising of both dipole and\npolarizability elements. Theoretical methods are necessary for the\ninterpretation of the experimental results. In this work, we study the\nliquid-phase dynamics of bromoform, a polarizable molecule with a strong TTR\nresponse. Previous work based on reduced density matrix (RDM) simulations\nsuggests that unusually large multi-quanta dipole matrix elements are needed to\nunderstand the measured spectrum of bromoform. Here, we demonstrate that a\nself-consistent definition of the time coordinates with respect to the\nreference pulse leads to a simplified experimental spectrum.

In this\npaper we will verify which properties coming from the topological entropy map\nare valid for both mean dimension and metric mean dimension. In particular, we\nwill prove that the metric mean dimension map is not continuous anywhere on the\nset consisting of continuous maps on both the Cantor set, the interval or the\ncircle. Finally we prove that the metric mean dimension on the set consisting\nof continuous map on the interval and on the circle is not lower\nsemi-continuous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 20:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 00:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

Basic\nobjects of free analysis are noncommutative functions. These are maps on tuples\nof matrices of all sizes that preserve direct sums and similarities.\n  This paper investigates the local theory of noncommutative functions. The\nfirst main result shows that for a scalar point $Y$, the ring $O_Y$ of\nuniformly analytic noncommutative germs about $Y$ is an integral domain and\nadmits a universal skew field of fractions, whose elements are called\nmeromorphic germs. A corollary is a local-global rank principle that connects\nranks of matrix evaluations of a matrix $A$ over $O_Y$ with the factorization\nof $A$ over $O_Y$. Different phenomena occur for a semisimple tuple of\nnon-scalar matrices $Y$. Here it is shown that $O_Y$ contains copies of the\nmatrix algebra generated by $Y$. In particular, there exist nonzero nilpotent\nuniformly analytic functions defined in a neighborhood of $Y$, and $O_Y$ does\nnot embed into a skew field. Nevertheless, the ring $O_Y$ is described as the\ncompletion of a free algebra with respect to the vanishing ideal at $Y$. This\nis a consequence of the second main result, a free Hermite interpolation\ntheorem: if $f$ is a noncommutative function, then for any finite set of\nsemisimple points and a natural number $L$ there exists a noncommutative\npolynomial that agrees with $f$ at the chosen points up to differentials of\norder $L$.

The ab initio prediction of singlet-triplet (ST) gaps\nis challenging due to the potentially biradical nature of the involved states,\ncombined with the potentially large size of relevant molecules. In this work,\nwe show that phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can\naccurately predict ST gaps for chemical systems with singlet states of highly\nbiradical nature, including a set of 13 small molecules and the ortho-, meta-,\nand para-isomers of benzyne.

We proceed to show that this scalable methodology is capable of\nyielding accurate ST gaps for all linear polyacenes for which experimental\nmeasurements exist, i.e. naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene.

We search for this signature of\nmodified gravity in the SPARC sample of measured rotation curves, using an MCMC\ntechnique to derive constraints on $f_{R0}$. Assuming NFW dark matter haloes\nand with $f_{R0}$ freely varying for each galaxy, most galaxies prefer $f(R)$\ngravity to $\\Lambda$CDM, but there is a large spread of inferred $f_{R0}$\nvalues, inconsistent with a single global value.

However, this signal is largely a result of galaxies for which the $f(R)$\nsignal is degenerate with the core/cusp problem, and when the NFW profile is\nreplaced with a cored halo profile, $\\Lambda$CDM gives better fits than any\ngiven $f(R)$ model.

Developers must manually\nsearch through thousands of model-variants -- versions of already-trained\nmodels that differ in hardware, resource footprints, latencies, costs, and\naccuracies -- to meet the diverse application requirements. Since requirements,\nquery load, and applications themselves evolve over time, these decisions need\nto be made dynamically for each inference query to avoid excessive costs\nthrough naive autoscaling. To avoid navigating through the large and complex\ntrade-off space of model-variants, developers often fix a variant across\nqueries, and replicate it when load increases. However, given the diversity\nacross variants and hardware platforms in the cloud, a lack of understanding of\nthe trade-off space can incur significant costs to developers.\n  This paper introduces INFaaS, a managed and model-less system for distributed\ninference serving, where developers simply specify the performance and accuracy\nrequirements for their applications without needing to specify a specific\nmodel-variant for each query. INFaaS generates model-variants, and efficiently\nnavigates the large trade-off space of model-variants on behalf of developers\nto meet application-specific objectives: (a) for each query, it selects a\nmodel, hardware architecture, and model optimizations, (b) it combines VM-level\nhorizontal autoscaling with model-level autoscaling, where multiple, different\nmodel-variants are used to serve queries within each machine. By leveraging\ndiverse variants and sharing hardware resources across models, INFaaS achieves\n1.3x higher throughput, violates latency objectives 1.6x less often, and saves\nup to 21.6x in cost (8.5x on average) compared to state-of-the-art inference\nserving systems on AWS EC2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 23:08:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 15:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 04:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 22:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 21:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In this\nwork, we construct a chemical evolution model to investigate the origin of the\nMZR, including both the effects of gas inflows and outflows in galaxies.

The range of the MZRs produced by our models is in a narrow space,\nwhich provides support to the universality of the MZRs.

In the absence of driving, it is known that solutions\nto the standard CH equation are characterized by an initial stage of phase\nseparation into regions of one phase surrounded by the other phase (i.e.,\nclusters or drops/holes or islands are obtained) followed by the coarsening\nprocess, where the average size of the structures grows in time and their\nnumber decreases. Moreover, two main coarsening modes have been identified in\nthe literature, namely, coarsening due to volume transfer and due to\ntranslation. In the opposite limit of strong driving, the well-known\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation is recovered, which may produce complicated\nchaotic spatio-temporal oscillations. The primary aim of the present work is to\nperform a detailed and systematic investigation of the transitions in the\nsolutions of the convective CH (cCH) equation for a wide range of parameter\nvalues, and, in particular, to understand in detail how the coarsening dynamics\nis affected by an increase of the strength of the lateral driving force.\nConsidering symmetric two-drop states, we find that one of the coarsening modes\nis stabilized at relatively weak driving, and the type of the remaining mode\nmay change as driving increases. Furthermore, there exist intervals in the\ndriving strength where coarsening is completely stabilized. In the intervals\nwhere the symmetric two-drop states are unstable they can evolve, for example,\ninto one-drop states, two-drop states of broken symmetry or even time-periodic\ntwo-drop states that consist of two traveling drops that periodically exchange\nmass.

We assume that the source periodically\ntransmits RF signals to nearby wireless access points. Received signal strength\n(RSS) at the UAV, which is a function of the UAV and source positions, is fed\nto a Q-learning algorithm and the UAV is navigated to the vicinity of the\nsource. Unlike the traditional location-based Q-learning approach that uses the\nGPS coordinates of the agent, our method uses the RSS to define the states and\nrewards of the algorithm. It does not require any a priori information about\nthe environment. These, in turn, make it possible to use the UAVs in indoor SAR\noperations. Two indoor scenarios with different dimensions are created using a\nray tracing software. Then, the corresponding heat maps that show the RSS at\neach possible UAV location are extracted for more realistic analysis.\nPerformance of the RSS-based Q-learning algorithm is compared with the baseline\n(location-based) Q-learning algorithm in terms of convergence speed, average\nnumber of steps per episode, and the total length of the final trajectory.

Semiotic communication is defined, in this study, as the\ngeneration and interpretation of signs associated with the categories formed\nthrough the agent's own sensory experience or by exchange of signs with other\nagents. From the viewpoint of language evolution and symbol emergence,\norganization of a symbol system in a multi-agent system is considered as a\nbottom-up and dynamic process, where individual agents share the meaning of\nsigns and categorize sensory experience. A constructive computational model can\nexplain the mutual dependency of the two processes and has mathematical support\nthat guarantees a symbol system's emergence and sharing within the multi-agent\nsystem. In this paper, we describe a new computational model that represents\nsymbol emergence in a two-agent system based on a probabilistic generative\nmodel for multimodal categorization. It models semiotic communication via a\nprobabilistic rejection based on the receiver's own belief. We have found that\nthe dynamics by which cognitively independent agents create a symbol system\nthrough their semiotic communication can be regarded as the inference process\nof a hidden variable in an interpersonal multimodal categorizer, if we define\nthe rejection probability based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The\nvalidity of the proposed model and algorithm for symbol emergence is also\nverified in an experiment with two agents observing daily objects in the\nreal-world environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our model\nreproduces the phenomena of symbol emergence, which does not require a teacher\nwho would know a pre-existing symbol system. Instead, the multi-agent system\ncan form and use a symbol system without having pre-existing categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 07:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}

Large objects have a slope $\\alpha_{big} = 0.72 \\pm 0.09 (stat.) \\pm\n0.15 (sys.)$ while small objects behave as $\\alpha_{small} = 0.07 \\pm 0.03\n(stat.) \\pm 0.09 (sys.)$ where the SFD is $\\propto 10^{\\alpha H_N}$ and $H_N$\nrepresents the cometary nuclear absolute magnitude. The total number of LPCs\nthat are $>1$~km diameter and have perihelia $q<10$~au is $0.46 \\pm 0.15 \\times\n10^9$ while there are only $2.4 \\pm 0.5 (stat.) \\pm 2 (sys.) \\times 10^9$\nobjects with diameters $>100$~m due to the shallow slope of the SFD for\ndiameters $<1$~m.

Style transfer provides a defence. Current techniques\ntypically use either encoder-decoder architectures or rule-based algorithms.\nCrucially, style transfer must reliably retain original semantic content to be\nactually deployable. We conduct a multifaceted evaluation of three\nstate-of-the-art encoder-decoder style transfer techniques, and show that all\nfail at semantic retainment. In particular, they do not produce appropriate\nparaphrases, but only retain original content in the trivial case of exactly\nreproducing the text. To mitigate this problem we propose ParChoice: a\ntechnique based on the combinatorial application of multiple paraphrasing\nalgorithms. ParChoice strongly outperforms the encoder-decoder baselines in\nsemantic retainment. Additionally, compared to baselines that achieve\nnon-negligible semantic retainment, ParChoice has superior style transfer\nperformance. We also apply ParChoice to multi-author style imitation (not\nconsidered by prior work), where we achieve up to 75% imitation success among\nfive authors. Furthermore, when compared to two state-of-the-art rule-based\nstyle transfer techniques, ParChoice has markedly better semantic retainment.\nCombining ParChoice with the best performing rule-based baseline (Mutant-X)\nalso reaches the highest style transfer success on the Brennan-Greenstadt and\nExtended-Brennan-Greenstadt corpora, with much less impact on original meaning\nthan when using the rule-based baseline techniques alone. Finally, we highlight\na critical problem that afflicts all current style transfer techniques: the\nadversary can use the same technique for thwarting style transfer via\nadversarial training.

Although many recent advances\nin this problem are found in both unsupervised and supervised learning\napproaches, the performances of most of these approaches are greatly affected\nby insufficient diversities and richness of training data. To alleviate this\nissue, we propose an unsupervised learning approach, which is capable of\nestimating various complex poses well under limited available training data.\nSpecifically, we propose a Shape Decomposition Model (SDM) in which a 3D pose\nis considered as the superposition of two parts which are global structure\ntogether with some deformations. Based on SDM, we estimate these two parts\nexplicitly by solving two sets of different distributed combination\ncoefficients of geometric priors.

Quantitative evaluations\non several widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach yields better\nperformances over other competitive approaches.

An abnormal response of polymer brushes, so-called co-nonsolvency, is\nthe phenomenon where the brush counter-intuitively collapses in a good solvent\nmixture. In this work, we employed molecular dynamics simulations to\ninvestigate the structural properties of the grafted polymers on the occurrence\nof co-nonsolvency. Brushes with various grafting densities were considered to\nstudy the effect of topological excluded volumes on the co-nonsolvency. We\nfound that the brush height follows a novel scaling behavior of the grafting\ndensity $h \\sim \\sigma_{\\text g}^{0.71}$ in the co-nonsolvent mixture. Using\nthe scaling exponent and Alexander-de Gennes theory, an analytic function that\npredicts the monomer density was obtained. The many-chain effects in the\nco-nonsolvent lead to the formation of both intermolecular and intramolecular\nbridging structures. Increasing the grafting density entails lower looping\nevents occuring because of the intermolcular bridging, causing diverse\nstructural properties. We report how the average thickness, the polymer\norientation, and the looping probability varies as the grafting density\nincreases. Based on these observations, we constructed a phase diagram of the\npolymer brush system using the average thickness and orientation as order\nparameters.

Dependencies introduce bias --- Accumulation Bias --- and invalidate\nthe sampling distribution assumed for p-value tests, thus inflating type-I\nerrors. But dependencies are also inevitable, since for science to accumulate\nefficiently, new research needs to be informed by past results. Here, we\ninvestigate various ways in which time influences error control in\nmeta-analysis testing. We introduce an Accumulation Bias Framework that allows\nus to model a wide variety of practically occurring dependencies, including\nstudy series accumulation, meta-analysis timing, and approaches to multiple\ntesting in living systematic reviews. The strength of this framework is that it\nshows how all dependencies affect p-value-based tests in a similar manner. This\nleads to two main conclusions. First, Accumulation Bias is inevitable, and even\nif it can be approximated and accounted for, no valid p-value tests can be\nconstructed. Second, tests based on likelihood ratios withstand Accumulation\nBias: they provide bounds on error probabilities that remain valid despite the\nbias. We leave the reader with a choice between two proposals to consider time\nin error control: either treat individual (primary) studies and meta-analyses\nas two separate worlds --- each with their own timing --- or integrate\nindividual studies in the meta-analysis world. Taking up likelihood ratios in\neither approach allows for valid tests that relate well to the accumulating\nnature of scientific knowledge. Likelihood ratios can be interpreted as betting\nprofits, earned in previous studies and invested in new ones, while the\nmeta-analyst is allowed to cash out at any time and advise against future\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 10:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

In addition, new phenomena such as the magnetic spin Hall effect\nwere experimentally observed in non-collinear AFMs, and the presence of the\nequivalent to the ferromagnetic spin transfer torque via spin polarized\ncurrents was theoretically predicted. In spite of these developments, an\ninterpretation of the rich physical phenomena observed in non-collinear\nantiferromagnets is challenging, since the microscopic spin arrangement, the\nmagnetic domain distribution, and the domain orientations have proven\nnotoriously difficult to access experimentally.

Since luminosities of radio AGN are\nsensitive to halo densities, any significant transition would be expected to\nshow up in the radio luminosities of large samples of galaxies. The Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR) Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) has indeed identified a\ngalaxy stellar mass scale, $10^{11} M_\\odot$ , above which the radio\nluminosities increase disproportionately. Here, we investigate, if radio\nluminosities of galaxies, especially the marked rise at galaxy masses around\n$10^{11} M_\\odot$, can be explained with standard assumptions on jet powers,\nscaling between black hole-mass and galaxy mass and gaseous halos. We developed\nmodels for the radio luminosity of radio AGN in halos under infall, galactic\nwind and hydrostatic conditions based on observational data and theoretical\nconstraints, and compared it to LoTSS data for a large sample of galaxies in\nthe mass rangebetween $10^{8.5} M_\\odot$ and $10^{12} M_\\odot$.

The marked rise in radio luminosity at $10^{11} M_\\odot$ is\nmatched in our model, and is related to significant change in halo gas density\naround this galaxy mass, which is a consequence of the lower cooling rates at\nhigher virial temperature.

We work in an open system\nframework, where the field plays the role of an environment for the detector.\nThe long-time interaction between the detector and the field is modelled with\nthe aid of a one-parameter family of switching functions that turn on and off\nthe interaction Hamiltonian between the two subsystems, such that the long-time\ninteraction limit is reached as the family parameter goes to infinity. In such\nlimit, we show that if the field is in a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and\nthe detector is stationary with respect to the notion of positive frequency of\nthe field, in the Born-Markov approximation, the asymptotic state of the\ndetector is a Gibbs state at the KMS temperature. We then relax the KMS\ncondition for the field state, and require only that a frequency-dependent\nversion of the detailed balance condition for the Wightman function pulled back\nto the detector worldline hold, in the sense that the inverse temperature\nappearing in the detailed balance relation need not be constant. In this\nsetting, we show that the late-time asymptotic state of the detector has the\nform of a thermal density matrix, but with a frequency-dependent temperature.\nWe present examples of these results, which include the classical Unruh effect\nand idealised Hawking radiation (for fields in the HHI state), and also the\nstudy of the late-time behaviour of detectors following stationary \"cusped\" and\ncircular motions in Minkowski space interacting with a massless Klein-Gordon\nfield in the Minkowski vacuum.

Moreover, contrary to the 'standard'\nform of thermal photon propagator, the Hadamard expression has a well defined\nanalytical properties.

Claims of an X-shaped Galactic bulge were based on the assumption of\nred clump stars as standard candles in some lines of sight crossing the\noff-plane bulge.

Convergent RNNs can also be trained with the more conventional\nBackpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. In its original formulation EP\nwas described in the case of real-time neuronal dynamics, which is\ncomputationally costly.

But these approximations incur a\nrunning time roughly cubic in dimension -- and we show that, besides\ncomputational issues, their accuracy dramatically deteriorates in high\ndimensions. Authors have suggested many potential and seemingly intuitive\nsolutions, but these methods have not yet been systematically evaluated or\ncompared. We find that all but one perform so poorly as to be unusable for\napproximating LOOCV. Crucially, though, we are able to show, both empirically\nand theoretically, that one approximation can perform well in high dimensions\n-- in cases where the high-dimensional parameter exhibits sparsity. Under\ninterpretable assumptions, our theory demonstrates that the problem can be\nreduced to working within an empirically recovered (small) support. This\nprocedure is straightforward to implement, and we prove that its running time\nand error depend on the (small) support size even when the full parameter\ndimension is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 14:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 18:25:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 19:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 23:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In this\narticle I propose a computational framework that characterises awareness\nreports as metacognitive decisions (inference) about a generative model of\nperceptual content. This account is motivated from the perspective of how\nflexible hierarchical state spaces are built during learning and\ndecision-making. Internal states supporting awareness reports, unlike those\ncovarying with perceptual contents, are simple and abstract, varying along a\none-dimensional continuum from absent to present. A critical feature of this\narchitecture is that it is both higher-order and asymmetric: a vast number of\nperceptual states is nested under \"present\", but a much smaller number of\npossible states nested under \"absent\". Via simulations I show that this\nasymmetry provides a natural account of observations of \"global ignition\" in\nbrain imaging studies of awareness reports.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 10:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 13:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 11:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

A significant obstacle to current trend analyses is the\ndevelopment of a numerically stable and efficiency-finite element scheme that\nperforms well at low frequency and does not require a large number of degrees\nof freedom. Here, a custom finite element method (FEM) solver based on edge\nelements is proposed using the weakly coupled theory, which separates the\nsolution into two steps. First, the background field (the magnetic vector\npotential on each edge) is calculated and stored. Then, the electric scalar\npotential on each node is obtained by FEM based on Galerkin formulations.\nConsequently, the electric field and eddy current distribution in the object\ncan be obtained. This solver is more efficient than typical commercial solvers\nsince it reduces the vector eddy current equation to a scalar one, and reduces\nthe meshing domain to just the eddy current region. It can therefore tackle\ncomplex eddy current calculations for models with much larger numbers of\nelements, such as those encountered in eddy current computation in biological\ntissues. An example is presented with a realistic human brain mesh of 2 million\nelements. In addition, with this solver, the equivalent magnetic field induced\nfrom the excitation coil is applied, and therefore there is no need to mesh the\nexcitation coil. In combination, these significantly increase the efficiency of\nthe solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 21:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

The\nproposed approach is consisted of low-level SVR models for the input parameters\nof larger sample sizes and high-level SVR model for the input parameters of\nsmaller sample sizes. For each training point of the input parameters of\nsmaller sample sizes, one low-level SVR model is built based on its\ncorresponding input parameters of larger sample sizes and their responses of\ninterest.

Brain cognitive\nfunctions are the mental processes that allow us to receive, select, store,\ntransform, develop, and recover information that we've received from external\nstimuli. This process allows us to understand and to relate to the world more\neffectively. Cognitive functions are brain-based skills we need to carry out\nany task from the simplest to the most complex. They are related with the\nmechanisms of how we learn, remember, problem-solve, and pay attention, etc. To\nbe more specific, in this paper, we will talk about the perception, attention\nand memory functions of the human brain. Several other brain cognitive\nfunctions, e.g., arousal, decision making, natural language, motor\ncoordination, planning, problem solving and thinking, will be added to this\npaper in the later versions, respectively. Many of the materials used in this\npaper are from wikipedia and several other neuroscience introductory articles,\nwhich will be properly cited in this paper. This is the last of the three\ntutorial articles about the brain. The readers are suggested to read this paper\nafter the previous two tutorial articles on brain structure and functions [17]\nas well as the brain basic neural units [16].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 23:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}
