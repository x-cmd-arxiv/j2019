While an\noverarching principle specifying the precise microscopic coupling scenarios for\nwhich quantum spin-liquid behavior arises is unknown, it is well-established\nthat they are preferably found in spin systems where the corresponding\nclassical limit of spin magnitudes $S\\rightarrow\\infty$ exhibits a macroscopic\nground state degeneracy, so-called classical spin liquids. Spiral spin liquids\nrepresent a special family of classical spin liquids where degenerate manifolds\nof spin spirals form closed contours or surfaces in momentum space. Here, we\ninvestigate the potential of spiral spin liquids to evoke quantum spin-liquid\nbehavior when the spin magnitude is tuned from the classical\n$S\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit to the quantum $S=1/2$ case. To this end, we first\nuse the Luttinger-Tisza method to formulate a general scheme which allows one\nto construct new spiral spin liquids based on bipartite lattices. We apply this\napproach to the two-dimensional square lattice and the three-dimensional hcp\nlattice to design classical spiral spin-liquid phases which have not been\npreviously studied. By employing the pseudofermion functional renormalization\ngroup (PFFRG) technique we investigate the effects of quantum fluctuations when\nthe classical spins are replaced by quantum $S=1/2$ spins. We indeed find that\nextended spiral spin-liquid regimes change into paramagnetic quantum phases\npossibly realizing quantum spin liquids. Remnants of the degenerate spiral\nsurfaces are still discernible in the momentum-resolved susceptibility, even in\nthe quantum $S=1/2$ case. In total, this corroborates the potential of\nclassical spiral spin liquids to induce more complex non-magnetic quantum\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 16:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Here, the resonant $k_{\\mathrm{res}}$ satisfies the class 3 triad\nresonance condition among two short-mode waves and one long-mode wave in which\nall waves propagate in the same direction. Moreover, when the slope of the\nbaroclinic flow is sufficiently small, only one spatially-localized\nlarge-amplitude surface wave packet can be generated at the leading edge. This\nlocalized surface wave packet becomes high in amplitude and large in group\nvelocity after the interaction with its surrounding waves. These results are\nqualitatively consistent with various experimental observations including\nresonant surface waves at the leading edge of an internal wave. Subsequently,\nwe propose a mechanism, referred to as the modulation-resonance mechanism,\nunderlying these surface phenomena, based on our numerical simulations. The\nproposed modulation-resonance mechanism combines the linear modulation\n(ray-based) theory for the spatiotemporal asymmetric behavior of surface waves\nand the nonlinear class 3 triad resonance theory for the energy focusing of\nsurface waves around the resonant wavenumber $k_{\\mathrm{res}}$ in Fourier\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 17:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Numerical simulations have proposed a mechanism of shell formation\nthrough phase wrapping during a radial minor merger. Alternatively, there could\nbe barely a space wrapping, when particles have not made any radial oscillation\nyet, but are bound by their radial expansion, or produce an edge-brightened\nfeature. These can be distinguished, because they are expected to keep a high\nradial velocity.

Some of the gas,\nthe most diffuse and dissipative, is expected to be driven quickly to the\ncenter if it is travelling on nearly radial orbits.

The STS model can run at 35 FPS on a high-end desktop, but its\naccuracy is significantly worse than that of offline state-of-the-art methods.\nWe leverage recent advances in the design and training of deep instance\nsegmentation models to improve the performance accuracy of the STS model whilst\nkeeping its real-time capabilities intact.

The core idea is to incorporate the conflict resolution process\nwithin the channel by introducing a rational committee of external parties,\ncalled Wardens. Hence, if a party wants to close a channel unilaterally, it can\nonly get the committee's approval for the last valid state. Brick provides\nsub-second latency because it does not employ heavy-weight consensus.

We\nstudy the dynamics of the inflaton and gauge fields in terms of the two\neffective coupling parameters: the gauge coupling and the axion decay constant.\nStarting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the far past, we find that the\nnon-trivial gauge field background arises only significantly after the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) scales have left the horizon.

In the \"bulk-surface regime\", for highly-doped samples, the\ndominant contribution to the conductance is quadratic in the chemical\npotential, and mostly conditioned by the bulk states; the flux dependence shows\nclearly that both the surface and the bulk states contribute. The two\naforementioned regimes prove that the contribution of the Fermi-arc surface\nstates is salient and, therefore, crucial for understanding transport\nproperties of finite-size Weyl semimetal systems. Last but not least, we\ndemonstrate that both regimes are robust to disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

In this paper, we analyze, using detailed numerical simulations,\nthe mean motion histories of the three planets that are thought to lie within\nor close to the habitable zone of the system: planets d, e, and f. We\ndemonstrate that, depending on the strength of the mutual interactions within\nthe system, these planets can be pushed into spin states which are effectively\nnon-synchronous. We find that it can produce significant libration of the spin\nstate, if not complete circulation in the frame co-rotating with the orbit. We\nalso show that these spin states are likely to be unable to sustain long-term\nstability, with many of our simulations suggesting that the spin evolves, under\nthe influence of tidal synchronization forces, into quasi-stable attractor\nstates, which last on timescales of thousands of years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 18:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Whereas there are some\nsatisfactory answers to the problems of approximation and optimization, much\nless is known about the theory of generalization. Most existing theoretical\nworks for generalization fail to explain the performance of neural networks in\npractice. To derive a meaningful bound, we study the generalization error of\nneural networks for classification problems in terms of data distribution and\nneural network smoothness. We introduce the cover complexity (CC) to measure\nthe difficulty of learning a data set and the inverse of the modulus of\ncontinuity to quantify neural network smoothness. A quantitative bound for\nexpected accuracy/error is derived by considering both the CC and neural\nnetwork smoothness. Although most of the analysis is general and not specific\nto neural networks, we validate our theoretical assumptions and results\nnumerically for neural networks by several data sets of images. The numerical\nresults confirm that the expected error of trained networks scaled with the\nsquare root of the number of classes has a linear relationship with respect to\nthe CC.

In this paper, we study the possibility of transforming a deep neural\nnetwork to another network with a different number of units or layers, which\ncan be either equivalent, a local exact approximation, or a global linear\napproximation of the original network. On the practical side, we show that\ncertain rectified linear units (ReLUs) can be safely removed from a network if\nthey are always active or inactive for any valid input. If we only need an\nequivalent network for a smaller domain, then more units can be removed and\nsome layers collapsed. On the theoretical side, we constructively show that for\nany feed-forward ReLU network, there exists a global linear approximation to a\n2-hidden-layer shallow network with a fixed number of units. This result is a\nbalance between the increasing number of units for arbitrary approximation with\na single layer and the known upper bound of $\\lceil log(n_0+1)\\rceil +1$ layers\nfor exact representation, where $n_0$ is the input dimension. While the\ntransformed network may require an exponential number of units to capture the\nactivation patterns of the original network, we show that it can be made\nsubstantially smaller by only accounting for the patterns that define linear\nregions. Based on experiments with ReLU networks on the MNIST dataset, we found\nthat $l_1$-regularization and adversarial training reduces the number of linear\nregions significantly as the number of stable units increases due to weight\nsparsity. Therefore, we can also intentionally train ReLU networks to allow for\neffective loss-less compression and approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 18:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

In this work, we show that the state\nestimates from the KF in a standard linear dynamical system setting are\nequivalent to those given by the KF in a transformed system, with infinite\nprocess noise (i.e., a \"flat prior\") and an augmented measurement space. This\nreformulation -- which we refer to as augmented measurement sensor fusion (SF)\n-- is conceptually interesting, because the transformed system here is\nseemingly static (as there is effectively no process model), but we can still\ncapture the state dynamics inherent to the KF by folding the process model into\nthe measurement space. Further, this reformulation of the KF turns out to be\nuseful in settings in which past states are observed eventually (at some lag).\nHere, when the measurement noise covariance is estimated by the empirical\ncovariance, we show that the state predictions from SF are equivalent to those\nfrom a regression of past states on past measurements, subject to particular\nlinear constraints (reflecting the relationships encoded in the measurement\nmap). This allows us to port standard ideas (say, regularization methods) in\nregression over to dynamical systems. For example, we can posit multiple\ncandidate process models, fold all of them into the measurement model,\ntransform to the regression perspective, and apply $\\ell_1$ penalization to\nperform process model selection. We give various empirical demonstrations, and\nfocus on an application to nowcasting the weekly incidence of influenza in the\nUS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 18:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 13:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 01:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

XLDA enhances performance of all 14 tested\nlanguages of the cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) benchmark.\nWith improvements of up to $4.8\\%$, training with XLDA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for Greek, Turkish, and Urdu.

With the rapid development of pattern recognition techniques, automated\nfingerprint identification systems (AFIS) have become more and more ubiquitous.\nHowever, most AFIS are utilized for live-scan or rolled/slap prints while only\na few systems can work on latent fingerprints with reasonable accuracy. The\nquestion of whether taking higher resolution scans of latent fingerprints and\ntheir rolled/slap mate prints could help improve the identification accuracy\nstill remains an open question in the forensic community. Because pores are one\nof the most reliable features besides minutiae to identify latent fingerprints,\nwe propose an end-to-end automatic pore extraction and matching system to\nanalyze the utility of pores in latent fingerprint identification. Hence, this\npaper answers two questions in the latent fingerprint domain: (i) does the\nincorporation of pores as level-3 features improve the system performance\nsignificantly? and (ii) does the 1,000 ppi image resolution improve the\nrecognition results? We believe that our proposed end-to-end pore extraction\nand matching system will be a concrete baseline for future latent AFIS\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 19:44:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 02:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

A natural loss\nfunction in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions induced\nby the predicted parameters, in contrast to the prediction error of the\nparameters. This loss function was recently introduced in Elmachtoub and Grigas\n(2022) and referred to as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss.

Since the SPO loss is non-convex and non-Lipschitz, standard results for\nderiving generalization bounds do not apply.\n  We first derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of\na polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of\nextreme points, but, in the case of a general convex feasible region, have\nlinear dependence on the decision dimension. By exploiting the structure of the\nSPO loss function and a key property of the feasible region, which we denote as\nthe strength property, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the\ndecision and feature dimensions. Our approach and analysis rely on placing a\nmargin around problematic predictions that do not yield unique optimal\nsolutions, and then providing generalization bounds in the context of a\nmodified margin SPO loss function that is Lipschitz continuous.

This technique allows us to extract\nthe non-Gaussianities identified in the multiscaled PDFs usually associated\nwith turbulence intermittency and to spatially reconstruct the Gaussian and the\nnon-Gaussian component of the map. This new technique can be applied on any\ndata set. Here, it is applied on a Herschel column density map of the Polaris\nflare cloud. The first component has by construction a self-similar fractal\ngeometry as the one produced by fractional Brownian motion simulations. The\nsecond component is called the coherent component, by opposition to fractal,\nand includes a network of filamentary structures which demonstrates a spatial\nhierarchical scaling, i.e. filaments inside filaments. The power spectrum\nanalysis of both components proves that the Fourier power spectrum of the\ninitial map is dominated by the power of the coherent filamentary structures\nacross almost all spatial scales. The coherent structures contribute\nprogressively, more and more from large to smaller scales, without producing\nany break in the inertial range. We suggest that this behaviour is induced, at\nleast partly, by inertial-range intermittency, a well known phenomenon for\nturbulent flows.

We show that, for certain choices of\nunderlying bundle, such moduli spaces decompose as a product of cyclic quiver\nvarieties in which each node is a line bundle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 21:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 15:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

It is adaptive in that it neither\nestimates nor requires a model of the human's action policy, or the internal\ndynamics of the plant, and can adjust to changes in both.

ADDL seamlessly integrates\nthe analysis discriminative dictionary learning, analysis representation and\nanalysis classifier training into a unified model. The applied analysis\nmechanism can make sure that the learnt dictionaries, representations and\nlinear classifiers over different classes are independent and discriminating as\nmuch as possible. The dictionary is obtained by minimizing a reconstruction\nerror and an analytical incoherence promoting term that encourages the\nsub-dictionaries associated with different classes to be independent. To obtain\nthe representation coefficients, ADDL imposes a sparse l2,1-norm constraint on\nthe coding coefficients instead of using l0 or l1-norm, since the l0 or l1-norm\nconstraint applied in most existing DL criteria makes the training phase time\nconsuming. The codes-extraction projection that bridges data with the sparse\ncodes by extracting special features from the given samples is calculated via\nminimizing a sparse codes approximation term.

An example of this occurs in\ndistributed Newton's method, where we wish to compute (or implicitly work with)\nthe inverse Hessian multiplied by the gradient. In this case, locally computed\nestimates are biased, and so taking a uniform average will not recover the\ncorrect solution. To address this, we propose determinantal averaging, a new\napproach for correcting the inversion bias. This approach involves reweighting\nthe local estimates of the Newton's step proportionally to the determinant of\nthe local Hessian estimate, and then averaging them together to obtain an\nimproved global estimate. This method provides the first known distributed\nNewton step that is asymptotically consistent, i.e., it recovers the exact step\nin the limit as the number of distributed partitions grows to infinity. To show\nthis, we develop new expectation identities and moment bounds for the\ndeterminant and adjugate of a random matrix. Determinantal averaging can be\napplied not only to Newton's method, but to computing any quantity that is a\nlinear tranformation of a matrix inverse, e.g., taking a trace of the inverse\ncovariance matrix, which is used in data uncertainty quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 00:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

We found that the proposed encoding method offers automatic\nextraction of speech content from speaker style, and is sufficient to cover\nfull linguistic content in a given language. Therefore, the TTS-Decoder can\nsynthesize speech with the same content as the input of ASR-Encoder but with\ndifferent speaker characteristics, which achieves voice conversion (VC). We\nfurther improve the quality of VC using adversarial training, where we train a\nTTS-Patcher that augments the output of TTS-Decoder. Objective and subjective\nevaluations show that the proposed approach offers strong VC results as it\neliminates speaker identity while preserving content within speech. In the\nZeroSpeech 2019 Challenge, we achieved outstanding performance in terms of low\nbitrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 01:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 09:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 16:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

In particular,\ndeep neural nets (DNNs) seem to be susceptible to small imperceptible changes\nover test instances. However, the line of work in provable robustness, so far,\nhas been focused on information-theoretic robustness, ruling out even the\nexistence of any adversarial examples. In this work, we study whether there is\na hope to benefit from algorithmic nature of an attacker that searches for\nadversarial examples, and ask whether there is any learning task for which it\nis possible to design classifiers that are only robust against polynomial-time\nadversaries. Indeed, numerous cryptographic tasks can only be secure against\ncomputationally bounded adversaries, and are indeed impossible for\ncomputationally unbounded attackers. Thus, it is natural to ask if the same\nstrategy could help robust learning.\n  We show that computational limitation of attackers can indeed be useful in\nrobust learning by demonstrating the possibility of a classifier for some\nlearning task for which computational and information theoretic adversaries of\nbounded perturbations have very different power. Namely, while computationally\nunbounded adversaries can attack successfully and find adversarial examples\nwith small perturbation, polynomial time adversaries are unable to do so unless\nthey can break standard cryptographic hardness assumptions. Our results,\ntherefore, indicate that perhaps a similar approach to cryptography (relying on\ncomputational hardness) holds promise for achieving computationally robust\nmachine learning.

The following basic local splitting problem, which is known as the\n\\emph{weak splitting} problem takes a central role in this context: Each node\nof a graph $G=(V,E)$ has to be colored red or blue such that each node of\nsufficiently large degree has at least one node of each color among its\nneighbors.

The goal\nof semi-supervised learning is to leverage ubiquitous unlabelled data, together\nwith small quantities of labelled data, to achieve high task performance.\nThough substantial recent progress has been made in developing semi-supervised\nalgorithms that are effective for comparatively small datasets, many of these\ntechniques do not scale readily to the large (unlaballed) datasets\ncharacteristic of real-world applications. In this paper we introduce a novel\napproach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation\n(LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP\nfirst embeds datapoints, labelled and otherwise, in a common latent space using\na deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown\ndatapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding,\ntaking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a\nweighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are\nthen trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance\nas well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label\ngroup, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label\npropagation.

The distillable distinguishability is the optimal rate at\nwhich a quantum box consisting of independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) states can be converted to bits of asymmetric distinguishability, and\nthe distinguishability cost is the optimal rate for the reverse transformation.\nBoth of these quantities are equal to the quantum relative entropy. The exact\none-shot distillable distinguishability is equal to the min-relative entropy,\nand the exact one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the max-relative\nentropy. Generalizing these results, the approximate one-shot distillable\ndistinguishability is equal to the smooth min-relative entropy, and the\napproximate one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the smooth\nmax-relative entropy. As a notable application of the former results, we prove\nthat the optimal rate of asymptotic conversion from a pair of i.i.d. quantum\nstates to another pair of i.i.d. quantum states is fully characterized by the\nratio of their quantum relative entropies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 06:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 01:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

In this paper\nwe investigate the effects of baryons on the number of weak-lensing peaks in\nthe convergence field. Our analysis is based on full-sky convergence maps\nconstructed via light-cones from $N$-body simulations, and we rely on the\nbaryonic correction model of Schneider et al. (2019) to model the baryonic\neffects on the density field. As a result we find that the baryonic effects\nstrongly depend on the Gaussian smoothing applied to the convergence map. For a\nDES-like survey setup, a smoothing of $\\theta_k\\gtrsim8$ arcmin is sufficient\nto keep the baryon signal below the expected statistical error. Smaller\nsmoothing scales lead to a significant suppression of high peaks (with\nsignal-to-noise above 2), while lower peaks are not affected. The situation is\nmore severe for a Euclid-like setup, where a smoothing of $\\theta_k\\gtrsim16$\narcmin is required to keep the baryonic suppression signal below the\nstatistical error. Smaller smoothing scales require a full modelling of\nbaryonic effects since both low and high peaks are strongly affected by\nbaryonic feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 06:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 07:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Since the jet problem is rather complicated, we\nfocus instead on the simpler problem of cylindrical rotation and axial magnetic\nfield, which shares significant similarity with the jet problem, and consider\nonly axisymmetric perturbations. The studied equilibrium configurations involve\na cylindrical interface and they are stable to non-magnetic centrifugal and\nmagneto-rotational instabilities everywhere except this interface.

Existing approaches have only focused on learning feature\nvectors for the nodes in a (knowledge) graph. To the best of our knowledge,\nnone of them has tackled the problem of embedding of graph edges, that is,\nknowledge graph triples. The approaches that are closer to this task have\nfocused on homogeneous graphs involving only one type of edge and obtain edge\nembeddings by applying some operation (e.g., average) on the embeddings of the\nendpoint nodes. The goal of this paper is to introduce Triple2Vec, a new\ntechnique to directly embed edges in (knowledge) graphs. Trple2Vec builds upon\nthree main ingredients. The first is the notion of line graph. The line graph\nof a graph is another graph representing the adjacency between edges of the\noriginal graph. In particular, the nodes of the line graph are the edges of the\noriginal graph. We show that directly applying existing embedding techniques on\nthe nodes of the line graph to learn edge embeddings is not enough in the\ncontext of knowledge graphs. Thus, we introduce the notion of triple line\ngraph. The second is an edge weighting mechanism both for line graphs derived\nfrom knowledge graphs and homogeneous graphs. The third is a strategy based on\ngraph walks on the weighted triple line graph that can preserve proximity\nbetween nodes. Embeddings are finally generated by adopting the SkipGram model,\nwhere sentences are replaced with graph walks. We evaluate our approach on\ndifferent real world (knowledge) graphs and compared it with related work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 09:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

Originally not meant to be connected to public networks, the use\ncases of Industry 4.0 require interconnectivity, often through insecure public\nnetworks.

However, their use is limited to a few\nthousand of training samples due to their cubic time complexity. In order to\nscale GPs to larger datasets, several sparse approximations based on so-called\ninducing points have been proposed in the literature. In this work we\ninvestigate the connection between a general class of sparse inducing point GP\nregression methods and Bayesian recursive estimation which enables Kalman\nFilter like updating for online learning. The majority of previous work has\nfocused on the batch setting, in particular for learning the model parameters\nand the position of the inducing points, here instead we focus on training with\nmini-batches. By exploiting the Kalman filter formulation, we propose a novel\napproach that estimates such parameters by recursively propagating the\nanalytical gradients of the posterior over mini-batches of the data. Compared\nto state of the art methods, our method keeps analytic updates for the mean and\ncovariance of the posterior, thus reducing drastically the size of the\noptimization problem.

Risk-spreading through spontaneous phenotypic variations is a known\nconcept in ecology, which is used to explain how species may survive when faced\nwith the evolutionary risks associated with temporally varying environments. In\norder to support a deeper understanding of the adaptive role of spontaneous\nphenotypic variations in fluctuating environments, we consider a system of\nnon-local partial differential equations modelling the evolutionary dynamics of\ntwo competing phenotype-structured populations in the presence of periodically\noscillating nutrient levels. The two populations undergo spontaneous phenotypic\nvariations at different rates. The phenotypic state of each individual is\nrepresented by a continuous variable, and the phenotypic landscape of the\npopulations evolves in time due to variations in the nutrient level. Exploiting\nthe analytical tractability of our model, we study the long-time behaviour of\nthe solutions to obtain a detailed mathematical depiction of evolutionary\ndynamics. The results suggest that when nutrient levels undergo small and slow\noscillations, it is evolutionarily more convenient to rarely undergo\nspontaneous phenotypic variations. Conversely, under relatively large and fast\nperiodic oscillations in the nutrient levels, which bring about alternating\ncycles of starvation and nutrient abundance, higher rates of spontaneous\nphenotypic variations confer a competitive advantage.

Dislocation pile-up in a soft\ngrain resulted in internal stresses in an adjacent hard grain which could be\nrelaxed by dislocation multiplication at localized Frank-Read sources, a\nprocess assisted by the provision of a relaxation time during a load hold. The\nrate of this process is suggested to be controlled by <c+a> pyramidal\ncross-slip and <a> basal junction formation. A high density of <a> prism\npile-ups is observed by dual slip, together with the nucleation of edge\ndislocations in the soft grain of a highly mis-oriented grain pair, increasing\nthe possibility of cracking. The stress concentration developed by such\npile-ups is found to be higher in dwell fatigue (single-ended pile-ups) than in\nLCF (double ended). Analytical modelling shows that the maximum normal stress\nproduced on the hard grain in dwell fatigue by this pile-up would be\nnear-basal, ~2.5 degree to (0002). This provides support for the dominant\nhypothesis for the rationalisation of dwell fatigue crack nucleation in Ti\nalloys, which derives from the Stroh pile-up model, and elaboration of the\nunderlying dislocation phenomena that result from load shedding and lead to\nbasal faceting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 10:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 09:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

This\nis especially true when ocrs are designed by recognizing characters. High word\naccuracies are critical to tasks like the creation of content in digital\nlibraries and text-to-speech applications. In order to detect and correct the\nmisrecognised words, it is common for an ocr module to employ a post-processor\nto further improve the word accuracy. However, conventional approaches to\npost-processing like looking up a dictionary or using a statistical language\nmodel (slm), are still limited. In many such scenarios, it is often required to\nremove the outstanding errors manually. We observe that the traditional\npost-processing schemes look at error words sequentially since ocrs process\ndocuments one at a time. We propose a cost-efficient model to address the error\nwords in batches rather than correcting them individually. We exploit the fact\nthat a collection of documents, unlike a single document, has a structure\nleading to repetition of words. Such words, if efficiently grouped together and\ncorrected as a whole can lead to a significant reduction in the cost.\nCorrection can be fully automatic or with a human in the loop. Towards this, we\nemploy a novel clustering scheme to obtain fairly homogeneous clusters. We\ncompare the performance of our model with various baseline approaches including\nthe case where all the errors are removed by a human. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our solution empirically by reporting more than 70% reduction in\nthe human effort with near perfect error correction.

Unlike other mixed-consistency solutions, ACTs can\nrely on efficient quorum-based protocols, such as Paxos. Hence, ACTs gracefully\ntolerate machine and network failures also for the strongly consistent\noperations. We formally study ACTs and demonstrate phenomena which are neither\npresent in purely eventually consistent nor strongly consistent systems. In\nparticular, we identify temporary operation reordering, which implies interim\ndisagreement between replicas on the relative order in which the client\nrequests were executed. When not handled carefully, this phenomenon may lead to\nundesired anomalies, including circular causality. We prove an impossibility\nresult which states that temporary operation reordering is unavoidable in\nmixed-consistency systems with sufficiently complex semantics. Our result is\nstartling, because it shows that apparent strengthening of the semantics of a\nsystem (by introducing strongly consistent operations to an eventually\nconsistent system) results in the weakening of the guarantees on the eventually\nconsistent operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 12:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 11:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

In general,\nTMAO forms highly consistent large loop or circle structures in high\nconcentrations. In contrast, urea is more tightly aggregated locally. Moreover,\nthe resulting hydrogen-bonding networks also demonstrate distinguishable\nfeatures. With the concentration increase, TMAO hydrogen-bonding networks vary\ngreatly in their total number of loop structures and large-sized loop\nstructures consistently increase. In contrast, urea hydrogen-bonding networks\nremain relatively stable with slight reduce of the total loop number. Moreover,\nthe persistent entropy (PE) is, for the first time, used in characterization of\nthe topological information of the aggregation and hydrogen-bonding networks.\nThe average PE systematically increases with the concentration for both TMAO\nand urea, and decreases in their hydrogen-bonding networks. But their PE\nvariances have totally different behaviors. Finally, topological features of\nthe hydrogen-bonding networks are found to be highly consistent with those from\nthe ion aggregation systems, indicating that our topological invariants can\ncharacterize intrinsic features of the \"structure making\" and \"structure\nbreaking\" systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 13:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

We also present an analysis of the attack approaches we\nexplored, explaining their limitations. In contrast to previous work, we\nconsider the attacks in a more realistic and challenging setting in which an\nattacker has access to recorded user data but does not have access to the\nauthentication model or its outputs.

To enhance the interpretability of classical PCA, various improved\nPCA methods have been proposed to date. Among these, a typical method is the\nso-called sparse PCA, which focuses on seeking sparse loadings. However, the\nperformance of these methods is still far from satisfactory due to their\nlimitation of using unsupervised learning methods; moreover, the class\nambiguity within the sample is high. To overcome this problem, this study\ndeveloped a new PCA method, which is named the Supervised Discriminative Sparse\nPCA (SDSPCA). The main innovation of this method is the incorporation of\ndiscriminative information and sparsity into the PCA model. Specifically, in\ncontrast to the traditional sparse PCA, which imposes sparsity on the loadings,\nhere, sparse components are obtained to represent the data. Furthermore, via\nlinear transformation, the sparse components approximate the given label\ninformation. On the one hand, sparse components improve interpretability over\ntraditional PCA, while on the other hand, they are have discriminative\nabilities suitable for classification purposes. A simple algorithm is developed\nand its convergence proof is provided. The SDSPCA has been applied to common\ncharacteristic gene selection (com-characteristic gene) and tumor\nclassification on multi-view biological data. The sparsity and classification\nperformance of the SDSPCA are empirically verified via abundant, reasonable,\nand effective experiments, and the obtained results demonstrate that SDSPCA\noutperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 14:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

Using a general ab\ninitio methodology which advances previous models towards a dynamic and more\nrealistic description of an electrode/electrolyte interface, we simulate for\nthe first time the nanoscopic structure of the Pt-water double layer and its\nresponse to an applied potential, in realistic solution conditions. We reveal\nthat the nanoscopic metal/surface structure and charging are not captured by\ntraditional capacitor models, as the electrode polarization is associated with\na charge oscillation within the double layer and a densification of the water\nlayer in contact with the electrode, both of which strongly depend on the\napplied potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interface dipole is not\ndetermined by the reorientation of the first water layer in contact with the\nelectrode, but by its charging state in combination with its number density,\nwhile water reorientation becomes relevant only in the second water layer.

In this work\nwe control the perovskite precursor concentration to fabricate a series of\nperovskite-based solar cells with different amounts of perovskite absorber. Low\nconcentration devices present the well-known dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs)\nimpedance pattern. As the amount of perovskite is increased, the characteristic\nimpedance spectra of thin-film perovskite solar cells (PSCs) arises. This\ntransition is characterized by a change in the working principles, determined\nby an evolution of the dominant capacitance: from the intermediate frequency\nchemical capacitance of TiO2 in devices with isolated perovskite domains, to a\nlarge low-frequency capacitance signal which divides the spectra in two\nsections, yet with no direct influence in final device performance. This study\nallows to link experimentally, in terms of impedance behavior, PSCs with the\nrest of solar cell devices via DSSCs. We observe that it is not possible to\nassign a single physical origin to the different resistances determined in the\nimpedance spectra except for the series resistance. In contrast, resistive\nelement present contributions from different physical processes, observing a\ntransport-recombination coupling. Based on this analysis we provide an\nequivalent circuit model to evaluate the impedance pattern of PSCs in terms of\nthe processes directly affecting the final performance (i.e. considering\ntransport-related and recombination-related losses), a crucial tool for further\ndevelopment of perovskite photovoltaics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 14:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 10:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 14:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

We propose a\nframework to sort elements that is algorithmically differentiable. We leverage\nthe fact that sorting can be seen as a particular instance of the optimal\ntransport (OT) problem on $\\mathbb{R}$, from input values to a predefined array\nof sorted values (e.g. $1,2,\\dots,n$ if the input array has $n$ elements).\nBuilding upon this link , we propose generalized CDFs and quantile operators by\nvarying the size and weights of the target presorted array. Because this\namounts to using the so-called Kantorovich formulation of OT, we call these\nquantities K-sorts, K-CDFs and K-quantiles.

In observations, halo mass is typically estimated from its\nrelation with other observables.

Exact correction for the bias is not easy,\nas predictions for the observables are typically model-dependent in\nsimulations. In this paper, we point out an interesting feature in the halo\nmass function of the concordence $\\Lambda$CDM model: the total halo mass within\neach evenly-spaced logarithmic mass bin is approximately the same over a large\nmass range. We show that this property allows us to construct an almost\nbias-free halo mass function using only an observable (as a halo mass\nestimator) and stacked weak lensing measurements as long as the scatter between\nthe true halo mass and the observable-inferred mass has a stable form in\nlogarithmic units.

The method starts by finding a solution on a\ncoarse mesh. Using this initial solution, the method then determines\nautomatically if the Hamiltonian is linear with respect to the control, and, if\nso, estimates the locations of the discontinuities in the control. The switch\ntimes are estimated by determining the roots of the switching functions, where\nthe switching functions are determined using estimates of the state and costate\nobtained from the collocation method. The accuracy of the switch times is then\nimproved on subsequent meshes by dividing the original optimal control problem\ninto multiple domains and including variables that define the locations of the\nswitch times.

Consistent with\nprevious scholarly literature, this work has found systemic bias against given\nnames popular among African-Americans in most embedding models examined. Gender\nbias in embedding models however appears to be multifaceted and often reversed\nin polarity to what has been regularly reported. Interestingly, using the\ncommon operationalization of the term bias in the fairness literature, novel\ntypes of so far unreported bias types in word embedding models have also been\nidentified. Specifically, the popular embedding models analyzed here display\nnegative biases against middle and working-class socioeconomic status, male\nchildren, senior citizens, plain physical appearance, Islamic religious faith,\nnon-religiosity and conservative political orientation. Reasons for the\nparadoxical underreporting of these bias types in the relevant literature are\nprobably manifold but widely held blind spots when searching for algorithmic\nbias and a lack of widespread technical jargon to unambiguously describe a\nvariety of algorithmic associations could conceivably be playing a role. The\ncausal origins for the multiplicity of loaded associations attached to distinct\ndemographic groups within embedding models are often unclear but the\nheterogeneity of said associations and their potential multifactorial roots\nraises doubts about the validity of grouping them all under the umbrella term\nbias.

Similarly, a thermosize\nvoltage is expected to be induced in a junction made by the same material but\nhaving different sizes, so-called thermosize junction. This is a consequence of\ndissimilarity in Seebeck coefficients due to differences in classical and/or\nquantum size effects in the same materials with different sizes. The studies on\nthermosize effects in literature are mainly based on semi-classical models\nunder relaxation time approximation or even simpler local equilibrium ones\nwhere only very general ideas and results have been discussed without\nconsidering quantum transport approaches and specific materials. To make more\nrealistic predictions for a possible experimental verification, here, we\nconsider ballistic thermosize junctions made by narrow and wide ($n$-$w$)\npristine graphene nanoribbons with perfect armchair edges and calculate the\nelectronic contribution to the thermosize voltage, at room temperature, by\nusing the Landauer formalism. The results show that the maximum thermosize\nvoltage can be achieved for semiconducting nanoribbons and it is about an order\nof magnitude larger than that of metallic nanoribbons. In the semiconducting\ncase, the thermosize voltage forms a characteristic plateau for a finite range\nof gating conditions. We demonstrate, through numerical calculations, that the\ninduced thermosize voltage per temperature difference can be in the scale of\nmV/K, which is high enough for experimental measurements. Owing to their high\nand persistent thermosize voltage values, graphene nanoribbons are expected to\nbe good candidate for device applications of thermosize effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 09:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The biggest threat for industrial\napplications arises from state-sponsored and criminal groups. Often, formerly\nunknown exploits are employed by these attackers, so-called 0-day exploits.\nThey cannot be discovered with signature-based intrusion detection. Thus,\nstatistical or machine learning based anomaly detection lends itself readily.\nThese methods especially, however, need a large amount of labelled training\ndata. In this work, an exemplary industrial use case with real-world industrial\nhardware is presented. Siemens S7 Programmable Logic Controllers are used to\ncontrol a real world-based control application using the OPC UA protocol: A\npump, filling and emptying water tanks. This scenario is used to generate\napplication specific network data. Furthermore, attacks are introduced into\nthis data set. This is done in three ways: First, the normal process is\nmonitored and captured. Common attacks are then synthetically introduced into\nthis data set. Second, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable\nLogic Controller program and executed live, the traffic is captured as well.\nThird, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller\nwhile still keeping the same output behaviour as in normal operation. An\nattacker could exploit an application but forge valid sensor output so that no\nanomaly is detected. Sensors are employed, capturing temperature, sound and\nflow of water to create data that can be correlated to the network data and\nused to still detect the attack. All data is labelled, containing the ground\ntruth, meaning all attacks are known and no unknown attacks occur. This makes\nthem perfect for training of anomaly detection algorithms.

To overcome this challenge, this paper\nproposes a multi-task learning method which is composed of three main\ncomponents: (1) multi-modal video question answering network that answers the\nquestion based on the both video and subtitle feature, (2) temporal retrieval\nnetwork that predicts the time in the video clip where the question was\ngenerated from and (3) modality alignment network that solves metric learning\nproblem to find correct association of video and subtitle modalities.

This feature allows for many advantages in\nproducing. Configuration and maintenance gets easier, as access to the given\nproduction unit is not necessarily coupled to physical presence. Customized\nproduction of goods is easily possible, reducing production times and\nincreasing throughput. There are, however, also dangers to the increasing\ntalkativeness of industrial production machines. The more open a system is, the\nmore points of entry for an attacker exist. Furthermore, the amount of data a\nproduction site also increases rapidly due to the integrated intelligence and\ninterconnectivity. To keep track of this data in order to detect attacks and\nerrors in the production site, it is necessary to smartly aggregate and\nevaluate the data. In this paper, we present a new approach for collecting,\naggregating and analysing data from different sources and on three different\nlevels of abstraction. Our model is event-centric, considering every occurrence\nof information inside the system as an event. In the lowest level of\nabstraction, singular packets are collected, correlated with log-entries and\nanalysed. On the highest level of abstraction, networks are pictured as a\nconnectivity graph, enriched with information about host-based activities.\nFurthermore, we describe our work in progress of evaluating our aggregation\nmodel on two different system settings. In the first scenario, we verify the\nusability of our model in a remote maintenance application. In the second\nscenario, we evaluate our model in the context of network sniffing and\ncorrelation with log-files. First results show that our model is a promising\nsolution to cope with increasing amounts of data and to correlate information\nfrom different types of sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 11:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

As this configuration ensures a long propagation distance, i.e.,\nsmall absorption into metal, and a good mode field confinement, i.e., high\ninteraction of the electric field with a germanium material, it is perfect for\na realization of plasmonic germanium photodetectors. Such a photodetector even\nwithout optimization provides a responsivity exceeding 1 A/W for both\nwavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm. To achieve such a responsivity, only a 5\n{\\mu}m-long waveguide is required for 1310 nm and 30 {\\mu}m-long for 1550 nm.\nWith optimization this value can be highly improved. In the proposed\narrangement a metal stripe simultaneously supports a propagating mode and\nserves as one of the electrodes, while the second electrode is located a short\ndistance from the waveguide. As a propagating mode is tightly confined to the\ngermanium ridge, the external electrode can be placed very close to the\nwaveguide without disturbing it. As such, the distance between electrodes can\nbe smaller than 350 nm which allows one to achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100\nGHz. However, as most of the carriers are generated inside a distance of 100 nm\nfrom a stripe, a bandwidth exceeding 150 GHz can be achieved for a bias voltage\nof -4 V.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 12:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
