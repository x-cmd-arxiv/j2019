In particular,\nthe Transformer model based on multi-head self-attention has recently achieved\ngreat success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, the\nvanilla algorithm computing the Transformer of an image with n pixels has\nO(n^2) complexity, which is often painfully slow and sometimes prohibitively\nexpensive for large-scale image data. In this paper, we propose a fast\nrandomized algorithm --- SCRAM --- that only requires O(n log(n)) time to\nproduce an image attention map. Such a dramatic acceleration is attributed to\nour insight that attention maps on real-world images usually exhibit (1)\nspatial coherence and (2) sparse structure. The central idea of SCRAM is to\nemploy PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence algorithm, to quickly pinpoint\nthe most compatible key (argmax) for each query first, and then exploit that\nknowledge to design a sparse approximation to non-local mean operations. Using\nthe argmax (mode) to dynamically construct the sparse approximation\ndistinguishes our algorithm from all of the existing sparse approximate methods\nand makes it very efficient. Moreover, SCRAM is a broadly applicable\napproximation to any non-local mean layer in contrast to some other sparse\napproximations that can only approximate self-attention. Our preliminary\nexperimental results suggest that SCRAM is indeed promising for speeding up or\nscaling up the computation of attention maps in the Transformer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 16:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

We first establish a representation\nresult stating that, under mild assumptions on the covariance operator of the\ncross-section, we can represent each FTS as the sum of a common component\ndriven by scalar factors loaded via functional loadings, and a mildly\ncross-correlated idiosyncratic component. Our model and theory are developed in\na general Hilbert space setting that allows for mixed panels of functional and\nscalar time series. We then turn to the identification of the number of\nfactors, and the estimation of the factors, their loadings, and the common\ncomponents. We provide a family of information criteria for identifying the\nnumber of factors, and prove their consistency. We provide average error bounds\nfor the estimators of the factors, loadings, and common component; our results\nencompass the scalar case, for which they reproduce and extend, under weaker\nconditions, well-established similar results. Under slightly stronger\nassumptions, we also provide uniform bounds for the estimators of factors,\nloadings, and common component, thus extending existing scalar results. Our\nconsistency results in the asymptotic regime where the number $N$ of series and\nthe number $T$ of time observations diverge thus extend to the functional\ncontext the \"blessing of dimensionality\" that explains the success of factor\nmodels in the analysis of high-dimensional (scalar) time series.

Nevertheless, a fast multi-phase\nAGN-driven outflow with speeds up to 1000km/s is detected close to the nucleus\nat 1kpc distance.

It is key to\nmany valuable applications, including community detection and network\ndismantling. Computing BC scores on large networks is computationally\nchallenging due to high time complexity. Many approximation algorithms have\nbeen proposed to speed up the estimation of BC, which are mainly\nsampling-based. However, these methods are still prone to considerable\nexecution time on large-scale networks, and their results are often exacerbated\nwhen small changes happen to the network structures. In this paper, we focus on\nidentifying nodes with high BC in a graph, since many application scenarios are\nbuilt upon retrieving nodes with top-k BC. Different from previous heuristic\nmethods, we turn this task into a learning problem and design an\nencoder-decoder based framework to resolve the problem. More specifcally, the\nencoder leverages the network structure to encode each node into an embedding\nvector, which captures the important structural information of the node. The\ndecoder transforms the embedding vector for each node into a scalar, which\ncaptures the relative rank of this node in terms of BC. We use the pairwise\nranking loss to train the model to identify the orders of nodes regarding their\nBC. By training on small-scale networks, the learned model is capable of\nassigning relative BC scores to nodes for any unseen networks, and thus\nidentifying the highly-ranked nodes.

Previous work is\ninconclusive about whether RNNs learn to attenuate their expectations for gaps\nin island constructions in particular or in any sufficiently complex syntactic\nenvironment. This paper gives new evidence for the former by providing control\nstudies that have been lacking so far.

We divide the sky\nbetween Galactic latitude |b|>5 deg and |b|<60 deg in 552 circular patches and\nwe study the cross-correlations between the TEB power spectra and the column\ndensity of each patch using the latest release of the Planck polarization data.\nWe find that the B-to-E power ratio (BB/EE) and the TE correlation ratio (rTE)\ndepend on column density. While the former increases going from the diffuse ISM\nto molecular clouds in the Gould Belt, the latter decreases. This systematic\nvariation must be related to actual changes in ISM properties. The data show\nsignificant scatter about this mean trend. The variations of BB/EE and rTE are\nobserved to be anti-correlated for all column densities. In the diffuse ISM,\nthe variance of these two ratios is consistent with a stochastic non-Gaussian\nmodel in which the values of BB/EE and rTE are fixed. We finally discuss the\ndependencies of TB and EB with column density, which are however hampered by\ninstrumental noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 22:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 09:25:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 15:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Each agent in the network can\naccess only its private objective function, while local information exchange is\npermitted between the neighbors. The proposed optimization algorithm combines a\nfixed-time convergent distributed parameter estimation scheme with a fixed-time\ndistributed consensus scheme as its solution methodology.

The results extend to\nthe class of possibly non-convex team objective functions satisfying only the\nPolyak-\\L ojasiewicz (PL) inequality. It is also shown that the proposed\ncontinuous-time scheme, when discretized using Euler's method, leads to\nconsistent discretization, i.e., the fixed-time convergence behavior is\npreserved under discretization.

Features\nwith code defects or design flaws can cause outages and significant degradation\nof user experience. The traditional method of code review and change management\ncan be time-consuming and error-prone. In order to make the feature rollout\nprocess safe and fast, this paper proposes a methodology for rolling out\nfeatures in an automated way using an adaptive experimental design. Under this\nframework, a feature is gradually ramped up from a small proportion of users to\na larger population based on real-time evaluation of the performance of\nimportant metrics. If there are any regression detected during the ramp-up\nstep, the ramp-up process stops and the feature developer is alerted. There are\ntwo main algorithm components powering this framework: 1) a continuous\nmonitoring algorithm - using a variant of the sequential probability ratio test\n(SPRT) to monitor the feature performance metrics and alert feature developers\nwhen a metric degradation is detected, 2) an automated ramp-up algorithm -\ndeciding when and how to ramp up to the next stage with larger sample size.\nThis paper presents one monitoring algorithm and three ramping up algorithms\nincluding time-based, power-based, and risk-based (a Bayesian approach)\nschedules. These algorithms are evaluated and compared on both simulated data\nand real data. There are three benefits provided by this framework for feature\nrollout: 1) for defective features, it can detect the regression early and\nreduce negative effect, 2) for healthy features, it rolls out the feature\nquickly, 3) it reduces the need for manual intervention via the automation of\nthe feature rollout process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 01:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

AFL's binary-only fuzzing mode, QEMU-AFL, is\ntypically 2-5X slower than its source-available fuzzing mode. The slowdown is\nlargely caused by the heavy dynamic instrumentation. Recent fuzzing techniques\nuse Intel Processor Tracing (PT), a light-weight tracing feature supported by\nrecent Intel CPUs, to remove the need of dynamic instrumentation. However, we\nfound that these PT-based fuzzing techniques are even slower than QEMU-AFL when\nfuzzing real-world programs, making them less effective than QEMU-AFL. This\npoor performance is caused by the slow extraction of code coverage information\nfrom highly compressed PT traces.\n  In this work, we present the design and implementation of PTrix, which fully\nunleashes the benefits of PT for fuzzing via three novel techniques. First,\nPTrix introduces a scheme to highly parallel the processing of PT trace and\ntarget program execution. Second, it directly takes decoded PT trace as\nfeedback for fuzzing, avoiding the expensive reconstruction of code coverage\ninformation. Third, PTrix maintains the new feedback with stronger feedback\nthan edge-based code coverage, which helps reach new code space and defects\nthat AFL may not. We evaluated PTrix by comparing its performance with the\nstate-of-the-art fuzzers. Our results show that, given the same amount of time,\nPTrix achieves a significantly higher fuzzing speed and reaches into code\nregions missed by the other fuzzers. In addition, PTrix identifies 35 new\nvulnerabilities in a set of previously well-fuzzed binaries, showing its\nability to complement existing fuzzers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 02:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

Quantum depletion of weakly interacting atomic\nBECs in thermal equilibrium is well understood theoretically but is difficult\nto measure. This is even more challenging in driven-dissipative systems such as\nexciton-polariton condensates(photons coupled to electron-hole pairs in a\nsemiconductor), since their nonequilibrium nature is predicted to suppress\nquantum depletion.

To improve detection rates,\norganizations often deploy an ensemble of detectors. While effective, this\napproach is computationally expensive, since every file - even clear-cut cases\n- needs to be analyzed by all detectors. Moreover, with an ever-increasing\nnumber of files to process, the use of ensembles may incur unacceptable\nprocessing times and costs (e.g., cloud resources). In this study, we propose\nSPIREL, a reinforcement learning-based method for cost-effective malware\ndetection.

Our evaluation on two\nmalware domains- Portable Executable (PE) and Android Application Package\n(APK)files - shows that SPIREL is both accurate and extremely\nresource-efficient: the proposed method either outperforms the best performing\nbaselines while achieving a modest improvement in efficiency, or reduces the\nrequired running time by ~80% while decreasing the accuracy and F1-score by\nonly 0.5%.

The protocols making up Bitcoin must therefore\naccommodate the growth of the network and ensure security. Security of the\nBitcoin network depends on connectivity between the nodes. Higher connectivity\nyields better security. In this paper we make two observations: (1) current\nconnectivity in the Bitcoin network is too low for optimal security; (2) at the\nsame time, increasing connectivity will substantially increase the bandwidth\nused by the transaction dissemination protocol, making it prohibitively\nexpensive to operate a Bitcoin node. Half of the total bandwidth needed to\noperate a Bitcoin node is currently used to just announce transactions. Unlike\nblock relay, transaction dissemination has received little attention in prior\nwork. We propose a new transaction dissemination protocol, Erlay, that not only\nreduces the bandwidth consumption by 40% assuming current connectivity, but\nalso keeps the bandwidth use almost constant as the connectivity increases. In\ncontrast, the existing protocol increases the bandwidth consumption linearly\nwith the number of connections. By allowing more connections at a small cost,\nErlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate,\nErlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin\nnode of a transaction.

We propose to formulate the domain adaption\ntask as an one-class classification problem with a novel domain similarity\nloss. Given the feature map of any image from a backbone network, a novel\ndomain adaptive attention model (DAAM) first automatically learns to separate\nthe feature map of an image to a domain-shared feature (DSH) map and a\ndomain-specific feature (DSP) map simultaneously.

By\nthe first one, the formalism of R\\'enyi entropy is transformed in the formalism\nof SPA entropy under general energy constraint and, by the second one, the\ngeneralized thermostatistics which corresponds to the linear constraint is\ntransformed into the one which corresponds to the escort constraint. Thus, we\nestablish the equivalence between four different thermostatistics formalisms\nbased on R\\'enyi and SPA entropies coupled with linear and escort constraints\nand we provide the transformation formulas. In this way we obtain a general\nframework which is applicable to the wide class of entropies and constraints\npreviously discussed in the literature.\n  As an example, we rederive maximum entropy distributions for Sharma-Mittal\nentropy and we establish new relationships between the corresponding\nthermodynamic potentials.

The first feature, which is common in phase-field models of\nfracture, is attained by regularizing a sharp interface geometry using a\nsurface density functional. The second feature, which is a unique advantage for\ncontact problems, is achieved by a new approach that calculates the stress\ntensor in the regularized interface region depending on the contact condition\nof the interface. Particularly, under a slip condition, this approach updates\nstress components in the slip direction using a standard contact constitutive\nlaw, while making other stress components compatible with stress in the bulk\nregion to ensure non-penetrating deformation in other directions. We verify the\nproposed phase-field method using stationary interface problems simulated by\ndiscrete methods in the literature. Subsequently, by allowing the phase field\nto evolve according to brittle fracture theory, we demonstrate the proposed\nmethod's capability for modeling crack growth with frictional contact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 07:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 10:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

All clustering methods have inherent merits and deficiencies.\nTherefore, they are only capable of clustering some specific types of data\nrobustly. In addition, the accuracies of the clustering methods rely heavily on\nthe characteristics of the data. In this paper, we propose a new clustering\nmethod based on the morphological operations. The morphological dilation is\nused to connect the data points based on their adjacency and form different\nconnected domains. The iteration of the morphological dilation process stops\nwhen the number of connected domains equals the number of the clusters or when\nthe maximum number of iteration is reached. The morphological dilation is then\nused to label the connected domains. The Euclidean distance between each data\npoint and the points in each labeled connected domain is calculated. For each\ndata point, there is a labeled connected domain that contains a point that\nyields the smallest Euclidean distance. The data point is assigned with the\nsame labeling number as the labeled connected domain. We evaluate and compare\nthe proposed method with state of the art clustering methods with different\ntypes of data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more\nrobust and generic for clustering two-dimensional or three-dimensional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 07:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

Besides, RS2ACF incorporates\nthe joint neighborhood reconstruction error over the new representations and\npredicted labels of both labeled and unlabeled data, so the manifold structures\ncan be preserved explicitly and adaptively in the representation space and\nlabel space at the same time.

However, the deep neural network currently\nfaces many challenges: 1) its effectiveness is heavily dependent on large\ndatasets, so the computational complexity is very high; 2) it is usually\nregarded as a black box model with poor interpretability. To meet the above\nchallenges, a more interpretable and scalable feature learning method, i.e.,\ndeep image feature learning with fuzzy rules (DIFL-FR), is proposed in the\npaper, which combines the rule-based fuzzy modeling technique and the deep\nstacked learning strategy. The method progressively learns image features\nthrough a layer-by-layer manner based on fuzzy rules, so the feature learning\nprocess can be better explained by the generated rules.

To address these limitations,\nthis work proposes a modelisation for dual-arm manipulators based on dynamic\nmovement primitives laying in two orthogonal spaces. The modularity and\nlearning capabilities of this model are leveraged to formulate a novel\nend-to-end learning-based framework which (i) learns a library of primitive\nskills from human demonstrations, and (ii) composes such knowledge\nsimultaneously and sequentially to confront novel scenarios. The feasibility of\nthe proposal is evaluated by teaching the iCub humanoid the basic skills to\nsucceed on simulated dual-arm pick-and-place tasks.

For\ngradient descent we identify the derivative of the activation function as\nproblematic especially in online learning. Hebbian-descent addresses these\nproblems by getting rid of the activation function's derivative and by\ncentering, i.e. keeping the neural activities mean free, leading to a\nbiologically plausible update rule that is provably convergent, does not suffer\nfrom the vanishing error term problem, can deal with correlated data, profits\nfrom seeing patterns several times, and enables successful online learning when\ncentering is used. We discuss its relationship to Hebbian learning, contrastive\nlearning, and gradient decent and show that in case of a strictly positive\nderivative of the activation function Hebbian-descent leads to the same update\nrule as gradient descent but for a different loss function. In this case\nHebbian-descent inherits the convergence properties of gradient descent, but we\nalso show empirically that it converges when the derivative of the activation\nfunction is only non-negative, such as for the step function for example.\nFurthermore, in case of the mean squared error loss Hebbian-descent can be\nunderstood as the difference between two Hebb-learning steps, which in case of\nan invertible and integrable activation function actually optimizes a\ngeneralized linear model. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 12:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to avoid teacher\nforcing and therefore alleviate exposure bias, there is little work showing how\nserious the exposure bias problem actually is. In this work, we focus on the\ntask of open-ended language generation, propose metrics to quantify the impact\nof exposure bias in the aspects of quality, diversity, and consistency. Our key\nintuition is that if we feed ground-truth data prefixes (instead of prefixes\ngenerated by the model itself) into the model and ask it to continue the\ngeneration, the performance should become much better because the\ntraining-generation discrepancy in the prefix is removed. Both automatic and\nhuman evaluations are conducted in our experiments. On the contrary to the\npopular belief in exposure bias, we find that the the distortion induced by the\nprefix discrepancy is limited, and does not seem to be incremental during the\ngeneration. Moreover, our analysis reveals an interesting self-recovery ability\nof the LM, which we hypothesize to be countering the harmful effects from\nexposure bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 15:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 01:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 04:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 16:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2020 19:18:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 15:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 01:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 03:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:38:34 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 19:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

From its structural characteristics, this polymorph arises from\nsignificant sp2-sp3 hybridization in the top layer that creates a 'faulted'\nhoneycomb motif of Si atoms. This top layer has an unusual periodic p-orbital\nstructure that can inter-digitate with the terminal bulk 'dangling bonds' to\ncreate a 2-D pi-bonded structure. This unusual bonding and new structure is\nimportant in understanding the nature of 2-D silicenes and 1-D honeycomb\nstructures, as well as the conversion of the 1-D pi-bonded chains of the 2x1\nstructure to the 2-D pi-bonded 5x5 or 7x7 structures. Such extended pi-bonded\nstructures can lead to non-covalent dispersion interactions that have not been\naccurately included in previous semiconductor surface calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 22:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

We argue that adopting a\n\"1/8 principle\" is far less restrictive, overall, than it might seem. One\neighth of the iron in the asteroid belt is more than a million times greater\nthan all of the Earth's estimated iron reserves and may suffice for centuries.\nA limit of some sort is needed because of the problems associated with\nexponential growth. Humans are poor at estimating the pace of such growth, so\nthe limitations of a resource are hard to recognize before the final three\ndoubling times which take utilization successively from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2, and\nthen to the point of exhaustion. Population growth and climate change are\ninstances of unchecked exponential growth. Each places strains upon ouru\navailable resources. Each is a problem we would like to control but attempts to\ndo so at this comparatively late stage have not been encouraging. Our limited\nability to see ahead suggests that we should set ourselves a 'tripwire' that\ngives us at least 3 doubling times as leeway, i.e. when 1/8 of Solar System\nresources are close to being exploited. At a 3.5 percent growth rate for the\nspace economy, comparable to that of the iron use from the beginning of the\nIndustrial Revolution until now, the 1/8 point would be reached after 400\nyears. At that point the 20 year doubling time of a 3.5 percent growth rate\nmeans that only 60 years would remain to transition the economic system to new\n\"steady state\" conditions. The rationale for adopting the 1/8 principle now is\nthat it may be far easier to implement in principle restrictions at an early\nstage, rather than later, when vested and competing interests have come into\nexistence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 19:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}
