We use low-fidelity\nmodels to derive biasing densities for importance sampling and then fuse the\nimportance sampling estimators such that the fused multifidelity estimator is\nunbiased and has mean-squared error lower than or equal to that of any of the\nimportance sampling estimators alone. By fusing all available estimators, the\nmethod circumvents the challenging problem of selecting the best biasing\ndensity and using only that density for sampling. A rigorous analysis shows\nthat the fused estimator is optimal in the sense that it has minimal variance\namongst all possible combinations of the estimators. The asymptotic behavior of\nthe proposed method is demonstrated on a convection-diffusion-reaction partial\ndifferential equation model for which $10^5$ samples can be afforded.

Current segmentation methods mainly utilize 2D and 3D deep neural\nnetworks. The 2D networks take image slices as input to produce coarse\nsegmentation in less processing time, whereas the 3D networks take the whole\nimage volumes to generated fine-detailed segmentation with more computational\nburden. In order to obtain accurate fine-grained segmentation efficiently, in\nthis paper, we propose an end-to-end Feature-Fused Context-Encoding Network for\nbrain structure segmentation from MR (magnetic resonance) images. Our model is\nimplemented based on a 2D convolutional backbone, which integrates a 2D\nencoding module to acquire planar image features and a spatial encoding module\nto extract spatial context information. A global context encoding module is\nfurther introduced to capture global context semantics from the fused 2D\nencoding and spatial features. The proposed network aims to fully leverage the\nglobal anatomical prior knowledge learned from context semantics, which is\nrepresented by a structure-aware attention factor to recalibrate the outputs of\nthe network. In this way, the network is guaranteed to be aware of the\nclass-dependent feature maps to facilitate the segmentation.

Our framework instead leverages photometric\nconsistency between multiple views as supervisory signal for learning depth\nprediction in a wide baseline MVS setup.

Some device vendors have recently come under\nscrutiny for potentially invasive private data collection practices and other\npotentially harmful or unwanted behavior of the pre-installed apps on their\ndevices. Yet, the landscape of pre-installed software in Android has largely\nremained unexplored, particularly in terms of the security and privacy\nimplications of such customizations. In this paper, we present the first\nlarge-scale study of pre-installed software on Android devices from more than\n200 vendors. Our work relies on a large dataset of real-world Android firmware\nacquired worldwide using crowd-sourcing methods. This allows us to answer\nquestions related to the stakeholders involved in the supply chain, from device\nmanufacturers and mobile network operators to third-party organizations like\nadvertising and tracking services, and social network platforms. Our study\nallows us to also uncover relationships between these actors, which seem to\nrevolve primarily around advertising and data-driven services. Overall, the\nsupply chain around Android's open source model lacks transparency and has\nfacilitated potentially harmful behaviors and backdoored access to sensitive\ndata and services without user consent or awareness. We conclude the paper with\nrecommendations to improve transparency, attribution, and accountability in the\nAndroid ecosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 17:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

Edit distance is most commonly\nencountered within the context of strings, where Wagner and Fischer's string\nedit distance is perhaps the most well-known. However, edit distance is not\nlimited to strings. For example, there are several edit distance measures for\npermutations, including Wagner and Fischer's string edit distance since a\npermutation is a special case of a string. However, another edit distance for\npermutations is Kendall tau distance, which is the number of pairwise element\ninversions. On permutations, Kendall tau distance is equivalent to an edit\ndistance with adjacent swap as the edit operation. A permutation is often used\nto represent a total ranking over a set of elements. There exist multiple\nextensions of Kendall tau distance from total rankings (permutations) to\npartial rankings (i.e., where multiple elements may have the same rank), but\nnone of these are suitable for computing distance between sequences.

Here we present a new\nset of data obtained using a novel technique: direct measurements of momentum\ntransfer to a spacecraft from individual particle impacts. This technique is\nmade possible by the extreme precision of the instruments flown on the LISA\nPathfinder spacecraft, a technology demonstrator for a future space-based\ngravitational wave observatory that operated near the first Sun-Earth Lagrange\npoint from early 2016 through Summer of 2017. Using a simple model of the\nimpacts and knowledge of the control system, we show that it is possible to\ndetect impacts and measure properties such as the transferred momentum (related\nto the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel, and location of\nimpact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic\nsearch for impacts during 4348 hours of Pathfinder data.

The first concept transforms the momentum balance for a control\nvolume moving at the local mean velocity, breaking the momentum exchange down\nto its basic components. The Reynolds stress gradient budget confirms this\nalternative interpretation of the turbulence momentum balance, as validated\nwith DNS data. The second concept of maximum entropy principle states that\nturbulent kinetic energy in fully-developed flows will distribute itself until\nthe maximum entropy is attained while conforming to the physical constraints.\nBy equating the maximum entropy state with maximum allowable (viscous)\ndissipation at a given Reynolds number, along with other constraints, we arrive\nat function forms (inner and outer) for the turbulent kinetic energy.

ChIP-Seq generates large\nquantities of data which can be difficult to process and analyse, particularly\nfor organisms with contig based genomes. Contig-based genomes often have poor\nannotations for cis-elements, for example enhancers, that are important for\ngene expression. Poorly annotated genomes make a comprehensive analysis of\nChIP-Seq data difficult and as such standardized analysis pipelines are\nlacking. Methods: We report a computational pipeline that utilizes traditional\nHigh-Performance Computing techniques and open source tools for processing and\nanalysing data obtained from ChIP-Seq. We applied our computational pipeline\n\"Rapid Analysis of ChIP-Seq data\" (RACS) to ChIP-Seq data that was generated in\nthe model organism Tetrahymena thermophila, an example of an organism with a\ngenome that is available in contigs. Results: To test the performance and\nefficiency of RACs, we performed control ChIP-Seq experiments allowing us to\nrapidly eliminate false positives when analyzing our previously published data\nset. Our pipeline segregates the found read accumulations between genic and\nintergenic regions and is highly efficient for rapid downstream analyses.\nConclusions: Altogether, the computational pipeline presented in this report is\nan efficient and highly reliable tool to analyze genome-wide ChIP-Seq data\ngenerated in model organisms with contig-based genomes.\n  RACS is an open source computational pipeline available to download from:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/mjponce/racs --or--\nhttps://gitrepos.scinet.utoronto.ca/public/?a=summary&p=RACS\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 19:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

Different resolution criteria such as two-point\nresolution and the resolution obtained from the image spectrum (diffraction\npattern) are compared and demonstrated with simulated examples. Resolution\ncriteria for spatial lateral and axial resolution are derived, and their\napplication in imaging with coherent and incoherent (noncoherent) waves is\nconsidered. It is shown that for coherent light, the classical Abbe and\nRayleigh resolution criteria do not provide an accurate estimation of the\nlateral and axial resolution. Lateral and axial resolution criteria based on an\nevaluation of the spectrum of the diffracted wave provide a more precise\nestimation of the resolution for coherent and incoherent light. It is also\nshown that resolution criteria derived in approximation of the far-field\nimaging regime can be applied for the near-field (Fresnel) regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 19:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

The first problem is the effective use of high-resolution\nimages with pretrained standard architectures for image classification. The\nsecond problem is the high class imbalance encountered in real-world\nmulti-class datasets. Methods: To use high-resolution images, we propose a\nnovel patch-based attention architecture that provides global context between\nsmall, high-resolution patches. We modify three pretrained architectures and\nstudy the performance of patch-based attention. To counter class imbalance\nproblems, we compare oversampling, balanced batch sampling, and class-specific\nloss weighting. Additionally, we propose a novel diagnosis-guided loss\nweighting method which takes the method used for ground-truth annotation into\naccount. Results: Our patch-based attention mechanism outperforms previous\nmethods and improves the mean sensitivity by 7%. Class balancing significantly\nimproves the mean sensitivity and we show that our diagnosis-guided loss\nweighting method improves the mean sensitivity by 3% over normal loss\nbalancing. Conclusion: The novel patch-based attention mechanism can be\nintegrated into pretrained architectures and provides global context between\nlocal patches while outperforming other patch-based methods. Hence, pretrained\narchitectures can be readily used with high-resolution images without\ndownsampling. The new diagnosis-guided loss weighting method outperforms other\nmethods and allows for effective training when facing class imbalance.\nSignificance: The proposed methods improve automatic skin lesion\nclassification. They can be extended to other clinical applications where\nhigh-resolution image data and class imbalance are relevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 20:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 09:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

The challenges arise from three perspectives.\nFirst, the state-of-the-art pool-based super teaching method applies\nmixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) which does not scale well to very\nlarge data sets. Second, it is desirable to restrict data access of the\nteachers to only their own data during the collaboration stage to mitigate\nprivacy leaks. Finally, the teaching collaboration should be\ncommunication-efficient since large communication overheads can cause\nsynchronization delays between teachers.\n  To address these challenges, we formulate collaborative teaching as a\nconsensus and privacy-preserving optimization process to minimize teaching\nrisk. We theoretically demonstrate the necessity of collaboration between\nteachers for improving the learner's learning.

In this work, we aim to address three issues of the classical\nRKHS based techniques. First, they require the RKHS to be known a priori, which\nis unrealistic in many applications. Furthermore, the choice of RKHS affects\nthe shape and smoothness of the solution, thus impacting its performance.\nSecond, RKHSs are ill-equipped to deal with heterogeneous degrees of\nsmoothness, i.e., with functions that are smooth in some parts of their domain\nbut vary rapidly in others. Finally, the computational complexity of evaluating\nthe solution of these methods grows with the number of data points, rendering\nthese techniques infeasible for many applications. Though kernel learning,\nlocal kernel adaptation, and sparsity have been used to address these issues,\nmany of these approaches are computationally intensive or forgo optimality\nguarantees. We tackle these problems by leveraging a novel integral\nrepresentation of functions in RKHSs that allows for arbitrary centers and\ndifferent kernels at each center.

The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the\n158 $\\mu$m-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and\nphysical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation\nregions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this\nsynergy. Aims. Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158\n$\\mu$m-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. Methods. We present\nnew and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15--230 GHz\nwith ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion~A (M42). We\ncomplement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158 $\\mu$m-[CII]\nline. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and\nthe dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud.\nResults. In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron\ndensity, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric\nheating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR\nstructure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium\ncluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the\nionized carbon layer, the C$^{+}$/C/CO interface.

Conclusions. This work provides\nadditional observational support for the use of CRRLs and the 158 $\\mu$m-[CII]\nline as complementary tools to study dense and diffuse PDRs, and highlights the\nusefulness of CRRLs as probes of the C$^{+}$/C/CO interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 20:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

The cap deformation reveals the forces of\nthe flowing liquids exerted onto the interface and allows estimating the local\ndriving pressure gradient for the bypass flow. The characterizing parameters\nare identified as the bypass length, the wall film thickness, the viscosity\nratio between both phases and the Ca-number.

Rivoire has recently proposed an evolutionary\nscenario that explains these properties as a generic byproduct of selection for\nexquisite discrimination between very similar ligands. The initial claim was\nsupported by two classes of basic examples: continuous protein models with\nsmall numbers of degrees of freedom, on which the development of a\nconformational switch was established, and a 2-dimensional spin glass model\nsupporting the rest of the statement. This work aimed to clarify the\nimplication of the exquisite discrimination for smooth models with large number\nof degrees of freedom, the situation closer to real biological systems. With\nthe help of differential geometry, jet-space analysis, and transversality\ntheorems, it is shown that the claim holds true for any generic flexible system\nthat can be described in terms of smooth manifolds. The result suggests that,\nindeed, evolutionary solutions to the exquisite discrimination problem, if\nexist, are located near a codimension-1 subspace of the appropriate genotypical\nspace. This constraint, in turn, gives rise to a potential for the allosteric\nregulation of the discrimination via generic conformational changes upon\nbinding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 21:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

To examine the\nlocal hydrodynamic behavior, non-invasive optical measurements techniques like\nparticle tracking velocimetry (PTV) or (micro)particle image velocimetry\n((\\textmu)PIV) are the method of choice, since they provide precise velocity\nmeasurement with excellent spatial resolution. Such optical approaches require\nrefractive index matching (RIM) of the involved flow phases to prevent optical\ndistortion due to light refraction and reflection at the interfaces.\nEstablished RIM approaches often provide a single one degree of freedom which\nis sufficient to match the RI of the flow phases solely.

The randomly perturbed Einstein\nequations are then interpreted as a stochastic n-dimensional nonlinear\ndynamical system.

Computing the consistent answers of a fixed conjunctive query on a\ngiven inconsistent database can be a coNP-hard problem, even though every fixed\nconjunctive query is efficiently computable on a given consistent database.\n  We designed, implemented, and evaluated CAvSAT, a SAT-based system for\nconsistent query answering. CAvSAT leverages a set of natural reductions from\nthe complement of consistent query answering to SAT and to Weighted MaxSAT. The\nsystem is capable of handling unions of conjunctive queries and arbitrary\ndenial constraints, which include functional dependencies as a special case. We\nreport results from experiments evaluating CAvSAT on both synthetic and\nreal-world databases. These results provide evidence that a SAT-based approach\ncan give rise to a comprehensive and scalable system for consistent query\nanswering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 22:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

The controller, through\na write operation, writes the hidden layer feature vector of the NN to the\nexternal working memory and can also update this information with the observed\nerror in the output. Through a read operation, the controller retrieves\ninformation from the working memory to modify the final control signal. First,\nwe consider a simpler estimation problem to theoretically study the effect of\nan external memory and prove that the estimation accuracy can be improved by\nincorporating memory. We then consider a model reference NN adaptive controller\nfor linear systems with matched uncertainty to implement and illustrate our\nideas. We prove that the resulting controller leads to a Uniformly Bounded (UB)\nstable closed loop system.

The\nimportance of a road user depends on both its visual dynamics, e.g.,\nappearance, motion and location, in the driving scene and the driving goal,\n\\emph{e.g}., the planned path, of the ego vehicle. We propose a novel framework\nthat incorporates both visual model and goal representation to conduct OIE. To\nevaluate our framework, we collect an on-road driving dataset at traffic\nintersections in the real world and conduct human-labeled annotation of the\nimportant objects. Experimental results show that our goal-oriented method\noutperforms baselines and has much more improvement on the left-turn and\nright-turn scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of using object\nimportance for driving control prediction and demonstrate that binary brake\nprediction can be improved with the information of object importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 00:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

In very young systems, the PWN\ndrives a shock into the innermost supernova (SN) material, giving rise to\nlow-excitation lines and an infrared (IR) continuum from heated dust grains.\nThese observational signatures make it possible to cleanly measure the\nproperties of the deepest SN ejecta layers that can, in turn, provide\nconstraints on the SN progenitor. We present Herschel Space Observatory far-IR\nobservations of the PWN in the Galactic SNR Kes 75, containing the youngest\nknown pulsar that exhibited magnetar-like activity. We detect highly-broadened\noxygen and carbon line emission that arises from the SN ejecta encountered by\nthe PWN. We also detect a small amount (a few thousandths of a solar mass) of\nshock-heated dust that spatially coincides with the ejecta material and was\nlikely formed in the SN explosion. We use hydrodynamical models to simulate the\nevolution of Kes 75 and find that the PWN has so far swept up 0.05-0.1 solar\nmasses of SN ejecta. Using explosion and nucleosynthesis models for different\nprogenitor masses in combination with shock models, we compare the predicted\nfar-IR emission with the observed line intensities and find that lower mass and\nexplosion energy SN progenitors with mildly mixed ejecta profiles and\ncomparable abundance fractions of carbon and oxygen are favored over higher\nmass ones. We conclude that Kes 75 likely resulted from an 8-12 solar-mass\nprogenitor, providing further evidence that lower energy explosions of such\nprogenitors can give rise to magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 00:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 16:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

AC-RLNC is adaptive to the channel\ncondition, that the algorithm estimates, and is causal, as coding depends on\nthe particular erasure realizations, as reflected in the feedback\nacknowledgments. Specifically, the proposed model can learn the erasure pattern\nof the channel via feedback acknowledgments, and adaptively adjust its\nretransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. By those\nadjustments, AC-RLNC achieves the desired delay and throughput, and enables\ntransmission with zero error probability. We upper bound the throughput and the\nmean and maximum in order delivery delay of AC-RLNC, and prove that for the\npoint to point communication channel in the non-asymptotic regime the proposed\ncode may achieve more than 90% of the channel capacity. To upper bound the\nthroughput we utilize the minimum Bhattacharyya distance for the AC-RLNC code.\nWe validate those results via simulations. We contrast the performance of\nAC-RLNC with the one of selective repeat (SR)-ARQ, which is causal but not\nadaptive, and is a posteriori. Via a study on experimentally obtained\ncommercial traces, we demonstrate that a protocol based on AC-RLNC can,\nvis-`a-vis SR-ARQ, double the throughput gains, and triple the gain in terms of\nmean in order delivery delay when the channel is bursty.

In HPC systems,\nthe multi-level cell (MLC) technique is used to significantly increase device\ndensity and decrease the cost, which however leads to much weaker endurance\nthan the single-level cell (SLC) counterpart. Although wear-leveling techniques\ncan mitigate this weakness in MLC, the improvements upon MLC-based NVM become\nvery limited due to not achieving uniform write distribution before some cells\nare really worn out. To address this problem, our paper proposes a\nself-adaptive wear-leveling (SAWL) scheme for MLC-based NVM.

We explore vortex dynamics under these conditions by\nsolving the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a rotating, harmonic\ntrap with an axisymmetric `moat' of deeper pinning sites on an otherwise\nuniform, corotating pinning grid. The moat is designed to resemble crudely a\nradially dependent pinning profile in a neutron star crust, although the values\nof the pinning potential are not astrophysically realistic due to computational\nconstraints. It is shown that vortices accumulate in the moat, inducing large\ndifferential rotation which can trigger mass unpinning events.

Specifically, the Deep Flow\nCompletion network follows a coarse-to-fine refinement to complete the flow\nfields, while their quality is further improved by hard flow example mining.\nFollowing the guide of the completed flow, the missing video regions can be\nfilled up precisely. Our method is evaluated on DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets\nqualitatively and quantitatively, achieving the state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of inpainting quality and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 03:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

A major drawback of\nthese systems is their lack of generalization across different conditions. This\nproblem can be solved by training models on large amounts of labeled data from\nthe target domain, which is expensive and time-consuming. Another approach is\nto increase the generalization of the models. An effective way to achieve this\ngoal is by regularizing the models through multitask learning (MTL), where\nauxiliary tasks are learned along with the primary task. These methods often\nrequire the use of labeled data which is computationally expensive to collect\nfor emotion recognition (gender, speaker identity, age or other emotional\ndescriptors). This study proposes the use of ladder networks for emotion\nrecognition, which utilizes an unsupervised auxiliary task. The primary task is\na regression problem to predict emotional attributes.

In\nthe first control law, each agent receives pure velocity feedback from its\nneighbor. In the second control law, each agent receives its velocity relative\nto its neighbors. The attacker selects a subset of nodes in which to inject a\nsignal, and its objective is to maximize the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the system\nfrom the attack signal to the output. The defender improves the resilience of\nthe system by adding self-feedback loops to certain nodes of the network with\nthe objective of minimizing the system's $\\mathcal{H}_2$ norm.

However, it is not clear if the\ngeometry of curved surfaces induces this topological change. In this study, we\nfirst show the curved surface geometry-induced topological changes in a planar\nstable wave by numerically solving an excitable reaction-diffusion equation on\na bell-shaped surface. We determined two necessary conditions for inducing\ntopological change: the characteristic length of the curved surface (i.e.,\nheight of the bell-shaped structure) should be larger than the width of the\nwave and than a threshold independent of the wave width. As for the geometrical\nmechanism of the latter, we found that a bifurcation of the globally minimum\ngeodesics (i.e. minimal paths) on the curved surface leads to the topological\nchange.

The behavior of\nthese maps depends on the source size in comparison with the caustic. If the\nsource size is so smaller than the caustic curve, the maximum polarization\nsignal occurs while the source edge is crossing the nearest folds to the\nposition of the primary. When the source size is larger than the caustic, the\npolarization signal maximizes over a circular ring around the primary whose\nradius normalized to the source radius is ~0.96. In cusp caustic crossings, the\npolarization curves have three peaks, the largest and widest one happens when\nthe source edge is on the corner of the cusp and the source center is inside\nthe caustic curve. When the source is entirely inside the caustic, the\npolarization signal significantly decreases.

Even a single noise-corrupted agent can bias the\nmodel training.

We\nassume that each local agent (teacher) have the resources to verify a small\nportions of trusted instances, which may not by itself be adequate for\nlearning.

However,\nno dataset has previously been available to test the performance and\nlimitations of these models over extended timescales and with sufficient\nsensitivity. Here we present the results of such a test with an optimal dataset\nof observations of pulsar J0034-0534, taken with the German stations of LOFAR.\nWe conclude that the spherical approximation performs systematically better\nthan the two-phase model at almost all angular distances, with a residual\nroot-mean-square (rms) given by the two-phase model being up to 28% larger than\nthe result obtained with the spherical approximation. Nevertheless, the\nspherical approximation remains insufficiently accurate in modelling the\nSolar-wind delay (especially within 20 degrees of angular distance from the\nSun), as it leaves timing residuals with rms values that reach the equivalent\nof 0.3 microseconds at 1400 MHz.

In the\nshort term, broadband observations or simultaneous observations at low\nfrequencies are the most promising way forward to correct for Solar-wind\ninduced delay variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 10:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

It has been known that their\nannihilation inside the NS core causes late-time heating, with which the\nsurface temperature becomes a constant value of $T_s \\simeq (2-3) \\times 10^3$\nK for the NS age $t \\gtrsim 10^{6-7}$ years. This conclusion is, however, drawn\nbased on the assumption that the beta equilibrium is maintained in NSs\nthroughout their life, which turns out to be invalid for rotating pulsars. The\nslowdown in the pulsar rotation drives the NS matter out of beta equilibrium,\nand the resultant imbalance in chemical potentials induces late-time heating,\ndubbed as rotochemical heating. This effect can heat a NS up to $T_s \\simeq\n10^6$ K for $t \\simeq 10^{6-7}$ years. In fact, recent observations found\nseveral old NSs whose surface temperature is much higher than the prediction of\nthe standard cooling scenario and is consistent with the rotochemical heating.\nMotivated by these observations, in this letter, we reevaluate the significance\nof the DM heating in NSs, including the effect of the rotochemical heating. We\nthen show that the signature of DM heating can still be detected in old\nordinary pulsars, while it is concealed by the rotochemical heating for old\nmillisecond pulsars. To confirm the evidence for the DM heating, however, it is\nnecessary to improve our knowledge on nucleon pairing gaps as well as to\nevaluate the initial period of the pulsars accurately. In any cases, a\ndiscovery of a very cold NS can give a robust constraint on the DM heating, and\nthus on DM models. To demonstrate this, as an example, we also discuss the case\nthat the DM is the neutral component of an electroweak multiplet, and show that\nan observation of a NS with $T_s \\lesssim 10^3$ K imposes a stringent\nconstraint on such a DM candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 10:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 09:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

Due to their deployment flexibility, UAVs are\nbeing considered as an efficient solution for collecting information data from\nground nodes and transmitting it wirelessly to the network. In this paper, a\nUAV-assisted wireless network is studied, in which energy-constrained ground\nnodes are deployed to observe different physical processes. In this network, a\nUAV that has a time constraint for its operation due to its limited battery,\nmoves towards the ground nodes to receive status update packets about their\nobserved processes. The flight trajectory of the UAV and scheduling of status\nupdate packets are jointly optimized with the objective of achieving the\nminimum weighted sum for the age-of-information (AoI) values of different\nprocesses at the UAV, referred to as weighted sum-AoI. The problem is modeled\nas a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action\nspaces.

Several simulation\nscenarios are considered to showcase the convergence of the proposed deep RL\nalgorithm. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that the proposed deep RL\napproach can significantly improve the achievable sum-AoI per process compared\nto the baseline policies, such as the distance-based and random walk policies.\nThe impact of various system design parameters on the optimal achievable\nsum-AoI per process is also shown through extensive simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 10:14:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 02:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

It is\nwell known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation the population density\nhas a positive effect on broadband diffusion. Hence, we measure the effect of\nthe population density on the determinants of broadband diffusion throughout\nthe postal codes of Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest\nthat the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density\nfollow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong\nstrength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we argue that\nthe Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network Operators to satisfy\nambitious Universal Service Obligations without the need for a Universal\nService Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition\nvia equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee\nlicenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract\ninvestment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies\nencouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer\ncooperatives.

With the consideration of robustness and accuracy,\nthe WENO-Z scheme is adopted for spatial reconstruction in the current\nhigher-order scheme. Statistical quantities are compared with the high-order\ncompact finite difference scheme to determine the spatial and temporal\ncriterion for DNS. According to the grid and time convergence study, it can be\nconcluded that the minimum spatial resolution parameter $\\kappa_{max} \\eta_0\n\\ge 2.71$ and the maximum temporal resolution parameter $\\Delta\nt_{ini}/\\tau_{t_0} \\leq 5.58/1000$ are adequate for HGKS to resolve the\ncompressible isotropic turbulence, where $\\kappa_{max}$ is the maximum resolved\nwave number, $\\Delta t_{ini}$ is the initial time step, $\\eta_0$ and\n$\\tau_{t_0}$ are the initial Kolmogorov length scale and the\nlarge-eddy-turnover time.

We aim to\ncharacterize the dust, H2O and CO2 gas spatial distribution in the inner coma.\nTo do this we performed a quantitative analysis of the release of dust and gas\nand compared the observed H2O production rate with the one calculated using a\nthermo-physical model. For this study we selected OSIRIS WAC images at 612 nm\n(dust) and VIRTIS-M image cubes at 612 nm, 2700 nm (H2O) and 4200 nm (CO2). We\nmeasured the average signal in a circular annulus, to study spatial variation\naround the comet, and in a sector of the annulus, to study temporal variation\nin the sunward direction with comet rotation, both at a fixed distance of 3.1\nkm from the comet centre. The spatial correlation between dust and water, both\ncoming from the sun-lit side of the comet, shows that water is the main driver\nof dust activity in this time period. The spatial distribution of CO2 is not\ncorrelated with water and dust. There is no strong temporal correlation between\nthe dust brightness and water production rate as the comet rotates. The dust\nbrightness shows a peak at 0deg sub-solar longitude, which is not pronounced in\nthe water production. At the same epoch, there is also a maximum in CO2\nproduction. An excess of measured water production, with respect to the value\ncalculated using a simple thermo-physical model, is observed when the head lobe\nand regions of the Southern hemisphere with strong seasonal variations are\nilluminated. A drastic decrease in dust production, when the water production\n(both measured and from the model) displays a maximum, happens when typical\nNorthern consolidated regions are illuminated and the Southern hemisphere\nregions with strong seasonal variations are instead in shadow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 12:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

This benefit comes for the cost that the system matrix needs to be\nre-calibrated whenever the scan parameters, particle types or even the particle\nenvironment (e.g. viscosity or temperature) changes. One route for reducing the\ncalibration time is the sampling of the system matrix at a subset of the\nspatial positions of the intended field-of-view and employing system matrix\nrecovery.

In this study, we examine the possibility\nthat silicate grains with an organic mantle, which we call Organic-Mantled\nGrains (OMGs), form planetesimals through direct coagulation. Organic mantles\nare commonly found in interplanetary dust particles, and laboratory experiments\nshow that they are softer than silicates, in particular in warm environments.\nThis, combined with the theory of particle adhesion, implies that OMGs are\nstickier than bare silicate grains. Because organic mantles can survive up to\n400 K, silicate grains inside the water snow line in protoplanetary disks can\nin principle hold such mantles. We construct a simple grain adhesion model to\nestimate the threshold collision velocity below which aggregates of OMGs can\ngrow.

The MILP\napproach is sound and complete for bounded specifications, but such strong\ncorrectness guarantees come at the price of exponential complexity in the\nnumber of predicates and the time bound of the specification. In this work, we\npropose an alternative synthesis paradigm that relies on Bayesian optimization\nrather than mixed integer programming. This relaxes the completeness guarantee\nto probabilistic completeness, but is significantly more efficient: our\napproach scales polynomially in the STL time-bound and linearly in the number\nof predicates.

This is due to the lack of\navailable 3D datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To address\nthis, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about 29 minutes of 4D scans\ncaptured at 60 fps and synchronized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a\nneural network on our dataset that factors identity from facial motion. The\nlearned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Character Animation) takes any speech\nsignal as input - even speech in languages other than English - and\nrealistically animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on subject\nlabels during training allows the model to learn a variety of realistic\nspeaking styles. VOCA also provides animator controls to alter speaking style,\nidentity-dependent facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball\nrotations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is the only realistic 3D\nfacial animation model that is readily applicable to unseen subjects without\nretargeting. This makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, virtual\nreality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker, speech, or language is\nnot known in advance.

In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of\narms on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward\nthat the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their\nexpectations. In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear,\nand the performance of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz\nconstant to encapsulate the function's nonlinearity. This may lead to loose\nregret bounds, since by itself, a large gradient does not necessarily cause a\nlarge regret, but only in regions where the uncertainty in the reward's\nparameters is high. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new smoothness\ncriterion, which we term \\emph{Gini-weighted smoothness}, that takes into\naccount both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the\narms.

The MATCHING CUT problem asks whether a graph has a matching cut, and has\nbeen intensively studied in the literature. Motivated by a question posed by\nKomusiewicz et al. [IPEC 2018], we introduce a natural generalization of this\nproblem, which we call $d$-CUT: for a positive integer $d$, a $d$-cut is a\nbipartition of the vertex set of a graph into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that\neach vertex has at most $d$ neighbors across the cut. We generalize (and in\nsome cases, improve) a number of results for the MATCHING CUT problem. Namely,\nwe begin with an NP-hardness reduction for $d$-CUT on $(2d+2)$-regular graphs\nand a polynomial algorithm for graphs of maximum degree at most $d+2$. The\ndegree bound in the hardness result is unlikely to be improved, as it would\ndisprove a long-standing conjecture in the context of internal partitions. We\nthen give FPT algorithms for several parameters: the maximum number of edges\ncrossing the cut, treewidth, distance to cluster, and distance to co-cluster.\nIn particular, the treewidth algorithm improves upon the running time of the\nbest known algorithm for MATCHING CUT. Our main technical contribution,\nbuilding on the techniques of Komusiewicz et al. [IPEC 2018], is a polynomial\nkernel for $d$-CUT for every positive integer $d$, parameterized by the\ndistance to a cluster graph. We also rule out the existence of polynomial\nkernels when parameterizing simultaneously by the number of edges crossing the\ncut, the treewidth, and the maximum degree. Finally, we provide an exact\nexponential algorithm slightly faster than the naive brute force approach\nrunning in time $O^*(2^n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 15:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

A strong electric field induced by gas motions can heat ionized gas\nparticles and can thereby affect the ionization balance in the disks. Our\nprevious studies revealed that in dusty protoplanetary disks, the Ohmic\nconductivity decreases with increasing electric field strength until the\nelectrical breakdown of the disk gas occurs. In this study, we extend our\nprevious work to more general cases where both electric and magnetic fields\naffect the motion of plasma particles, allowing us to study the impacts of\nplasma heating on all non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic, Hall, and ambipolar\ndiffusion. We find that the upper limit on the electric current we previously\nderived applies even in the presence of magnetic fields. Although the Hall and\nambipolar resistivities can either increase or decrease with electric field\nstrength depending on the abundance of charged dust grains, the Ohmic\nresistivity always increases with electric field strength. An\norder-of-magnitude estimate suggests that a large-scale electric current\ngenerated by gas motions in the inner part of protoplanetary disks could exceed\nthe upper limit. This implies that MHD motions of the inner disk, such as the\nmotion driven by the Hall-shear instability, could either get suppressed or\ntrigger electrical breakdown (lightning discharge). This may have important\nimplications for gas accretion and chondrule formation in the inner part of\nprotoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 15:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The difference between these two methods is that the latter model\nhas an autoregressive term while the former model has only the input-related\nterm. The first system is a plunging cylinder in a low-Reynolds number flow,\nwhere the flow stable (Re < 47). Although the training data can be fitted well\nwith both methods, the linear Volterra method requires a higher model order\nthan the ARX model for the same accuracy. Comparison of the frequency response\nindicates that the ARX model approximates the frequency response more closely,\nwhile the frequency response at high Reynolds number is over-fitted by Volterra\nseries.

The convergence of the model\nwith respect to delay orders, at different Mach numbers and mean angles of\nattack, is studied in detail.

Despite many existing works have extensively\nhandled the issue of service selection, it remains an open question in the case\nwhere requests from multiple users are performed simultaneously by a certain\nset of shared candidate services. Meanwhile, there exist some constraints\nenforced on the context of service selection, e.g. service placement location\nand contracts between users and service providers. In this paper, we focus on\nthe QoS-aware service selection with constraints from a fairness aspect, with\nthe objective of achieving max-min fairness across multiple service requests\nsharing candidate service sets.

The theory underlines significance of the\nspeed equation. When applied to numerical simulation of HF, the theory reveals\nthree distinct issues: (i) modeling the central part of a HF; (ii) modeling the\nnear-front zone; and (iii) tracing changes in the shape of a fracture contour.\nModeling the central part leads to a stiff system of ODE in time, what strongly\ncomplicates its integration. For explicit schemes, it requires small time steps\nto meet the CFL condition. For implicit schemes, it requires proper\npreconditioners. The gains and flaws of the two strategies are discussed. It is\nnoted that a rough spatial mesh may be used in the central part. Modeling the\nnear-front zone reveals the vital role of the speed equation for HF modeling by\nany method. Its asymptotic analysis has resulted in the fundamental concept of\nthe universal asymptotic umbrella. For the near-front zone, it is also\nestablished that a notable part of the zone adjacent to the front propagates\nvirtually as a simple wave. This implies that the CFL condition of stability\nfor this zone is much less restrictive than for the central part of the\nfracture. Of essence is also that the wave-like propagation of the near front\nzone makes preferable upwind schemes of time stepping. On whole, the analysis\nimplies that explicit time stepping may be complementing, competitive and even\nsuperior over implicit integration. Tracing changes in the front shape appears\nmerely in 3D problems when the contour changes its form. The problem, being\nessentially geometrical, it may be solved separately by various methods,\nincluding fast marching, level set and the simplest string/marker methods. In\n1D cases, it does not arise at all.\n  Quantitative estimations and numerical examples illustrate the theoretical\nconclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 09:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}
