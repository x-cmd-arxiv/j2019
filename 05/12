The elementary\nconstituents of deep learning models are neurons, which can be considered as\nfunctions that receive inputs and produce an output that is a weighted sum of\nthe inputs fed through an activation function. Several models of neurons were\nproposed in the course of the years that are all based on learnable parameters\ncalled weights. In this paper we present a new type of artificial neuron, the\ndouble-weight neuron,characterized by additional learnable weights that lead to\na more complex and accurate system.

The efficiency of the traditional RF sources\n(klystrons, IOTs, solid-state amplifiers) in comparison to magnetrons is lower\nand the cost of unit of RF power is significantly higher. Typically, the cost\nof RF sources and their operation is a significant part of the total project\ncost and operation. The magnetron-based RF sources with a cost of power unit of\n1-3 dollars per Watt would significantly reduce the capital and operation costs\nin comparison with the traditional RF sources.

It allows operation in CW and pulse modes (at large duty factor). For\npulsed operation this technique does not require pulse modulators to form RF\npulses.

However, it is\nnot yet clear to what extent this account generalizes to semantic domains other\nthan color. Here we show that it generalizes to two qualitatively different\nsemantic domains: names for containers, and for animals. First, we show that\ncontainer naming in Dutch and French is near-optimal in the IB sense, and that\nIB broadly accounts for soft categories and inconsistent naming patterns in\nboth languages. Second, we show that a hierarchy of animal categories derived\nfrom IB captures cross-linguistic tendencies in the growth of animal\ntaxonomies. Taken together, these findings suggest that fundamental\ninformation-theoretic principles of efficient coding may shape semantic\ncategories across languages and across domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 17:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Many previous works discretize 3D points to voxels and\nthen use lattice-based methods to process and learn 3D spatial information;\nhowever, this leads to inevitable discretization errors. In this work, we\nhandle raw 3D points without such compromise. The proposed networks follow the\nautoencoder framework with a focus on designing the decoder. The encoder adopts\nsimilar architectures as in PointNet. The decoder involves three novel modules.\nThe folding module folds a canonical 2D lattice to the underlying surface of a\n3D point cloud, achieving coarse reconstruction; the graph-topology-inference\nmodule learns a graph topology to represent pairwise relationships between 3D\npoints, pushing the latent code to preserve both coordinates and pairwise\nrelationships of points in 3D point clouds; and the graph-filtering module\ncouples the above two modules, refining the coarse reconstruction through a\nlearnt graph topology to obtain the final reconstruction. The proposed decoder\nleverages a learnable graph topology to push the codeword to preserve\nrepresentative features and further improve the unsupervised-learning\nperformance. We further provide theoretical analyses of the proposed\narchitecture. In the experiments, we validate the proposed networks in three\ntasks, including 3D point cloud reconstruction, visualization, and transfer\nclassification. The experimental results show that (1) the proposed networks\noutperform the state-of-the-art methods in various tasks; (2) a graph topology\ncan be inferred as auxiliary information without specific supervision on graph\ntopology inference; and (3) graph filtering refines the reconstruction, leading\nto better performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 18:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 05:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

One way of improving spectral efficiency is to\nshare the spectrum amongst different coexisting networks and serve multiple\ndevices simultaneously. Spectrum sharing mechanisms for coexistence of a\nlicensed network, such as LTE, with an unlicensed network, such as Wi-Fi, are\nbeing considered in the recent literature and standardizations. In order to\nenable the coexistence between licensed and unlicensed users, it is necessary\nto include interference mitigation techniques to protect the licensed primary\nusers (PUs) from harmful interference. Typical interference mitigation\nmechanisms are based on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio (CR), wherein\nunlicensed secondary users (SUs) observe the spectrum and utilize it when\nlicensed PUs are inactive. Thus, the SUs utilize empty time-slots in the shared\nspectrum to avoid the interference. The spectral efficiency can be further\nimproved if the SUs are allowed to transmit concurrently with PUs by exploiting\nthe spatial dimension provided by multiple antenna techniques. The underlay CR\nparadigm allows such coexistence where SUs transmit its signal in the same\ntime-slots as PUs by exploiting the spatial and frequency resources in the\nnetwork. In order to exploit the spatial dimension, SUs can utilize the\nlocation coordinates of PUs to steer its signal away from PUs to mitigate the\ninterference. The SU transmitter can also employ multiple antenna techniques to\nserve a large number of devices. Further, the SUs can utilize frequency bands\noccupied by PUs by dynamically selecting the frequency band that provides the\nhighest rate. In this work, we develop techniques for PU location estimation,\nspatial resource allocation and frequency band selection for SUs in underlay CR\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 18:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Our results\ndemonstrate the importance of non-linear set function, and suggest that linear\ngraph filtering with non-linear set function is an efficient and powerful\nscheme for modeling existing graph classification benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 19:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 04:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 22:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

While\nnearly all studies rely on a CO2 feed, we show herein that aqueous bicarbonate\nsolutions can also be electrochemically converted into CO gas at meaningful\nrates in a flow cell. We achieved this result in a flow cell containing a\nbipolar membrane (BPM) and a silver nanoparticle catalyst on a porous carbon\nsupport. Electrolysis upon a N2-saturated 3.0-M potassium bicarbonate\nelectrolyte solution yields CO with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.CO) of 81% at 25\nmA cm-2 and 37% at 100 mA cm-2. This output is comparable to the analogous\nexperiment where the electrolyte is saturated with gaseous CO2 (faradaic\nefficiency for CO is 78% at 25 mA cm-2 and 35% at 100 mA cm-2). The H+ flux\nfrom the BPM is critical to this chemistry in that it reacts with the\nbicarbonate feed to generate CO2, which is then reduced to CO at the gas\ndiffusion electrode. These results are important in that they show that the\naddition of gaseous CO2 to bicarbonate electrolytes is not necessary in order\nto obtain reduced carbon products with a flow cell architecture. This process\noffers a means of using electrolysis to bypass the thermally-intensive step of\nextracting CO2 from bicarbonate solutions generated in carbon capture schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 19:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

Limitations on payload and endurance of these small\nrobots have prompted researchers to explore the use of bimodal aerial-surface\nlocomotion as a strategy to prolong operation time while retaining a high\nvantage point. In this work, we propose the use of ``ceiling effects'' as a\npower conserving strategy for small rotorcraft to perch on an overhang. In the\nvicinity of a ceiling, spinning propellers generate markedly higher thrust. To\nunderstand the observed aerodynamic phenomena}, momentum theory and blade\nelement method are employed to describe the thrust, power, and rotational rate\nof spinning propellers in terms of propeller-to-ceiling distance. The models,\nwhich take into account the influence of neighboring propellers as present in\nmultirotor vehicles, are verified using two propeller types 23-mm and 50-mm\nradii in various configurations on a benchtop setup. The results are consistent\nwith the proposed models. In proximity to the ceiling, power consumption of\npropellers with 23-mm radius arranged in a quadrotor configuration was found to\nreduce by a factor of three. To this end, we present a conceptual prototype\nthat demonstrates the use of ceiling effects for perching maneuvers.

We obtained a time series of high-resolution FEROS spectra\nat the 2.2-m telescope at La Silla of the very hot Jupiter hosting planet\nWASP-18b and show that our upper limit is consistent with the expectations.\nThis is the first analysis of its kind using 2-m class telescopes, and serves\nto highlight their potential. In this context, we then proceed to discuss the\nsuitability of this class of telescopes for the upcoming flood of\nscientifically interesting targets from TESS space mission, and propose a\nmethodology to select the most promising targets. This is of particular\nsignificance given that observing time on 2-m class telescopes is more readily\navailable than on large 8-m class facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 08:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses\nthe power system. In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving and\ncollusion-resistant charging coordination centralized and decentralized schemes\nfor the smart grid. The centralized scheme is used in case of robust\ncommunication infrastructure that connects the ESUs to the utility, while the\ndecentralized scheme is useful in case of infrastructure not available or\ncostly. In the centralized scheme, each energy storage unit should acquire\nanonymous tokens from a charging controller (CC) to send multiple charging\nrequests to the CC via the aggregator. CC can use the charging requests to\nenough data to run the charging coordination scheme, but it cannot link the\ndata to particular ESUs or reveal any private information. Our centralized\nscheme uses a modified knapsack problem formulation technique to maximize the\namount of power delivered to the ESUs before the charging requests expire\nwithout exceeding the available maximum charging capacity. In the decentralized\nscheme, several ESUs run the scheme in a distributed way with no need to\naggregator or CC. One ESU is selected as a head node that should decrypt the\nciphertext of the aggregated messages of the ESUs' messages and broadcast it to\nthe community while not revealing the ESUs' individual charging demands. Then,\nESUs can coordinate charging requests based on the aggregated charging demand\nwhile not exceeding the maximum charging capacity. Extensive experiments and\nsimulations are conducted to demonstrate that our schemes are efficient and\nsecure against various attacks, and can preserve ESU owner's privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 08:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 22:45:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 05:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

Remarkably, the outcomes of such\nstudy can be employed to set fundamental connections among WP and the CrAs and\nMnP superconductors belonging to the same space group. One of the key features\nof the resulting electronic structure is represented by the occurrence of\nmultiple band crossings along specific high symmetry lines of the Brilloiun\nzone. In particular, we demonstrate that the eight-fold band degeneracy\nobtained along the SR path at (kx,ky)=(Pi,Pi) is due to inversion-time reversal\ninvariance and a pair of nonsymmorphic symmetries. The presence of multiple\ndegenerate Fermi points along the SR direction constraints the topology of the\nFermi surface, which manifests distinctive marks when considering its evolution\nupon band filling variation. If the Fermi level crosses the bands along the SR\nline as it happens at the nominal filling of the MnP, these Fermi surfaces are\nopen or closed Fermi pockets. Moving the relative position of the Fermi level\naway from the eight-fold degenerate bands as for the WP and CrAs compounds, the\nelectronic changeover exhibits a simultaneous modification of the Fermi surface\ndimensionality and topology. Four two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface sheets are\ncentered around the SR line with a corrugated profile along the kz direction.\nMoreover, we show that the spin-orbit interaction determines a selective\nremoval of the band degeneracy and, consequently, a splitting of the quasi 2D\nFermi sheets, as it happens in WP.

Through analyzing the differential property of surfaces, we\nshow that the conventional discrete Laplacian operator with uniform weights is\nnot applicable to feature points at which the surface is non-differentiable and\nthe second order derivatives do not exist. To overcome this difficulty, we\npropose a Half-kernel Laplacian Operator (HLO) as an alternative to the\nconventional Laplacian. Given a vertex v, HLO first finds all pairs of its\nneighboring vertices and divides each pair into two subsets (called half\nwindows); then computes the uniform Laplacians of all such subsets and\nsubsequently projects the computed Laplacians to the full-window uniform\nLaplacian to alleviate flipping and degeneration. The half window with least\nregularization energy is then chosen for v. We develop an iterative approach to\napply HLO for surface denoising. Our method is conceptually simple and easy to\nuse because it has a single parameter, i.e., the number of iterations for\nupdating vertices. We show that our method can preserve features better than\nthe popular uniform Laplacian-based denoising and it significantly alleviates\nthe shrinkage artifact.

A key question for\napplying RL to traffic signal control is how to define the reward and state.\nThe ultimate objective in traffic signal control is to minimize the travel\ntime, which is difficult to reach directly. Hence, existing studies often\ndefine reward as an ad-hoc weighted linear combination of several traffic\nmeasures. However, there is no guarantee that the travel time will be optimized\nwith the reward. In addition, recent RL approaches use more complicated state\n(e.g., image) in order to describe the full traffic situation.

Among them,\nimproving the urban transportation efficiency is one of the most prominent\ntopics. Recent studies have proposed to use reinforcement learning (RL) for\ntraffic signal control. Different from traditional transportation approaches\nwhich rely heavily on prior knowledge, RL can learn directly from the feedback.\nOn the other side, without a careful model design, existing RL methods\ntypically take a long time to converge and the learned models may not be able\nto adapt to new scenarios.

Through the phase competition modeling, our model\nachieves invariance to symmetrical cases such as flipping and rotation in\ntraffic flow.

Based on the\nflat metric which is a fundamental distance between currents, we derive\nFlatGAN, a formulation in the spirit of generative adversarial networks but\ngeneralized to $k$-currents. In our theoretical contribution we prove that the\nflat metric between a parametrized current and a reference current is Lipschitz\ncontinuous in the parameters. In experiments, we show that the proposed shift\nto $k>0$ leads to interpretable and disentangled latent representations which\nbehave equivariantly to the specified oriented tangent planes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 14:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

A decision support system formalizes\nonline decision making as a map from up-to-date information to a recommended\ndecision. Online estimation of an optimal decision strategy from streaming data\nrequires simultaneous estimation of components of the underlying system\ndynamics as well as the optimal decision strategy given these dynamics; thus,\nthere is an inherent trade-off between choosing decisions that lead to improved\nestimates and choosing decisions that appear to be optimal based on current\nestimates. Thompson (1933) was among the first to formalize this trade-off in\nthe context of choosing between two treatments for a stream of patients; he\nproposed a simple heuristic wherein a treatment is selected randomly at each\ntime point with selection probability proportional to the posterior probability\nthat it is optimal. We consider a variant of Thompson sampling that is simple\nto implement and can be applied to large and complex decision problems. We show\nthat the proposed Thompson sampling estimator is consistent for the optimal\ndecision support system and provide rates of convergence and finite sample\nerror bounds.
